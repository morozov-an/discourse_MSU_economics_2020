"1","2","Redesigning Supply Chains using Blockchain-Enabled Circular Economy and COVID-19 Experiences The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed businesses and societies to the shortfalls of normal patterns of production, consumption, and their long-lasting impact on supply chains. In this opinion paper, we provide insights from the COVID-19 pandemic for making supply chains more resilient, transparent, and sustainable. These insights include supply chains needing to develop localization, agility, and digitization (LAD) characteristics. We link LAD to a potential solution using blockchain technology and circular economy principle capabilities. Use cases are used to show how blockchain-enabled circular economy practices can support supply chain LAD efforts. Supply chain tracking, tracing, and responsiveness can be supported through blockchain-enabled circular economy practices. One result of identifying these relationships include solutions and insights at multiple levels and stakeholders – individual, organizational, supply chain, governmental, and community. These crisis-related observations and findings set a future research foundation for sustainable production and consumption. © 2020 Agility; Blockchain technology; Circular economy; COVID-19; Digitization; Localization; Supply chain sustainability  Recombining place: COVID-19 and community action networks in South Africa The lockdown response taken by many governments in flattening the curve of coronavirus infections has of course increased the reliance on digital tools to enable work (for those able to do so) and social interaction. There are emergent, somewhat contingent, and coproductive dynamics at work between platforms and urban life and space with the contextual specificities of each, no doubt, leading to different ICT-informed solutions. In South Africa, the state has taken a phased but stronghold approach with unfortunate impacts on livelihoods and food security, especially those in the informal economy and those with part-time or insecure employment. The community action network (CAN) initiative started as a means to enable neighbourhood assistance through WhatsApp groups in Cape Town. In this article, the author reflects on how this initiative reflects the early hopes of William Mitchell (and others) that saw the potential for informational spaces to become more democratic as interfaces of connection. In Cape Town, one may see Mitchell's vision fulfilled. © The Author(s) 2020 Coronavirus; Platform Urbanism; Recombination; Technology COVID-19; democracy; epidemic; health services; innovation; recombination; technology adoption; viral disease; Cape Town; South Africa; Western Cape; Coronavirus Increased plastic pollution due to COVID-19 pandemic: Challenges and recommendations Plastics have become a severe transboundary threat to natural ecosystems and human health, with studies predicting a twofold increase in the number of plastic debris (including micro and nano-sized plastics) by 2030. However, such predictions will likely be aggravated by the excessive use and consumption of single-use plastics (including personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves) due to COVID-19 pandemic. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the effects of COVID-19 on macroplastic pollution and its potential implications on the environment and human health considering short- and long-term scenarios; addressing the main challenges and discussing potential strategies to overcome them. It emphasises that future measures, involved in an emergent health crisis or not, should reflect a balance between public health and environmental safety as they are both undoubtedly connected. Although the use and consumption of plastics significantly improved our quality of life, it is crucial to shift towards sustainable alternatives, such as bio-based plastics. Plastics should remain in the top of the political agenda in Europe and across the world, not only to minimise plastic leakage and pollution, but to promote sustainable growth and to stimulate both green and blue- economies. Discussions on this topic, particularly considering the excessive use of plastic, should start soon with the involvement of the scientific community, plastic producers and politicians in order to be prepared for the near future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The Chinese term for this health services value is jing hua xin ling, psychological destressing. Here we present the first case where optimal tourist infrastructure is influenced by including mental health. Using a multi-stage, cross-lingual, differential stakeholder method, we analyse conflicts between road- and roadless-access tourism in the very large new Sanjiangyuan National Park, Qinghai, which offers jing hua xin ling to domestic tourists from eastern-seaboard cities. This provides a powerful tourism attraction, and hence economic opportunity, for the region around the park. If these mental health aspects are included, together with their direct and indirect consequences for tourism, then roadlessness is preferable to new roads. Similar infrastructure conflicts occur for park tourism worldwide, and jing hua xin ling can provide a global theoretical framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Adventure; COVID-19; Culture; Health; Protected area expenditure; global economy; health services; infrastructure; mental health; national park; tourism economics; tourist attraction; China; Qinghai; Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve SARS-CoV-2 in environmental perspective: Occurrence, persistence, surveillance, inactivation and challenges The unprecedented global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is depicting the distressing pandemic consequence on human health, economy as well as ecosystem services. So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (βCoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The surge mitigation is complicated and associates many factors, including the pandemic status, policy, socioeconomics and resident behaviours. Modelling and analytics with spatial-temporal big urban data are required to assist the mitigation of the pandemic. This study proposes a novel perspective to analyse the spatial-temporal potential exposure risk of residents by capturing human behaviours based on spatial-temporal car park availability data. Near real-time data from 1,904 residential car parks in Singapore, a classical megacity, are collected to analyse car mobility and its spatial-temporal heat map. The implementation of the circuit breaker, a COVID-19 measure, in Singapore has reduced the mobility and heat (daily frequency of mobility) significantly at about 30.0%. It contributes to a 44.3%–55.4% reduction in the transportation-related air emissions under two scenarios of travelling distance reductions. Urban sustainability impacts in both environment and economy are discussed. The spatial-temporal potential exposure risk mapping with space-time interactions is further investigated via an extended Bayesian spatial-temporal regression model. The maximal reduction rate of the defined potential exposure risk lowers to 37.6% by comparison with its peak value. The big data analytics of changes in car mobility behaviour and the resultant potential exposure risks can provide insights to assist in (a) designing a flexible circuit breaker exit strategy, (b) precise management via identifying and tracing hotspots on the mobility heat map, and (c) making timely decisions by fitting curves dynamically in different phases of COVID-19 mitigation. The proposed method has the potential to be used by decision-makers worldwide with available data to make flexible regulations and planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Air-emission reduction; Car mobility behaviour; COVID-19; Flexible lockdown strategy; Risk mitigation; Spatial-temporal analysis Advanced Analytics; Behavioral research; Curve fitting; Data Analytics; Decision making; Electric circuit breakers; Flexible electronics; Garages (parking); Regression analysis; Flexible circuit; Human behaviours; Near real-time datum; Potential exposure; Regression model; Space-time interactions; Spatial temporals; Urban sustainability; Sustainable development A critical review of the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and ecosystems and opportunities for circular economy strategies The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, but the world is still reeling from its aftermath. Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus. These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Issues such as recession phase in which the economy will find itself, the increase in GIG economy and entire societies are discussed in the article. The article explores the problems associated with the onset of the economic crisis and the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in countries with small open economies (SOE). It was proved that the key challenges the small open economies countries will face are primarily the devaluation of the national currency, the massive closure of small and micro businesses, the growth of social problems, etc. The review of the literature, as well as reports from financial institutions, show that the economies of individual countries are entering a phase of stagnation and recession. In the coming years, the economy will be affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancing will change nature of employment and working places will shift to GIG-economy. Exactly these factors will expectedly provoke the growth of socio-economic crises in the country. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country's economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015–2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic. Therefore, stricter laws must be enacted to protect the environment in Egypt. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Absorbing aerosol index; Carbon monoxide and ozone; COVID-19; Environmental impacts in Egypt; Medical and municipal solid wastes; Nitrogen dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; disease prevalence; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; groundwater pollution; nitrogen dioxide; recycling; satellite data; solid waste; viral disease; Alexandria [Egypt]; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt; Coronavirus Challenges and strategies for effective plastic waste management during and post COVID-19 pandemic The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the complexities of plastic waste management. Our improved, hyper-hygienic way of life in the fear of transmission has conveniently shifted our behavioral patterns like the use of PPE (Personal protective equipment), increased demand for plastic-packaged food and groceries, and the use of disposable utensils. The inadequacies and inefficiencies of our current waste management system to deal with the increased dependence on plastic could aggravate its mismanagement and leakage into the environment, thus triggering a new environmental crisis. Mandating scientific sterilization and the use of sealed bags for safe disposal of contaminated plastic wastes should be an immediate priority to reduce the risk of transmission to sanitation workers. Investments in circular technologies like feedstock recycling, improving the infrastructure and environmental viability of existing techniques could be the key to dealing with the plastic waste fluxes during such a crisis. Transition towards environmentally friendly materials like bioplastics and harboring new sustainable technologies would be crucial to fighting future pandemics. Although the rollbacks and relaxation of single-use plastic bans may be temporary, their likely implications on the consumer perception could hinder our long-term goals of transitioning towards a circular economy. Likewise, any delay in building international willingness and participation to curb any form of pollution through summits and agendas may also delay its implementation. Reduction in plastic pollution and at the same time promoting sustainable plastic waste management technologies can be achieved by prioritizing our policies to instill individual behavioral as well as social, institutional changes. Incentivizing measures that encourage circularity and sustainable practices, and public-private investments in research, infrastructure and marketing would help in bringing the aforementioned changes. Individual responsibility, corporate action, and government policy are all necessary to keep us from transitioning from one disaster to another. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The error correction terms (ECT) and cointegration processing tools have been applied in studies for identifying possible transmission mechanisms between distinct time series. This paper adopts the vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate the dynamic coupling between the pandemics (e.g., the COVID-19, EBOLA, MERS and SARS) and the evolution of key stocks exchange indices (e.g., Dow-Jones, S&P 500, EuroStoxx, DAX, CAC, Nikkei, HSI, Kospi, S&P ASX, Nifty and Ibov). The results show that the shocks caused by the diseases significantly affected the markets. Nonetheless, except for the COVID-19, the stock exchange indices reveal a sustained and fast recovering when an identical length time window of 79 days is analyzed. In addition, our findings contribute to point a higher volatility for all financial indices during the COVID-19, a strong impact over the Ibov-Brazil and its poor recover when compared to the other indices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to study why coronavirus became so meaningful for worldwide life. On one side many countries closed their boarders to prevent coronavirus spreading. On another side some people said that coronavirus is no scared than simple influence. Where is true? The health effects and mortality of coronavirus and influenza were compared. Situation Reports of World Health Organization have been analyzed and signs of Black Swan event considered. Total confirmed cases, total, deaths, and Rate of coronavirus distribution was calculated based on Situation Reports of the World Health Organization. To conclude this paper Coronavirus Pandemic recognized as Black Swan event according to considered figures and facts from recent references. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2019-nCov; Black Swan event; Collapse; Coronavirus; Coronavirus impact; Coronavirus Pandemic; COVID-19; Economy impact; Financial consequences; Housing Boom; Social impact  Unlocking challenges and opportunities presented by COVID-19 pandemic for cross-cutting disruption in agri-food and green deal innovations: Quo Vadis? COVID-19 pandemic is on a trajectory to cause catastrophic global upheaval with the potential to alter geopolitical and socio-economic norms. Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first ‘Green Deal’ initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19. Candidate areas for future consideration will focus on climate action, digitization, manufacturing, and sustainable food production, security, and waste mitigation. Recommendations are also provided to facilitate community transitioning, training, enterprise, and employment to low carbon economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus replicates in the host cells and is seemingly much more virulent compared to other flu viruses, as well as the SARS-CoV-1. The respiratory complications of the disease include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, and pulmonary fibrosis. Nanoceria (NC) is a versatile rare earth nanoparticle with remarkable catalase and superoxide dismutase mimetic redox regenerative properties. Interestingly, NC possesses promising anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic properties, making it an attractive tool to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 as well as the associated systemic complications. Until now, there is no clinically approved vaccine or drug for the treatment of COVID-19, and the conquest to find a novel therapy for this global havoc is being undertaken at a warlike pace. Herein, based on preclinical evidence, we hypothesize that NC owing to its unique pharmacological properties, might be an attractive preclinical candidate to win the battle over COVID-19. Further, it may be used as a prevention or treatment strategy in combination with other drugs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Lung fibrosis; Nanoceria; SARS-CoV-2 Enzymes; Medical applications; Rare earths; Viruses; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Anti-inflammatories; Global economies; Pharmacological properties; Pulmonary fibrosis; Rare earth nanoparticles; Super oxide dismutase; Systemic inflammation; Diseases; cerium oxide nanoparticle; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; nanocrystal; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; transforming growth factor beta; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antifibrotic activity; antioxidant activity; antiviral activity; Article; chronic inflammation; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug inhibition; drug mechanism; human; lung fibrosis; nanomedicine; oxidative stress; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TGF beta signaling Preventing carbon emission retaliatory rebound post-COVID-19 requires expanding free trade and improving energy efficiency Existing studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp drop in carbon emissions in 2020. A recent example of the impact of sudden extreme events on carbon emissions occurred in the 2008 global financial crisis, in which carbon emissions droped in 2009, but jumped in 2010. This study is aimed to discuss how to prevent the retaliatory growth of carbon emissions post COVID-19 through learning the lessons from analysis of short-term and long-term drivers of carbon emissions. This study explored the short-term (annual) effects (population scale. affluence level, carbon intensity, energy intensity) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emissions in the world, different income groups and selected countries before and after the 2008 financial crisis using LMDI technique. In addition, this study explored the long-term effects (energy consumption per capita, energy structure, energy intensity, foreign direct investment, and trade openness) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emission in the world and different income groups from 1990 to 2014 using VAR technique. The decomposition results of short-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that the deterioration in energy efficiency (increase in energy intensity) was the main reason for the retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-2008 financial crisis, especially in high-income countries. The decomposition results of long-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that trade openness contributed to reduce carbon emission in the world and the incomes groups in the long term, although trade openness led to increase in carbon emission in developing countries in the short term. To prevent retaliatory rebound of carbon emissions, what we should learn two lessons from the decomposition of carbon emission: improving energy efficiency, and expanding trade openness. Unfortunately, energy efficiency has been neglected in the economic recovery plans to respond to COVID-19 of various countries, especially developed countries, and worse, trade protectionism is on the rise, especially in developed countries. Therefore, we are pessimistic about preventing a retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-COVID-19 for now. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. 2008 economic crisis; Coronavirus; COVID-19 pandemic; Economy recovery; Global recession Decomposition; Deterioration; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; International trade; Investments; Carbon intensity; Developed countries; Economic recovery; Energy structures; Foreign direct investments; Global financial crisis; Long-term effects; Trade protectionism; Carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; COVID-19; decomposition analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; epidemic; financial crisis; pollution tax; viral disease; Article; carbon footprint; coronavirus disease 2019; decomposition; developing country; economic aspect; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental parameters; foreign direct investment; high income country; income group; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; economic development; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Coronavirus Infections; Economic Development; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics: Ongoing global efforts The current global pandemic COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has already inflicted insurmountable damage both to the human lives and global economy. There is an immediate need for identification of effective drugs to contain the disastrous virus outbreak. Global efforts are already underway at a war footing to identify the best drug combination to address the disease. In this review, an attempt has been made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, and based on this information potential druggable targets against SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. Also, the strategies for ongoing and future drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are outlined. Given the urgency to find a definitive cure, ongoing drug repurposing efforts being carried out by various organizations are also described. The unprecedented crisis requires extraordinary efforts from the scientific community to effectively address the issue and prevent further loss of human lives and health. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.

Coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 originated from China and spread across every corner of the world. The scientific interest on COVID-19 increased after WHO declared it a pandemic in the early February of 2020. In fact, this pandemic has had a worldwide impact on economy, health, and lifestyle like no other in the last 100 years. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Coronaviridae family and causes the deadliest clinical manifestations when compared to other viruses in the family. COVID-19 is an emerging zoonotic disease that has resulted in over 383,000 deaths around the world. Scientists are scrambling for ideas to develop treatment and prevention strategies to thwart the disease condition. In this review, we have attempted to summarize the latest information on the virus, disease, prevention, and treatment strategies. The future looks promising. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2  Thinking about water and air to attain Sustainable Development Goals during times of COVID-19 Pandemic Abstract: In 2020, we are in the doorstep of a new decade, during which the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are to be achieved, collectively as one nation and one human-hood, where availability of safe, sustainable and clean water and air forms the core of multiple goals. However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe has resulted a newer challenge and paradigm for an evolving socio-scientific priorities. It is generally expected that the impacts of the pandemic would be in shorter time-scale, while the planned time and pathway for attaining the SDG are typically mandated in longer-term, hence may remain mostly unaffected. However, the stringent lockdown measures, isolated economies and financial burden to contain the pandemic emergency have resulted to slowdown of socio-economic development, which if continues for a longer period, would put a question mark on developing plans and pathways to achieve the SDGs, even in decadal-scale. Hence, in these newer times, it is important to understand the real priorities of availability of clean water and air, which are already stressed worldwide and in India, because of various natural and human-influenced triggers. This ongoing pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the impact of human development and consequent feedback of nature and human society in pre- and post-COVID scenarios on water–air–human life, which can help to re-think and re-orient the societal development priorities. It is a rare opportunity for scientists to impress the policy-makers with real-time examples on the efficacies of potential mitigation strategies for climate change, water and air pollution, and the importance of enduring investment on environmental causes and consequent benefits that can secure health and development for our future generations.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as an emerging therapeutic option for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, numerous clinical trials have been registered to examine the safety and efficacy of different types of MSCs and their exosomes for treating COVID-19 patients, with less published data on the mechanism of action. Although there is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19 as of yet, MSC therapies showed an improvement in the treatment of some COVID-19 patients. MSC’s therapeutic effect is displayed in their ability to reduce the cytokine storm, enhance alveolar fluid clearance, and promote epithelial and endothelial recovery; however, the safest and most effective route of MSC delivery remains unclear. The use of poorly characterized MSC products remains one of the most significant drawbacks of MSC-based therapy, which could theoretically promote the risk for thromboembolism. Optimizing the clinical-grade production of MSCs and establishing a consensus on registered clinical trials based on cell-product characterization and mode of delivery would aid in laying the foundation for a safe and effective therapy in COVID-19. In this review, we shed light on the mechanistic view of MSC therapeutic role based on preclinical and clinical studies on acute lung injury and ARDS; therefore, offering a unique correlation and applicability in COVID-19 patients. We further highlight the challenges and opportunities in the use of MSC-based therapy. © 2020, The Author(s).

Since the current monetary policy framework features a multi-instrument mix of liquidity tools and pricing signals, we employ a dynamic-factor modelling approach to derive a composite indicator of China's monetary policy stance. Our quantitative assessment shows that the PBoC's policy response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been swift and decisive. Specifically, our estimates reveal that the PBoC has implemented novel policy measures to ensure that commercial banks maintain liquidity access and credit provision during the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. China; Corona pandemic; COVID-19; Dynamic factor model; Monetary policy  Molecular mechanisms of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and potential anti-COVID19 pharmacological targets since the outbreak of the pandemic The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a severe threat against public health and global economies. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, is highly contagious and has led to an ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 affects, mainly, the respiratory system, with most severe cases primarily showcasing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, no targeted therapy exists, and since the number of infections and death toll keeps rising, it has become a necessity to study possible therapeutic targets. Antiviral drugs can target various stages of the viral infection, and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, both structural and non-structural proteins have been proposed as potential drug targets. This review focuses on the most researched SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their structure, function, and possible therapeutic approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic; Protein; SARS-CoV-2; Spike  Recent advances and challenges in electrochemical biosensors for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases The rise of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) as well as the increase in spread of existing infections is threatening global economies and human lives, with several countries still fighting repeated onslaught of a few of these epidemics. The catastrophic impact a pandemic has on humans and economy should serve as a reminder to be better prepared to the advent of known and unknown pathogens in the future. The goal of having a set of initiatives and procedures to tackle them is the need of the hour. Rapid detection and point-of-care (POC) analysis of pathogens causing these diseases is not only a problem entailing the scientific community but also raises challenges in tailoring appropriate treatment strategies to the healthcare sector. Among the various methods used to detect pathogens, Electrochemical Biosensor Technology is at the forefront in the development of POC devices. Electrochemical Biosensors stand in good stead due to their rapid response, high sensitivity and selectivity and ease of miniaturization to name a few advantages. This review explores the innovations in electrochemical biosensing based on the various electroanalytical techniques including voltammetry, impedance, amperometry and potentiometry and discusses their potential in diagnosis of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (Re-EIDs), which are potential pandemic threats. © 2020 Amperometry; Corona Virus; COVID-19; Impedance; Potentiometry; Voltammetry Biosensors; Diagnosis; Electroanalytical techniques; Electrochemical biosensing; Electrochemical biosensor; Emerging infectious disease; Healthcare sectors; High sensitivity; Re-emerging infectious disease; Scientific community; Diseases Receptor-binding domain-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, have posed severe threats to global public health and the economy. Treatment and prevention of these viral diseases call for the research and development of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NMAbs). Scientists have screened neutralizing antibodies using the virus receptor-binding domain (RBD) as an antigen, indicating that RBD contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, which are the main structural domains for inducing neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immune responses. This review summarizes the structure and function of RBD and RBD-specific NMAbs against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 currently under development. © 2020, The Author(s).  angiotensin converting enzyme 2; epitope; immunoglobulin G; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; virus RNA; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; protein binding; virus antibody; virus receptor; binding assay; binding site; cellular immunity; coronavirus disease 2019; crystal structure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemic; epitope mapping; follow up; gene mutation; gene sequence; human; IC50; ID50; immunization; mortality rate; nonhuman; receptor binding; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus load; virus neutralization; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; biosynthesis; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; cross reaction; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; molecular model; pandemic; pathogenicity; protein secondary structure; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; ultrastructure; virion; virology; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Epitopes; Humans; Models, Molecular; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Receptors, Virus; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Virion Living to Spend Another Day: Exploring Resilience as a New Fourth Goal of Ecological Economics The three main goals of ecological economic theory seek to predict and prevent system breakdowns. However chaos theory and human uncertainty/ignorance guarantee that shocks, breakdowns and catastrophes like COVID-19 will increasingly occur due to converging environmental resource crises. The challenge then is designing a resilient (safe-fail) economy that can endure, adapt to and successfully recover from breakdowns and avoid collapse. To date little attention has been paid in ecological economics to the implications of resilience for broader economic decisions affecting the design of global civilization. This paper provides a general introduction to resilience and an argument for why it should become a much larger focus of ecological economic research going forward. Five arguments are advanced for why resilience should not be subsumed under an existing goal, including that efforts to build resilience have the potential to both complement and contradict the other three goals, especially efficiency. The Resilience Alliance‘s adaptive cycle highlighting the cost to resilience of increasing scale and complexity meshes readily with ecological economist's own critiques of growth, encouraging increased collaboration between these transdisciplines. The need to further study these tensions provides justification for adding “Resilient Design” as a distinct fourth policy goal to core ecological economic theory. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Data acquired from 28 long-term air quality stations across the U.S. revealed widespread but nonuniform reductions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) during the first phase of lockdown (March 15–April 25, 2020) relative to a pre-lockdown reference period and historical baselines established in 2017–2019. The reductions, up to 49% for NO2 and 37% for CO, are statistically significant at two thirds of the sites and tend to increase with local population density. Significant reductions of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) only occurred in the Northeast and California/Nevada metropolises where NO2 declined the most, while the changes in ozone (O3) were mixed and relatively minor. These findings are consistent with lower transportation and utility demands that dominate NO2 and CO emissions, especially in major urban areas, due to the lockdown. This study provides an insight into potential public health benefits with more aggressive air quality management, which should be factored into strategies to reopen the U.S. and global economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It is largely unknown how the human immune system responds to this infection. A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be important to develop therapeutics against COVID-19. Here, we have used transcriptomic profile of human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells (A549) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and employed a network biology approach to generate human-virus interactome. Network topological analysis discovers 15 SARS-CoV-2 targets, which belongs to a subset of interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs (IFIT1, IFITM1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1, and OAS2) can be considered as potential candidates for drug targets in the treatments of COVID-19. We have identified significant interaction between ISGs and TLR3 agonists, like poly I: C, and imiquimod, and suggests that TLR3 agonists can be considered as a potential drug for drug repurposing in COVID-19. Our network centric analysis suggests that moderating the innate immune response is a valuable approach to target COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This disruption to the economy provided an opportunity to measure change in air pollution when the population spends more time at home with fewer trips. Hourly air pollution observations were obtained for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Ontario air monitoring network for 2020 and the previous five years. The analysis is focused on a five-week period during the SOE with a previous five-week period used as a control. Fine particulate matter did not show any significant reductions during the SOE. Ozone concentrations at 12 of the 32 monitors were lower than any of the previous five-years; however, four locations were above average. Average ozone concentrations were 1 ppb lower during the SOE, but this ranged at individual monitors from 1.5 ppb above to 4.2 ppb below long-term conditions. Nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario, and both pollutants displayed their lowest concentrations for 22 of 29 monitors. Individual monitors ranged from 1 ppb (nitrogen dioxide) and 5 ppb (nitrogen oxides) above average to 4.5 (nitrogen dioxide) and 7.1 ppb (nitrogen oxides) below average. Overall, both nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario in response to the COVID-19 SOE, ozone concentrations suggested a possible reduction, and fine particulate matter has not varied from historic concentrations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Pakistan is also severely effected by COVID-19 with 202,955 confirmed cases and total deaths of 4,118. Vector Autoregressive time series models was used to forecast new daily confirmed cases, deaths and recover cases for ten days. Our forecasted model results show maximum of 5,363/day new cases with 95% confidence interval of 3,013–8,385 on 3rd of July, 167/day deaths with 95% confidence interval of 112–233 and maximum recoveries 4,016/day with 95% confidence interval of 2,182–6,405 in the next 10 days. The findings of this research may help government and other agencies to reshape their strategies according to the forecasted situation. As the data generating process is identified in terms of time series models, then it can be updated with the arrival of new data and provide forecasted scenario in future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Confirmed cases; COVID-19; Death; Forecasting; Recoveries; Vector Autoregressive model, Time series Time series; Autoregressive time series; Confidence interval; Human lives; Model results; Modelling and forecasting; Time series models; Vector autoregressive model; Wuhan , China; Recovery Covid-19 pandemic and food: Present knowledge, risks, consumers fears and safety Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that has paralyzed social life and the economy around the world since the end of 2019, and which has so far killed nearly 600,000 people. The rapidity of its spread and the lack of detailed research on the course and methods of transmission significantly impede both its eradication and prevention. Scope and approach: Due to the high transmission rate and fatality resulting from COVID-19 disease, the paper focuses on analyzing the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 as well as its potential connection with food as a source of pathogen and infection. Key findings and conclusions: There is currently no evidence (scientific publications, WHO, EFSA etc.) that COVID-19 disease can spread directly through food and the human digestive system. However, according to the hypothesis regarding the primary transmission of the virus, the source of which was food of animal origin (meat of wild animals), as well as the fact that food is a basic necessity for humans, it is worth emphasizing that food can, if not directly, be a carrier of the virus. Particular attention should be paid to this indirect pathway when considering the potential for the spread of an epidemic and the development of prevention principles. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Food safety; Prevention; Virus transmission Animals; Digestive system; Transmissions; Viruses; Food of animal origin; High transmission rate; Primary transmission; Scientific publications; Social life; Wild animals; Diseases Predictions for COVID-19 with deep learning models of LSTM, GRU and Bi-LSTM COVID-19, responsible of infecting billions of people and economy across the globe, requires detailed study of the trend it follows to develop adequate short-term prediction models for forecasting the number of future cases. In this perspective, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths as well as managing patients. In this paper, proposed forecast models comprising autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), long shot term memory (LSTM), bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM) are assessed for time series prediction of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries in ten major countries affected due to COVID-19. The performance of models is measured by mean absolute error, root mean square error and r2_score indices. In the majority of cases, Bi-LSTM model outperforms in terms of endorsed indices. Models ranking from good performance to the lowest in entire scenarios is Bi-LSTM, LSTM, GRU, SVR and ARIMA. Bi-LSTM generates lowest MAE and RMSE values of 0.0070 and 0.0077, respectively, for deaths in China. The best r2_score value is 0.9997 for recovered cases in China. On the basis of demonstrated robustness and enhanced prediction accuracy, Bi-LSTM can be exploited for pandemic prediction for better planning and management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Bi-LSTM; Corona virus; COVID-19; Deep learning models; epidemic prediction; GRU Autoregressive moving average model; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning to rank; Mean square error; Predictive analytics; Support vector regression; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Mean absolute error; Prediction accuracy; Public health systems; Root mean square errors; Short term prediction; Support vector regression (SVR); Time series prediction; Long short-term memory Sustainability and development after COVID-19 Developing countries are highly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, in part due to the lack of international support for ensuring progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet the mounting financial burden faced by all countries means that additional support is unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future. It is critical that developing countries find innovative policy mechanisms to achieve sustainability and development aims in a cost-effective manner. This requires identifying affordable policies that can yield immediate progress towards several SDGs together and aligns economic incentives for longer term sustainable development. We identify three policies that meet these criteria: a fossil fuel subsidy swap to fund clean energy investments and dissemination of renewable energy in rural areas; reallocating irrigation subsidies to improve water supply, sanitation and wastewater infrastructure; and a tropical carbon tax, which is a levy on fossil fuels that funds natural climate solutions. Such innovative and cost-effective policy mechanisms do not require substantial external support, and they foster greater progress towards achieving the SDGs in poorer economies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Developing countries; Natural climate solutions; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals (SDGs)  Temporary reduction in fine particulate matter due to ‘anthropogenic emissions switch-off’ during COVID-19 lockdown in Indian cities The COVID-19 pandemic elicited a global response to limit associated mortality, with social distancing and lockdowns being imposed. In India, human activities were restricted from late March 2020. This ‘anthropogenic emissions switch-off’ presented an opportunity to investigate impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on ambient air quality in five Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to 2020. For each year, we isolated, analysed and compared fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data from 25 March to 11 May, to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Like other global cities, we observed substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations, from 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41–53% (Delhi), 26–54% (Hyderabad), 24–36% (Kolkata), and 10–39% (Mumbai). Generally, cities with larger traffic volumes showed greater reductions. Aerosol loading decreased by 29% (Chennai), 11% (Delhi), 4% (Kolkata), and 1% (Mumbai) against 2019 data. Health and related economic impact assessments indicated 630 prevented premature deaths during lockdown across all five cities, valued at 0.69 billion USD. Improvements in air quality may be considered a temporary lockdown benefit as revitalising the economy could reverse this trend. Regulatory bodies must closely monitor air quality levels, which currently offer a baseline for future mitigation plans. © 2020 The Author(s) Air pollution; Coronavirus pandemic; Emission switch-off; Health and economic impacts; PM2.5 concentration; SARS-CoV-2 Virus Air quality; Ambient air quality; Anthropogenic emissions; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); In-situ measurement; Mitigation measures; PM2.5 concentration; Substantial reduction; Particles (particulate matter) COVID-19 Vaccine: A comprehensive status report The current COVID-19 pandemic has urged the scientific community internationally to find answers in terms of therapeutics and vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. Published investigations mostly on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS has taught lessons on vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus. This is attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on the host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances. The COVID-19 pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after Spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted immune-potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this virus. This review is aimed at providing an overview of the efforts dedicated to an effective vaccine for this novel coronavirus which has crippled the world in terms of economy, human health and life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, many small-scale food producers faced difficulties growing, harvesting, and selling their goods. This participatory research examines local small-scale farmers’ challenges as farmers but also as consumers and their coping strategies during the month of April and one week in June 2020. The study was initiated and conceptualized in collaboration with small-scale farmer members of an existing research network in selected urban and rural areas in South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Indonesia. Participants co-designed the research, collected and uploaded data through digital survey tools, and contributed to data analysis and interpretation. A common observation across regions is that the measures imposed in response to COVID-19 highlighted and partly exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities among food system actors. Strict lockdowns in Cape Town, South Africa, and Masvingo, Zimbabwe, significantly restricted the production capacity of small-scale farmers in the informal economy and created more food insecurity for them. In Maputo, Mozambique, and Toraja and Java, Indonesia, local food systems continued to operate and were even strengthened by higher social capital and adaptive capacities. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to its fast dissemination, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020. Aiming to contain the spread of the virus, leaders of many countries restrained social movement, targeting to flatten the curve of contamination with social distancing. This review aimed to analyze how human behavior has changed throughout this period. We also approached the key components of the emotional reaction to the pandemic, how internal and external factors, such as personality traits, gender, the media, the economy and the governmental response, influence the social perception of the pandemic and the psychological outcomes of the current scenario. Moreover, we explored in depth the groups at increased risk of suffering mental health burden secondary to these circumstances. These include the healthcare professionals, elderly individuals, children, college students, black subjects, latin and LGBTQ+ communities, economically disadvantaged groups, the homeless, prisoners, the rural population and psychiatric patients. We also discussed several measures that might minimize the emotional impact derived from this scenario. It is crucial that the health authorities, the government and the population articulate to assist the vulnerable groups and promote emotional and psychological support strategies. Moreover, it is fundamental that the population is provided with accurate information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Pedrosa, Bitencourt, Fróes, Cazumbá, Campos, de Brito and Simões e Silva. behavior; COVID-19; mental health; psychological changes; restricting measures; SARS-CoV-2; social isolation  Platform and data co-operatives amidst European pandemic citizenship Many European pandemic citizens will likely be unemployed during the COVID-19 crisis. This article explores whether it is possible to alter existing data governance extractivist models to incentivize the emergence of platform and data co-operatives to protect European pandemic citizens’ labor and digital rights. As such, this article aims to decipher the rationale behind the proliferation of platform and data co-operatives by responding to how new forms of co-operatives using digital technologies can provide feasible socio-economic alternatives to improve post-COVID-19 working conditions for vulnerable or already empowered pandemic citizens. This article is structured as follows. First, the European “pandemic citizenship” term is described. Second, the rationale of this article is consequently presented. Third, the research question, two hypotheses, and the action research triangulation are described. The deployment of the triangulation methodology based on action research, mixed methods and social innovation reveals the main findings through (i) Delphi study results, (ii) a taxonomy for platform and data co-operative cases, and ultimately, (iii) fieldwork research conducted in Glasgow, Barcelona and Tallinn. This article concludes that co-operatives (platform-based or data-driven), stemming from the potential resilient response of European pandemic citizens, may currently portray a feasible alternative to data governance extractivist models. © 2020 by the author.

Food consumption and production has not only been impacted by the crisis, but it may have also contributed to causing the pandemic. After providing a brief introductory framework, the paper presents the results of a pilot study on the link between COVID-19 and the food system, as indicated by the social media activity of selected European Union (EU) Twitter accounts, measured using an original ""theme popularity"" metric. Thereafter, a systematic review of the literature is proposed to identify the causes of the rise in popularity of a sustainable food system theme, the potential consequences of the COVID-19 crisis for the food system (targeting the production, consumption and waste disposal phases) and possible solutions, focusing on the circular economy. Challenges and opportunities for policymakers in the short and long term are discussed. A holistic approach is advocated, as the global food system is intimately connected with society and requires deep cooperation among nation states and economic actors. © 2020 by the authors.

While one of the aspects of a pandemic is the loss of human life, the outbreak has multi-dimensional impacts across regional and global societies. In this paper, a comparative regressive and neural network model is developed to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) on the electricity and petroleum demand in China. The environmental analysis shows that the epidemic severeness significantly affects the electricity and the petroleum demand, both directly and indirectly. The outputs of the model stated that the elasticity of petroleum and electricity demand toward the population of the infected people is −0.1% and −0.65%, respectively. The mentioned results show that pandemic status has a significant impact on energy demand, and also its impacts can be tracked into every corner of human society. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Demand analysis; Economic impacts; Energy policy; Socio-economic analysis  Bridging the gap between social and health vulnerability in rural India: A case of COVID-19 The present study made an attempt to bridge the gap between health and social vulnerability using field survey data of five village of Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh. In-depth field survey was conducted to elicit the information of household’s perceptions’ of Covid-19. By using multistage sampling technique, a total of 150 samples were collected during February and March 2020. The study results highlights that households are highly exposed to novel Covid-19 and sensitive to inadequate access of clean water and sanitation. Households undertook a range of preventive measures including health insurance, balance diet, stored food items, consultation to doctors, self-quarantine to overcome the stress of Covid-19. The calculated livelihood vulnerability scores show that households belonging to Virjapur village are relatively highly vulnerable than others. Based on the grass root evidences, the present study suggested following measures to deal with current Covid-19 pandemic. First, a grass root awareness programme (ex-ante preventive measures) in the regional languages is pre-requisite to deal with Covid-19. Second, it is suggested that Government should immediately increase their health budget to meet the demand and supply. Third, Government should establish more medical colleges and recruit doctors in the public hospitals to ensure last person health coverage. Finally, Government come out with a grass root comprehensive plan to ensure continuous water supply. © 2020, World Research Association. All rights reserved.

In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic. Thus, it seems that the pandemic has not influenced the expectations of investors. Our results provide an insight of the response of stocks, cryptocurrencies, energy, precious metal markets, to expectations of investors in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of information ordering and sharing. © 2020 Bitcoin; Brent; COVID-19 Pandemic; Gas; Gold; Mutual information; Renyi entropy; S&P500; Silver; VIX; WTI Bitcoin; Gold; Information analysis; Investments; Silver; Energy markets; Gold and silver; Information levels; Information sharing; Information sharing network; Market expectations; Multi-scale entropies; Mutual informations; Information dissemination Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security and diet-related lifestyle behaviors: An analytical study of google trends-based query volumes The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 disease (COVID)-19 is having profound effects on the global economy and food trade. Limited data are available on how this pandemic is affecting our dietary and lifestyle-related behaviors at the global level. Google Trends was used to obtain worldwide relative search volumes (RSVs) covering a timeframe from before the COVID-19 pandemic 1 June 2019 to 27 April 2020. Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients were used to measure relationships between daily confirmed cases and aforementioned RSVs between 31 December 2019 and 15 April 2020. RSV curves showed increased interest in multiple keywords related to dietary and lifestyle behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown period in March and April 2020. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the strongest variables in each keyword category were (1) food security (food shortage: r = 0.749, food bank: r = 0.660, and free food: r = 0.555; all p < 0.001), (2) dietary behaviors (delivery: r = 0.780, restaurant: r = −0.731, take-away: r = 0.731, and food-delivery: r = 0.693; all p < 0.001), (3) outdoor-related behaviors (resort: r = −0.922, hotel: r = −0.913, cinema: r = −0.844, park: r = −0.827, fitness: r = −0.817, gym: r = −0.811; plant: r = 0.749, sunbathing: r = 0.668, and online: r = 0.670; all p < 0.001), and (4) immune-related nutrients/herbs/foods (vitamin C: r = 0.802, vitamin A: r = 0.780, zinc: r = 0.781, immune: r = 0.739, vitamin E: r = 0.707, garlic: r = 0.667, omega-3 fatty acid: r = −0.633, vitamin D: r = 0.549, and turmeric: r = 0.545; all p < 0.001). Restricted movement has affected peoples’ dietary and lifestyle behaviors as people tend to search for immune-boosting nutrients/herbs and have replaced outdoor activities with sedentary indoor behaviors. © 2020 by the authors.

As testing and tracing capacities increase, frameworks are needed to inform design and delivery to ensure their effective implementation and equitable distribution, and to strengthen community engagement in slowing and eventually stopping Covid-19 transmission. In this commentary, we highlight opportunities for integrating implementation research into planned and employed strategies in the United States to accelerate reach and effectiveness of interventions to more safely relax social distancing policies and open economies, schools, and other institutions. Implementation strategies, such as adapting evidence-based interventions based on contextual factors, promoting community engagement, and providing data audit and feedback on implementation outcomes, can support the translation of policies on testing, tracing, social distancing, and public mask use into reality. These data can demonstrate how interventions are put into practice and where adaptation in policy or practice is needed to respond to the needs of specific communities and socially vulnerable populations. Incorporating implementation research into Covid-19 policy design and translation into practice is urgently needed to mitigate the worsening health inequities in the pandemic toll and response. Applying rigorous implementation research frameworks and evaluation systems to the implementation of evidence-based interventions which are adapted to contextual factors can promote effective and equitable pandemic response and accelerate learning both among local stakeholders as well as between states to further inform their varied experiences and responses to the pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).

Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to curtail the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West African COVID-19 data project a 67% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 46% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Additionally, disease elimination is possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 5 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic cases are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 8 days, only about 29% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures triggered a 33% reduction in the time-dependent effective reproduction number between February 28 and June 26, 2020. We conclude that curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic burden significantly in West Africa requires more control measures than those that have already been implemented, as well as more mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19–24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances. This has important implications for mental health service delivery. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

As the COVID-19 pandemic gains ground in the African continent, it will create havoc and unprecedented health and economic crisis. The crisis has exposed the robustness and resilience of the economies and services such as health systems around the world and it is disaster in the making while the pandemic is spreading fast to the African continent. This is alarming mainly because the continent has weak health system compounded by low access to modern and reliable electricity. It is also anticipated that the crisis will be brought ample opportunities and the African governments and the people should make coordinated and concerted effort in developing conducive business environment and exploit the opportunities presented to facilitate energy access focusing on clean and renewable energy technologies. This is a big test for the continent and thus it will either brought prosperity through facilitating universal energy access by effectively utilizing the opportunities brought by the crisis or the lack of energy access will continue affecting communities the ability to improve their livelihoods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Challenges; COVID-19; Energy access; Opportunities  COVID-19 energy sector responses in Africa: A review of preliminary government interventions The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed unprecedented shocks across all facets of society, from strained healthcare systems to the closure of schools and economies. The energy sector is of no exception, with several concerns being raised about the ramifications that will arise for the clean energy transition. The goal of our study is to review how governments in Africa have responded to this challenge in the energy sector. We used an internet search to gather information from government policy statements/briefs, and websites of international organizations such as the IMF, WHO, KPMG, and the World Bank. Our review revealed that the majority of preliminary responses were short-term and include the provision of free electricity, waiver/suspension of bill payments, and VAT exemptions on electricity bills. These measures were more pronounced in sub-Sahara Africa while oil-rich countries of the North mostly have broad economic measures that target their oil and gas sectors. Economic stimulus packages prepared by most countries do not explicitly mention energy sector companies/institutions, especially the Renewable Energies (RE) sector. Only three countries (Nigeria, Kenya, and Burkina Faso) had specific interventions for renewables. Overall, interventions were mostly fiscal/financial and short-term, with medium to long term measures often broad without being specific to the energy sector. As governments take measures to bolster their economies, they must pay particular attention to the challenges posed by the pandemic in the energy sector and capitalize on the opportunities that it presents to drive the clean energy transition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Africa; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Energy; Energy policy; Energy transition  Circular economy in Poland: Profitability analysis for two methods of waste processing in small municipalities The problem of diminishing resources on our plant is now getting due attention from the governments as well as scientists around the world. The transition from a linear economy to a circular economy (CE) is now among the top priorities. This article discusses the implementation of the circular economy paradigm in Poland through the analysis of the existing and planned mechanisms, and actions taken by the Polish government which can be replicated by other young European countries. Further, the article discusses the direction of change and projected measures planned by the Polish government to improve the quality of municipal solid waste management. In this context, profitability analysis is carried out for two methods of waste processing (incineration and torrefaction) intended for small municipalities and settlements in which district heating and trading of generated electricity are not feasible. The results of the analysis shows that torrefaction is clearly a more desirable waste processing option as a step towards the implementation of CE for civic society in the urban context, as well as profitability, in comparison to incineration. The analysis accounts for several scenarios before the lockdown caused due to the COVID-19 pandemic and after it was lifted. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Given the detrimental impact of the pandemic on mental health and the economy, more difficult days are ahead for psychiatry. The rising public health burden of mental illnesses will inevitably exceed the capacity of psychiatric services in the United States and worldwide. The pandemic has also profoundly affected psychiatric research due to safety concerns and containment efforts. Intermediate and long-term ramifications may even be more serious. In addition to the effects of the economic downturn on available research funding, existing research tools and protocols may not meet the emerging needs in the post-COVID-19 era. This paper discusses potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter in this period from the viewpoint of workers in the field. We outline some measures that clinicians and researchers can implement to adapt to the emerging changes in psychiatry and to mitigate the forthcoming effects of the crisis. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

Although some exposed individuals have no symptoms and most symptomatic infections are not severe, COVID-19 cases span a wide spectrum, ranging from mild to critical and sometimes resulting in life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia, severe respiratory distress and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no curative drug for COVID-19 and vaccines are still under development. We are presenting here a strategy for the fast development of natural live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our proposed approach is based on screening for, identifying, analyzing and selecting naturally attenuated yet highly immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 strains, which may lead to a shorter cycle of vaccine development, as well as higher vaccine effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.

The highly contagious COVID-19 infection has affected millions of people to date and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Aside from the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of a treatment or vaccine has been the main reason for its spread. Thus, it has become necessary to find alternative methods for controlling SARS-CoV-2. For the present review, we conducted an online search for different available nutrition-based therapies for previously known coronavirus infections and RNA-based virus infections as well as general antiviral therapies. These treatments have promise for combating COVID-19, as various nutrients and minerals play direct and indirect roles in the control and prevention of this newly emerged viral infection. The patients’ nutritional status with COVID-19 must be analyzed before administering any treatment, and nutritional supplements should be given to the affected individuals along with routine treatment. We suggest a potential interventional role of nutrients to strengthen the immune system against the emerging infection caused by COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

While the sharing economy may contribute to addressing sustainability issues, its actual economic, social and environmental impacts remain poorly understood. Advancing more sustainably promising forms of sharing and leveraging its benefits, while circumventing its pitfalls, is becoming increasingly important in the era of Covid-19 and climate crisis, economic downturn and uncertainty, and loss of social connectedness, particularly in anonymous urban environments. The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, thereby supplementing more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries. The volume also outlines the course for future research. © 2020 Business perspective; Sharing economy; Sustainability; Urban governance; User perspective Environmental impact; Business perspective; Developing economies; Empirical findings; Municipal government; Production and consumption; Social and environmental impact; Sustainability issues; Urban environments; Sustainable development A Computational Approach to Identify Potential Novel Inhibitors against the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 The current pandemic threat of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, not only gives rise to a high number of deaths around the world but also has immense consequences for the worldwide health systems and global economy. Given the fact that this pandemic is still ongoing and there are currently no drugs or vaccines against this novel coronavirus available, this in silico study was conducted to identify a potential novel SARS-CoV-2-inhibitor. Two different approaches were pursued: 1) The Docking Consensus Approach (DCA) is a novel approach, which combines molecular dynamics simulations with molecular docking. 2) The Common Hits Approach (CHA) in contrast focuses on the combination of the feature information of pharmacophore modeling and the flexibility of molecular dynamics simulations. The application of both methods resulted in the identification of 10 compounds with high coronavirus inhibition potential. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In November 2019, the Global Health Security (GHS) Index was released as the first detailed assessment and benchmarking of 195 countries to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. This paper presents the first comparison of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries' performance during the pandemic, with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic preparedness as determined by the GHS Index. Using a rank-based analysis, four indices were compared between select countries, including total cases, total deaths, recovery rate, and total tests performed, all standardized for comparison. Our findings suggest a discrepancy between the GHS index rating and the actual performance of countries during this pandemic, with an overestimation of the preparedness of some countries scoring highly on the GHS index and underestimation of the preparedness of other countries with relatively lower scores on the GHS index. © 2020 Abbey et al.

Spatial agglomeration of manufacturing in the Wuhan metropolitan area: An analysis of sectoral patterns and determinants The important role of the entity economy, especially manufacturing, has been further highlighted after the outbreak of COVID-19. This study fills a research gap on manufacturing in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area by analyzing the spatio-temporal evolution patterns and characteristics of manufacturing, exploring the major location factors causing spatial reconstruction and comparing the effect intensities of the different factors in the manufacturing sector. From 2003 to 2018, the process of industrial suburbanization in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area continued to strengthen and currently the overall spatial pattern of manufacturing in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area is characterized by spreading in metropolitan areas and aggregation in industrial parks. The results of a spatial metering model showed that the dominant factors affecting the layout of manufacturing included innovation and technical service platforms, industrial parks, the number of large enterprises, living convenience, and air quality. However, the effect intensity of the different location factors varied among industries. The findings may help the government to understand the characteristics of agglomeration and spreading in the manufacturing industry and, in accordance with the dominant factors affecting the location of this industry, rationally develop ideas for adjusting the industrial layout in the post-coronavirus age. © 2020 by the authors.

Clinical management of lung cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic The rapid growth of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the early December 2019. COVID-19 spread all over the word just a few months. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection poses major threat to international health and economy. World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus was an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020. However, with the spread of COVID-19, the routine medical care of lung cancer patients was affected. Because lung cancer patients have low immunity after anti-tumor treatment, they should become the main targets for epidemic prevention. Lung cancer patients are increasingly concerned about the prevention of COVID-19. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management for lung cancer patients based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns. © 2020 The Author(s).

In light of the strategic goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030, which is to diversify Qatar’s economy and minimize its reliance on hydrocarbon industries, if these ambitious goals are to be achieved, there is a necessity to maintain the local cultural identity, demonstrated through architecture and urbanism. Design/methodology/approach: This study is an exploratory research based on qualitative methods of data gathering and investigation. The local communities who used to live in the scattered old villages were approached with surveys. At the same time, semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals in the field in Qatar and other individuals from the public, depending on their literacy levels. Findings: This paper examines how to revive those villages and improve their current economic level. Finally, the study proposes some recommendations for these abandoned villages in an attempt to rejuvenate their built heritage and revitalize their socioeconomic status. Originality/value: Economic diversification needs to be engendered through the services and products of Qatari society; this is possible by exploiting current resources such as the built heritage or historic sites in areas outside the emerging metropolitan cities. This study reveals the great potential of regenerating the old villages of the Gulf States by establishing nonprofit organizations and increasing the economic benefit of the abandoned historic structures. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology — WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology — one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations. © 2020 Covid-19; Epidemiology; Pandemic; SARSCoV-2; Sewage; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) Diagnosis; Food supply; Network security; Public health; Sewage; Chemical signatures; Clinical diagnostics; Diagnostic testing; Environmental scientists; Financial institution; Large-scale applications; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Therapeutic treatments; Diseases; COVID-19; epidemic; epidemiology; future prospect; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage; viral disease; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease surveillance; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; epidemiological monitoring; human; international cooperation; mass screening; medical research; nonhuman; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; public health; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; waste water; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; virology; virus pneumonia; waste water; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Waste Water Risk Perceptions and Psychological Effects During the Italian COVID-19 Emergency The current study provides data about the immediate risk perceptions and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among Italian participants. A sample of 980 volunteers answered a web-based survey which aimed to investigate the many facets of risk perceptions connected to COVID-19 (health, work, institutional-economy, interpersonal and psychological), and risk-related variables such as perceived knowledge, news seeking, perceived control, perceived efficacy of containment measures, and affective states. Socio-demographic characteristics were also collected. Results showed that although levels of general concern are relatively high among Italians, risk perceptions are highest with regards to the institutional-economy and work, and lowest concerning health. COVID-19 has been also estimated to be the least likely cause of death. Cognitive and affective risk-related variables contributed to explain the several risk perception domains differently. COVID-19 perceived knowledge did not affect any risk perception while the perceived control decreased health risk likelihood. The other risk-related variables amplified risk perceptions: News seeking increased work and institutional-economy risk; perceived efficacy of containment measures increased almost all perceived risks; negative affective states of fear, anger and sadness increased health risk; anxiety increased health, interpersonal and psychological risks, and uncertainty increased work, institutional-economy, interpersonal and psychological risk perceptions. Finally, positive affective states increased health risk perception. Socio-psychological implications are discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Lanciano, Graziano, Curci, Costadura and Monaco.

The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs. © Copyright © 2020 Beeraka, Sadhu, Madhunapantula, Rao Pragada, Svistunov, Nikolenko, Mikhaleva and Aliev.

In the process of fighting against the epidemic in China, the clinical value of a variety of herbal medicines has been recognized and written into the clinical application guide. However, their effective molecular mechanism and potential targets are still not clear. Pathology and pharmacology research will gradually attract attention in the post-epidemic outbreak term. Here, we constructed a COVID-19 protein microarray of potential therapy targets, which contains the main drug targets to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the anti-virus, anti-inflammatory cellar targets of the host. Series of quality controls test has been carried out, which showed that it could be applied for drug target screening of bio-active natural products.

Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines against future pathogens. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Sartorius, D’Apice, Manco and De Berardinis. antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19; emerging infectious diseases; epidemics; pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; vaccines; viruses bacterial vaccine; CD47 antigen; DNA vaccine; hemagglutinin; hepatitis B surface antigen; live vaccine; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; subunit vaccine; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; inactivated vaccine; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody response; avian influenza (H5N1); cross reaction; cytokine production; dendritic cell; dengue; Dengue virus; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; gene expression; health care personnel; hepatitis E; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; innate immunity; Lassa fever; liver injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Review; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; SARS coronavirus; vaccination; virus infection; virus neutralization; virus particle; West Nile fever; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vaccines, DNA; Vaccines, Inactivated; Vaccines, Subunit; Viral Vaccines Coronavirus RNA Proofreading: Molecular Basis and Therapeutic Targeting The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is wreaking havoc on worldwide public health and economies has heightened awareness about the lack of effective antiviral treatments for human coronaviruses (CoVs). Many current antivirals, notably nucleoside analogs (NAs), exert their effect by incorporation into viral genomes and subsequent disruption of viral replication and fidelity. The development of anti-CoV drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to proofread and remove mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and transcription. Here, we review the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading complex and evaluate its potential as a drug target. We also consider existing nucleoside analogs and novel genomic techniques as potential anti-CoV therapeutics that could be used individually or in combination to target the proofreading mechanism. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Robson et al. examine the molecular basis of the coronavirus proofreading mechanism and how this contributes to the resistance of this family of viruses to nucleoside analog (NA) antiviral drugs.

For this purpose, daily stock market returns were used over the period of December 31, 2019–April 20, 2020 for the following economies: USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, China, and Romania. The study applied the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to explore whether the Romanian stock market is impacted by the crisis generated by novel coronavirus. Granger causality was employed to investigate the causalities among COVID-19 and stock market returns, as well as between pandemic measures and several commodities. The outcomes of the ARDL approach failed to find evidence towards the impact of Chinese COVID-19 records on the Romanian financial market, neither in the short-term, nor in the long-term. On the other hand, our quantitative approach reveals a negative effect of the new deaths’ cases from Italy on the 10-year Romanian bond yield both in the short-run and long-run. The econometric research provide evidence that Romanian 10-year government bond is more sensitive to the news related to COVID-19 than the index of the Bucharest Stock Exchange. Granger causality analysis reveals causal associations between selected stock market returns and Philadelphia Gold/Silver Index. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

It has had a devastating effect around the world, not only for public health, but also for the economy, labor market, and other facets of individual and societal life. Health systems have been put under high strain, and health professionals have experienced unusual and stressful work circumstances. With the aim of drawing lessons for nursing education, the present study analyzed, during the weeks of peak infection in Spain, the stress experience and coping strategies of a sample of 403 nurses from the Spanish health system. Specifically, we analyzed how tenure, stress appraisal, problem-focused coping, and support-seeking coping predicted nurses’ awareness of their education needs, both in terms of technical-professional knowledge and skills and transversal skills. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that more tenure (years of experience) was related to lower stress appraisal (workload, −0.12, p < 0.05; insufficient preparation, −0.33, p < 0.001; and fear of contagion −0.36, p < 0.001) and more problem focused coping (PFC) strategies were related to higher awareness of professional (0.18, p < 0.01) and transversal educational needs (0.17, p < 0.01) while support seeking strategies just related to transversal training needs (0.10, p < 0.05). Moreover, the participants provided valuable input about specific contents to be considered in future nursing education programs. Implications for redesigning the nursing degree curriculum are analyzed in the discussion section. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

We need to be honest about the scale of the obstacles ahead and realise that the health challenges and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are potentially devastating. We must also prepare to make difficult ethical decisions about restarting elective hip and knee arthroplasty. These decisions should be based on the existing evidence-base, reliable data, the recommendations of experts, and regional circumstances. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus 2; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; economic; ethical challenge; healthcare; orthopaedic; revision arthroplasty; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome; total hip arthroplasty; total knee arthroplasty Austria; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; economic aspect; Editorial; elective surgery; Greece; health care personnel; hip arthroplasty; hip replacement; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; Italy; knee arthroplasty; length of stay; Netherlands; patient safety; perioperative period; periprosthetic fracture; postoperative care; prevalence; quality of life; risk factor; Spain; thromboembolism; Turkey (republic); United Kingdom; virus transmission; wellbeing; wound drainage; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care delivery; hip replacement; knee replacement; pandemic; patient selection; virus pneumonia; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Selection; Pneumonia, Viral Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): An updated review The current outbreak of novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major pandemic situation and a catastrophe for humans. COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease particularly of the respiratory system characterized by fatal complications such as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmia, kidney failure/ multiple organ failure and even death. Since its discovery, the SARS-CoV-2 has spread across 213 countries or territories, causing more than 8.5 million people with a rising death toll over 5.5 million people (as of June 2020, WHO). In fact, the current looming crisis of COVID-19 has become an increasingly serious concern to public health. It has affected lives of millions of people with severe impact on health systems and economies globally. Since there are no specific drugs and/or vaccines available so far, combating COVID-19 remains to be a major challenging task. Therefore, development of potential and effective treatment regimens (prophylactic/therapeutic) is urgently required which could resolve the issue. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the coronavirus, disease epidemiology, clinical manifestations and risk factors, replication of the virus, pathophysiology and host immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The therapeutic interventions and prophylactic measures along with precautionary measures are the frontline approaches that could be undertaken in order to control and prevent the spread of the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19 are also detailed herein. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

The SIR (susceptible–infected–recovered) model of epidemiologic analysis predicts that there should have been more cases since late March 2020 in Pakistan. We therefore sought to investigate COVID-19's prevalence and epidemiologic trends in Pakistan. Research for COVID-19 is still in its early stages, so data were collected from official websites and research journals, then analyzed for the disease's prevalence, epidemiology, mortality and recoveries. The results indicated that a rapid increase had indeed occurred in the number of COVID-19 infections in Pakistan, with the first case reported on 25 February, 2020. From 25 February 25 to April, 2020, COVID-19 infected 11,155 people in Pakistan, with 237 deaths (2.12%) and 2527 recoveries (19.96%). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 and the mortality ratio (r = 0.983, r2 = 0.966; p ≤ 0.05). We concluded that proper management must be undertaken to improve the quarantine system, and the World Health Organization guidelines must be closely followed to cope with COVID-19. There is no vaccine for COVID-19, so antiviral drugs (interferon alfa, ribavirin) may be useful to prevent COVID-19; however, severe control measures implemented in China have significantly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Suspected and confirmed cases must be treated in separate rooms. Staying home and social distancing are the safe way to proceed. © 2020 Comparison; COVID-19; Current outbreak; Epidemiology; Prevention alpha interferon; ribavirin; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; mortality rate; Pakistan; pandemic; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; public health; social distancing Lower Incidence of COVID-19 at High Altitude: Facts and Confounders Pun, Matiram, Rachel Turner, Giacomo Strapazzon, Hermann Brugger, and Erik R. Swenson. Lower incidence of COVID-19 at high altitude: Facts and confounders. High Alt Med Biol. 21:217-222, 2020. - The rapid transmission, increased morbidity, and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exhausted many health care systems and the global economy. Large variations in COVID-19 prevalence and incidence have been reported across and within many countries worldwide; however, this remains poorly understood. The variability and susceptibility across the world have been mainly attributed to differing socioeconomic status, burden of chronic diseases, access to health care, strength of health care systems, and early or late adoption of control measures. Environmental factors such as pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns at different latitudes may influence how severe the pandemic is and the incidence of infection in any part of the world. In addition, recent epidemiological data have been used to propose that altitude of residence may not only influence those environmental features considered key to lesser viral transmission, but also susceptibility to more severe forms of COVID-19 through hypoxic-hypobaria driven genomic or nongenomic adaptations specific to high-altitude populations. In this review, we critically examine these factors and attempt to determine based upon available scientific and epidemiological data whether living in high-altitude regions might be protective against COVID-19 as recent publications have claimed. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

This pandemic has affected physical health as well as mental health adversely. Several recent evidence suggests that health systems across the world have to improve their preparedness in context to infectious pandemics. The research on mental health aspects of COVID-19 and other related pandemics is lacking due to obvious reasons. This narrative review article, along with our personal views, is on various current and future mental health issues in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on various challenges and suggested solutions. The aim is also to update mental health strategies in the context of such rapidly spreading contagious illness, which can act as a resource for such a situation, currently and in future. We recommend that there is a need to facilitate mental health research to understand the psychiatric aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, include psychiatrists in the task force, and make available psychotropic and other medications with special attention to the deprived sector of the society. © 2020 Indian Journal of Psychiatry Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

In Hong Kong, where tourism is a pillar industry, the hotel industry is essential to maintaining a stable economy. Facing multiple forms of pressure, the industry's status deserves close attention. More than 200 hotels in Hong Kong were taken as the research set in this study. A Python-based web crawler was used to collect daily hotel prices from various online travel agencies. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis, and descriptive analysis were employed to study hotels' room rate fluctuations over time. Results indicated that room rates across hotels in Hong Kong were primarily influenced by holidays and festivities prior to COVID-19, whereas rates tended to decline after the outbreak. Data analysis based on hotels' star ratings revealed that 5-star hotels were relatively less affected by COVID-19 while 4- and 4.5-star hotels were most seriously affected. District-level analysis also showed that hotel room rates were differentially influenced by the virus: Hong Kong's Islands district was hit hardest, followed by Kowloon. These findings offer valuable implications for hotel managers and relevant government departments in making rational decisions based on the current market state. © 2020 by the authors.

Vaccines that induce large quantities of high affinity virus-neutralizing antibodies may optimally prevent infection and avoid unfavorable effects. Vaccination trials require precise clinical management, complemented with detailed evaluation of safety and immune responses. Here, we review the pros and cons of available vaccine platforms and options to accelerate vaccine development towards the safe immunization of the world’s population against SARS-CoV-2. Favorable vaccines, used in well-designed vaccination strategies, may be critical for limiting harm and promoting trust and a long-term return to normal public life and economy. © 2020 by the authors.

The healthcare systems of all countries and the world economy, in general, became very stressed. The extraordinary decline of activity in all spheres, except healthcare, led to a drop in the demand for transport services, including city public transport. It was important for city management to support the sustainability of the local transport system. The article presents fundamental approaches to assessing the sustainability of a transport service, particularly city passenger public transport (CPPT), for the example of the large Russian city Tyumen (size of population-nearly 807 thousand people). Methods of analysis of the sustainability of the transport process in conditions of negative environmental impact (COVID-19 pandemic) are considered. During the period from 30.03.2020 to 31.05.2020 (nine weeks-the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic) structural sustainability of the CPPT system in Tyumen kept a high level. By changing the parameters of the planned characteristics of the CPPT system state, an attempt to adapt the transport service supply to a sharp decrease in transport demand was made. In the period of ""self-isolation"", the demand for the CPPT transport service reduced more than the transport service supply. Sustainability of CPPT functioning was evaluated by calculating the elasticity of the transport supply (number of trips) in relation to the actual demand (actual volume of transportations). Calculation of the elasticity index of the CPPT system of Tyumen during nine weeks of April-May 2020 (duration of ""self-isolation"") is provided. A conclusion was made from the results of the research. In particular, it was found that the foreground target function of city management was the maintenance of a high level of transportation processes to the detriment of the transportations' effectiveness. Such a policy led to contradictory results-the additional financial expenses at the rate of 135-150 million rubles and quite a high level of contentment of the Tyumen population with the quality of the CPPT work (sociological research established that 80-85% of respondents were satisfied with the quality of the transport service in April-May 2020). © 2020 by the authors.

Our results, using both GARCH (1,1) and VAR specifications, suggest that such events are directly affecting the dry bulk and the dirty tanker segments. In addition, the results also suggest that second round effects, mostly via the decline in oil prices and, in some cases, third round effects via the impact from the stock market, also exist. Finally, by employing daily port calls a proxy variable for the demand for transportation services, we show that both the dry bulk and clean tankers are highly affected by the demand side of the economy, while vessels which transport crude oil do not register such a relationship. © 2020 The Authors Covid-19; Freight rates; Shipping markets  Air quality implications of COVID-19 in California The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected human health and the economy. The implementation of social distancing practices to combat the virus spread, however, has led to a notable improvement in air quality. This study compared the surface air quality monitoring data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)'s AirNow network during the period 20 March-5 May in 2020 to those in 2015-2019 from the Air Quality System (AQS) network over the state of California. The results indicated changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of-2.04 ± 1.57 μg m-3 and ozone of-3.07 ± 2.86 ppb. If the air quality improvements persist over a year, it could potentially lead to 3970-8900 prevented premature deaths annually (note: the estimates of prevented premature deaths have large uncertainties). Public transit demand showed dramatic declines (~80%). The pandemic provides an opportunity to exhibit how substantially human behavior could impact on air quality. To address both the pandemic and climate change issues, better strategies are needed to affect behavior, such as ensuring safer shared mobility, the higher adoption of telecommuting, automation in the freight sector, and cleaner energy transition. © 2020 by the authors.

This crisis affects people in their most important, committed, and intimate relationships. Although this crisis has damaged the health and well-being of individuals, crushed economies, and led to an extensive period of uncertainty about the future, there may also be positive outcomes in the motivation people have to protect their relationships. In this paper, we focus on strategies that therapists and relationship educators can use to help couples preserve and protect their relationships during such a time. We describe four foundations of safety that allow relationships to thrive: physical, emotional, commitment, and community. We then highlight three keys from our body of work that can help guide individuals and couples in protecting their relationships on a day-to-day and moment-to-moment basis: (1) decide, don’t slide; (2) make it safe to connect; (3) do your part. © 2020 The Authors.

The devastating impact of COVID-19 or coronavirus on the prices of commodities such as oil and gas as well as foreign exchange (Forex) trading systems and currency pairs across the nations, resulted in the collapse of businesses and shutdown of the economy. It was also accompanied with great loss of fund for investors in stock and Forex due to the consequent failure of some stock and forex software systems and strategies which were designed without envisaging the great volatility of market prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This study focuses on the examination and analysis of the performance of some Forex systems in the period of the pandemic. It identifies failed and successful systems during the period of the pandemic and proposes a pandemic surviving trading model to address the problem of the effect of unforeseen disaster such as the pandemic on trading systems. The systems examines the properties and data of failed and successful systems and integrates the best properties in the proposed model to provide a model which is likely to survive any possible future pandemic. The results show that systems developed with the property oriented pandemic surviving trading model produced a significant increase in profit during the pandemic compared to the existing system. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

The direct effects of COVID are less of a concern in children, who seem to be largely asymptomatic or to develop mild illness as occurs in high income countries; however children in LMICs constitute a high proportion of the population and may have a high prevalence of risk factors for severe lower respiratory infection such as HIV or malnutrition. Further diversion of resources from child health to address the pandemic among adults may further impact on care for children. Poor living conditions in LMICs including lack of sanitation, running water and overcrowding may facilitate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The indirect effects of the pandemic on child health are of considerable concern, including increasing poverty levels, disrupted schooling, lack of access to school feeding schemes, reduced access to health facilities and interruptions in vaccination and other child health programs. Further challenges in LMICs include the inability to implement effective public health measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene, timely identification of infected people with self-isolation and universal use of masks. Lack of adequate personal protective equipment, especially N95 masks is a key concern for health care worker protection. While continued schooling is crucial for children in LMICs, provision of safe environments is especially challenging in overcrowded resource constrained schools. The current crisis is a harsh reminder of the global inequity in health in LMICs. The pandemic highlights key challenges to the provision of health in LMICs, but also provides opportunities to strengthen child health broadly in such settings. © 2020 Child; COVID; Indirect effects; Low-middle income countries; Resource allocation child health; community living; coronavirus disease 2019; crowding (area); disease course; disease transmission; hand washing; health care access; health care facility; health care personnel; health program; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; low income country; malnutrition; middle income country; nonhuman; poverty; prevalence; priority journal; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk factor; sanitation; school; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; social isolation; treatment interruption; vaccination; Betacoronavirus; child; child health; Coronavirus infection; developing country; education; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; malnutrition; pandemic; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; water supply; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child Health; Coronavirus Infections; Crowding; Developing Countries; Education; HIV Infections; Humans; Malnutrition; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Poverty; Risk Factors; Sanitation; Water Supply Diabolical dilemmas of COVID-19: An empirical study into Dutch society’s trade-offs between health impacts and other effects of the lockdown We report and interpret preferences of a sample of the Dutch adult population for different strategies to end the so-called ‘intelligent lockdown’ which their government had put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a discrete choice experiment, we invited participants to make a series of choices between policy scenarios aimed at relaxing the lockdown, which were specified not in terms of their nature (e.g. whether or not to allow schools to re-open) but in terms of their effects along seven dimensions. These included health-related effects, but also impacts on the economy, education, and personal income. From the observed choices, we were able to infer the implicit trade-offs made by the Dutch between these policy effects. For example, we find that the average citizen, in order to avoid one fatality directly or indirectly related to COVID-19, is willing to accept a lasting lag in the educational performance of 18 children, or a lasting (>3 years) and substantial (>15%) reduction in net income of 77 households. We explore heterogeneity across individuals in terms of these trade-offs by means of latent class analysis. Our results suggest that most citizens are willing to trade-off health-related and other effects of the lockdown, implying a consequentialist ethical perspective. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the elderly, known to be at relatively high risk of being affected by the virus, are relatively reluctant to sacrifice economic pain and educational disadvantages for the younger generation, to avoid fatalities. We also identify a so-called taboo trade-off aversion amongst a substantial share of our sample, being an aversion to accept morally problematic policies that simultaneously imply higher fatality numbers and lower taxes. We explain various ways in which our results can be of value to policy makers in the context of the COVID-19 and future pandemics. Copyright: © 2020 Chorus et al.

Even if we cannot prevent dangerous viruses from emerging, we should prepare to dampen their effects on society. The current outbreak has had severe economic consequences across the globe, and it does not look like any country will be unaffected. This not only has consequences for the economy; all of society is affected, which has led to dramatic changes in how businesses act and consumers behave. This special issue is a global effort to address some of the pandemic-related issues affecting society. In total, there are 13 papers that cover different industry sectors (e.g., tourism, retail, higher education), changes in consumer behavior and businesses, ethical issues, and aspects related to employees and leadership. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.   Vaccine development against coronavirus (2003 to present): An overview, recent advances, current scenario, opportunities and challenges Background and aim: The pandemic COVID-19 occurring due to novel emerging coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is severely affecting the worldwide public health, culture, economy and human social behaviour. Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine. Method: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: In conclusion, we discuss possible clues/ target sites for designing of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus based on prior-art. © 2020 Diabetes India Adjuvants; Antigens; Coronavirus disease vaccine; COVID-19 vaccine; Spike protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Coronavirus vaccine; DNA vaccine; immunological adjuvant; inactivated vaccine; live vaccine; nanomaterial; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; virus antigen; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; animal model; Article; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug repositioning; human; infection control; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; protein subunit; SARS coronavirus; scale up; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; vaccine production; virus genome; virus mutation; virus virulence; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; immunology; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Viral Vaccines The role of digital media in shaping youth planetary health interests in the global economy Despite revolutionizing the work of practicing economists by providing a direct link between neo-classical economic theory and revealed market preference data, Random Utility Theory has yet to guide research applications in global market sustainability. With the worldwide adverse socio-economic effects of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), such application now becomes timely. Therefore, relying on a Random Utility theoretic formulation of youths' preferences for the biosphere (ecosystem services, sustainability) and science-based disease prevention to characterize their planetary health interests, this paper adopts a micro-based planetary view of markets to retrospectively analyze the health and ecological implications of digital media consumption among youths in the global economy. Empirically, we rely on a mixed bivariate ordered probit specification, which is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Our findings reveal a strong, positive correlation coefficient (0.835) between youths' interests in the biosphere and science-based disease prevention. Moreover, digital media consumption in the form of increased frequency of ecological website visits, news blogs visits, and web-browsing on broad science, significantly reduce youths' interests in the biosphere. A similar reduction in youths' interest in science-based disease prevention is observed, from news blogs visits and web-browsing on broad science. Conversely, ecological website visits appear to raise youths' interests in science-based disease prevention. Furthermore, we find a gender-based gradient in youths' planetary health interest, in favor of the female gender. Overall, our findings confirm the appropriateness of a holistic view of health, and suggests a couple of policy implications for the long-term sustainability of our planet. © 2020 by the authors.

Infectious diseases account for more than 20% of global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths. Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is having serious consequences on health and the economy worldwide. All evidence-based treatment strategies need to be considered to combat this new virus. Drugs need to be considered on scientific grounds of efficacy, safety and cost. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old drugs used in the treatment of malaria. Moreover, their antiviral properties have been previously studied, including against coronaviruses, where evidence of efficacy has been found. In the current race against time triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the search for new antivirals is very important. However, consideration should be given to old drugs with known anti-coronavirus activity, such as CQ and HCQ. These could be integrated into current treatment strategies while novel treatments are awaited, also in light of the fact that they display an anticoagulant effect that facilitates the activity of low-molecular-weight heparin, aimed at preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-associated thrombotic events. The safety of CQ and HCQ has been studied for over 50 years, however recently published data raise concerns for cardiac toxicity of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19. This review also re-examines the real information provided by some of the published alarming reports, although concluding that cardiac toxicity should in any case be stringently monitored in patients receiving CQ/HCQ. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Antiviral; Chloroquine; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2; chloroquine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glycoprotein gp 120; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; papain; papain like protease; quinone reductase 2; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone); tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anticoagulant agent; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; chloroquine; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxychloroquine; immunologic factor; anticoagulation; antiviral activity; Article; autophagy (cellular); avian influenza (H5N1); CD4+ T lymphocyte; disease severity; drug blood level; drug distribution; drug half life; drug mechanism; enzyme inhibition; human; immunomodulation; immunopathogenesis; in vitro study; in vivo study; molecular docking; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein expression; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection; trans Golgi network; virus neutralization; virus replication; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; disseminated intravascular clotting; drug effect; genetics; growth, development and aging; host pathogen interaction; immunology; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anticoagulants; Antiviral Agents; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunologic Factors; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication A scalable topical vectored vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an ongoing unprecedented global public health crises of coronavirus disease in 2019 (CoVID-19). The precipitously increased death rates, its impact on livelihood and trembling economies warrant the urgent development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which would be safe, efficacious and scalable. Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we propose a de novo synthesized avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of AOaV-1 was engineered to express full length spike (S) glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and a major protective antigen of the SARS-CoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of a recombinant vaccine candidate demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were observed in a cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly, incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-AOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagations in chicken embryonated eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics of the recombinant. Taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human, and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against CoVID-19 for clinical studies. © 2020 by the authors.

Several models are under study to control the disease spread and infection rate and to detect possible factors that might favour them, with a focus on understanding the correlation between the disease and specific geophysical parameters. However, the pandemic does not present evident environmental hindrances in the infected countries. Nevertheless, a lower rate of infections has been observed in some countries, which might be related to particular population and climatic conditions. In this paper, infection rate of COVID-19 is modelled globally at a 0.5∘ resolution, using a Maximum Entropy-based Ecological Niche Model that identifies geographical areas potentially subject to a high infection rate. The model identifies locations that could favour infection rate due to their particular geophysical (surface air temperature, precipitation, and elevation) and human-related characteristics (CO2 and population density). It was trained by facilitating data from Italian provinces that have reported a high infection rate and subsequently tested using datasets from World countries’ reports. Based on this model, a risk index was calculated to identify the potential World countries and regions that have a high risk of disease increment. The distribution outputs foresee a high infection rate in many locations where real-world disease outbreaks have occurred, e.g. the Hubei province in China, and reports a high risk of disease increment in most World countries which have reported significant outbreaks (e.g. Western U.S.A.). Overall, the results suggest that a complex combination of the selected parameters might be of integral importance to understand the propagation of COVID-19 among human populations, particularly in Europe. The model and the data were distributed through Open-science Web services to maximise opportunities for re-usability regarding new data and new diseases, and also to enhance the transparency of the approach and results. © 2020 The Author(s) Coronavirus; COVID-19; Ecological niche modelling; Maximum entropy; SARS-CoV-2 Disease control; Distributed database systems; Ecology; Geophysics; Health risks; Population statistics; Web services; Climatic conditions; Ecological niche modeling; Geographical area; Geophysical parameters; Monitoring strategy; Population densities; Rate of infections; Surface air temperatures; Diseases; climate conditions; data set; disease spread; ecological modeling; global change; human activity; infectious disease; niche; population outbreak; prediction; virus; China; Europe; Hubei; United States; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus The antiviral, anti-inflammatory effects of natural medicinal herbs and mushrooms and SARS-CoV-2 infection The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, producing the disease COVID-19 is a pathogenic virus that targets mostly the human respiratory system and also other organs. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, however there have been previous outbreaks of different versions of the beta coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV1) from 2002 to 2003 and the most recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. All of the above have been recognised as major pathogens that are a great threat to public health and global economies. Currently, no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified; however, certain drugs have shown apparent efficacy in viral inhibition of the disease. Natural substances such as herbs and mushrooms have previously demonstrated both great antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, the possibilities of natural substances as effective treatments against COVID-19 may seem promising. One of the potential candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be Inonotus obliquus (IO), also known as chaga mushroom. IO commonly grows in Asia, Europe and North America and is widely used as a raw material in various medical conditions. In this review, we have evaluated the most effective herbs and mushrooms, in terms of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects which have been assessed in laboratory conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

The crisis of care, I contend, is fundamentally a political and an ethical crisis. In this short commentary, I outline the structural (i.e., systemic) and reproductive (i.e., labour) character of this crisis, using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example. From here, I argue for the imperative to centre an expansive conception of care in critical community psychology work. Specifically, I posit that by working with and alongside activist care workers, community psychologists can assist in building socially just modalities of care. After reflecting on my work with collective caring initiatives, I offer five (tentative) guiding principles for a community psychology that is committed to addressing the crisis of care, namely: (1) commitment to building political coalitions; (2) commitment to refuting capitalist conceptions of care; (3) commitment to expanding conceptions of care; (4) commitment to embracing the psychological consequences of care work; and (5) a politicoethical commitment. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC activism; care; COVID-19; reproductive labour; social movements Coronavirus infection; demography; health care delivery; health care personnel; human; pandemic; politics; psychology; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Politics; Psychology, Applied; Residence Characteristics Genotyping coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: methods and implications The emerging global infectious COVID-19 disease by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late December 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. 2019-nCoV; COVID-19; Genotyping; SARS-CoV-2; Single-nucleotide polymorphism nucleoprotein; protein RNA primase; RNA polymerase; unclassified drug; viral protein; vitronectin; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; epidemic; gene isolation; gene location; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic variation; genotype; human; infection control; nonhuman; pathogenicity; priority journal; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single nucleotide polymorphism; vaccine production; virus isolation; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; genomics; genotyping technique; molecular evolution; mutation; pandemic; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; virus genome; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Viral; Genomics; Genotyping Techniques; Humans; Mutation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Alignment Plants-derived biomolecules as potent antiviral phytomedicines: New insights on ethnobotanical evidences against coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is in focus over all known human diseases, because it is destroying the world economy and social life, with increased mortality rate each day. To date, there is no specific medicine or vaccine available against this pandemic disease. However, the presence of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules with antiviral properties might also be a successful strategy in order to develop therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this review will summarize the available literature and other information/data sources related to antiviral medicinal plants, with possible ethnobotanical evidence in correlation with coronaviruses. The identification of novel antiviral compounds is of critical significance, and medicinal plant based natural compounds are a good source for such discoveries. In depth search and analysis revealed several medicinal plants with excellent efficacy against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which are well-known to act on ACE-2 receptor, 3CLpro and other viral protein targets. In this review, we have consolidated the data of several medicinal plants and their natural bioactive metabolites, which have promising antiviral activities against coronaviruses with detailed modes of action/mechanism. It is concluded that this review will be useful for researchers worldwide and highly recommended for the development of naturally safe and effective therapeutic drugs/agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be used in therapeutic protocols alone or in combination with chemically synthetized drugs. © 2020, MDPI AG.

The COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be an enormous challenge to the health of the world population with tremendous consequences for the world economy. New knowledge about COVID-19 is being acquired continuously. Although the main manifestation of COVID-19 is SARS, dysfunction in other organs has been described in the last months. Neurological aspects of COVID-19 are still an underreported subject. However, a plethora of previous studies has shown that human CoVs might be neurotropic, neuroinvasive, and neurovirulent, highlighting the importance of this knowledge by physicians. Besides, several neurological manifestations had been described as complications of two other previous outbreaks of CoV diseases (SARS ad Middle East respiratory syndrome). Therefore, we should be watchful, searching for early evidence of neurological insults and promoting clinical protocols to investigate them. Our objectives are to review the potential neuropathogenesis of this new CoV and the neurological profile of COVID-19 patients described so far. © 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene  immunoglobulin; cerebrovascular accident; coronavirus disease 2019; cranial neuropathy; frontal lobe; Guillain Barre syndrome; human; necrotizing encephalopathy; nervous system; neurologic disease; neuropathology; nonhuman; respiratory virus; Review; SARS coronavirus; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smelling disorder; taste disorder; thrombosis; virus entry; virus genome; virus morphology; virus particle; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the novel coronavirus among Bangladeshis: Implications for mitigation measures The current novel coronavirus (nCoV) pandemic, COVID-19, was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally, causing startling loss of life, stalling the global economy, and disrupting social life. One of the challenges to contain COVID-19 is convincing people to adopt personal hygiene, social distancing, and self-quarantine practices that are related to knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the residents of respective countries. Bangladesh, a densely populated country with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may help policy makers produce informed decisions. This study assessed KAP in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1,837 responses across Bangladesh. Ultimately, 1,589 completed responses were included in a statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores and their interrelations with sociodemographic variables. The overall KAP was poor, with only 33% of the participants demonstrating good knowledge, whereas 52.4% and 44.8% of the subjects showed good attitudes and practices, respectively. Sociodemographic factors had strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP scores were evident in females over males, among aged 45 years and older over younger participants, and among retired workers and homemakers over students and public service employees. This study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to foster public confidence and ensure more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures. This study provides a KAP baseline regarding COVID-19 among Bangladeshis. © 2020 Paul et al.

Based on in-depth interviews with supply chain professionals and grounded theory approach, we constructed a framework of global sourcing improvement to support better utilization of lean, agile, and leagile strategies, which we believe can help the supply chains worldwide to act better, especially in various difficult conditions and sustain their business accordingly. Our proposed framework also contributes to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, since the core concept of the framework is to establish a new organization under the umbrella of the UN to improve the global sourcing and consequently the usage of supply chain strategies accordingly. The applicative part of the paper reveals characteristics of new developed framework, ranging from its purpose and aims, structure, key processes, functions, and its financing. Along with validation of the framework are presented benefits for society, industry, and global economy. Additionally, the paper also reviews the impact of the current health and economic crisis caused by COVID 19, on usage of the three supply chain strategies namely; lean, agility, and leagility to see how they can work in the difficult time, as COVID 19. © 2020 by the authors.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to formulate interventions that will help control their spread and impact when they emerge. The education of young girls and women is one such historical approach. They are usually the vulnerable targets of disease outbreaks – they are most likely to be vehicles for the spread of epidemics due to their assigned traditional roles in resource-limited countries. Based on our work and the work of others on educational interventions, we propose six critical components of a cost-effective and sustainable response to promote girl-child education in resource-limited settings. © 2020, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine Inc.

From this perspective, plasmonic-based biosensing can manage the threat of infectious diseases by providing timely virus monitoring. In recent years, many plasmonics’ platforms have embraced the challenge of offering on-site strategies to complement traditional diagnostic methods relying on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This review compiled recent progress on the development of novel plasmonic sensing schemes for the effective control of virus-related diseases. A special focus was set on the utilization of plasmonic nanostructures in combination with other detection formats involving colorimetric, fluorescence, luminescence, or Raman scattering enhancement. The quantification of different viruses (e.g., hepatitis virus, influenza virus, norovirus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus) with particular attention to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reviewed from the perspective of the biomarker and the biological receptor immobilized on the sensor chip. Technological limitations including selectivity, stability, and monitoring in biological matrices were also reviewed for different plasmonic-sensing approaches. © 2020 by the author.

Based upon current researches, this virus is spreading from one human to another through respiratory droplets, i.e. cough and sneeze. Till now, there has not been any specific treatment found for this virus. Hence, there is a critical need to discover alternative techniques to cope with the current scenario. Recent Findings: This review conducted an online search for prevention of coronavirus infection with the help of nutritional interventions. It has been observed that the effect of the virus is mostly on the individual with low immunity, individual affected with diseases like diabetes, and individual using any immune-suppressed drug or having past history of major surgeries or severe medical conditions. Summary: Therefore, consuming foods which boost immunity helps in preventing respiratory-related disorder or suppressing diseases-related problems, which could be helpful in controlling the spread of this virus. In conclusion, it has been suggested that before the beginning of generalised treatments and interventions in each infected patient, nutritional status should be evaluated, as it can help in creating a specific nutrition intervention for the infected individual. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Now in the 21st century in the post‐antibiotic era, the miracle is turning into a nightmare, due to the growing problem of the resistance of microorganisms to classic antimicrobials and the non‐investment by the pharmaceutical industry in new antimicrobial agents. Unfortunately, the current COVID‐19 pandemic has demonstrated the global risks associated with uncontrolled infections and the various forms of impact that such a pandemic may have on the economy and on social habits besides the associated morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to recycle classic antibiotics, as is the case in the use of ionic liquids (ILs) based on antibiotics. Thus, the aim of the present review is to summarize the data on ILs, mainly those with antimicrobial action and especially against resistant strains. The main conclusions of this article are that ILs are flexible due to their ability to modulate cations and anions as a salt, making it possible to combine the properties of both and multiplying the activity of separate cations and anions. Also, these compounds have low cost methods of production, which makes it highly attractive to explore them, especially as antimicrobial agents and against resistant strains. ILs may further be combined with other therapeutic strategies, such as phage or lysine therapy, enhancing the therapeutic arsenal needed to fight this worldwide problem of antibacterial resistance. Thus, the use of ILs as antibiotics by themselves or together with phage therapy and lysine therapy are promising alternatives against pathogenic microorganisms, and may have the possibility to be used in new ways in order to restrain uncontrolled infections. © 2020 by the authors.

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, is even more devastating in terms of patient mortality. At the time of this writing, the nanoscopic SARS-Cov-2 virus has paralyzed the world economy and resulted in what are likely permanent changes in our expectations of society and daily life. New technology is needed to reduce the economic and social impacts of diseases such as COVID-19 and prevent additional negative consequences resulting from subsequent pandemics. As viruses such as Influenza A and SARS-Cov-2 are transmitted from person to person by exposure to infected secretions, inexpensive at-home or workplace tests for the analysis of the virus content within those secretions, such as saliva or mucus from the nasopharynx (as in a swab-based test) or oropharynx (as in a saliva-based test), will be critical for a safe return to work, school, and cultural activities. The most reliable approaches for viral sensing are polymerase chain reaction and protein detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; however, these approaches require extensive sample handling, laboratory infrastructure, and long sample-to-result time. Advances are leading to increased point-of-care capability for these testing methods, but even this effort is insufficient for curbing the impact of the current pandemic. There are many options for alternative virus (or antigen) detection currently in development. These novel approaches are more amenable for testing in home or workplace without specialized equipment and training and include measurements of mass changes, heat of adsorption, electrochemical changes, changes in optical properties, and changes in electronic properties. Of these transduction mechanisms, electronic property measurements of materials as they interact with virus-containing secretions offer the greatest potential for simplicity, selectivity, and sensitivity needed to revolutionize traditional laboratory assays for at-home pathogen detection. We have, therefore, focused this review on the operation and architecture of electronic antigen sensors, specifically those demonstrating a change in electrical conductivity when interacting with a specific antigen, with hopes that a brief summary of over five decades of research in this area will be beneficial to those developing alternative, user-friendly routes for detection of viruses at this or any time. A key element in electronic virus sensing with useful sensitivity is the use of nanomaterials with ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratios, maximizing the change in charge carrier density upon adsorption events. So-called ""low-dimensional materials""are materials characterized by nanoscopic length scales in at least one dimension. One-dimensional nanomaterials such as nanowires and nanotubes are well-established as effective sensing materials with potential for high sensitivity; however, their realization on a large scale has been challenging. Two-dimensional materials are planar materials with thicknesses of one or a few molecular layers and represent the ultimate limit of the surface-to-volume ratio with promising demonstrations of large-scale production and sensitive, selective virus sensing with many options for functionalization. All aspects of 2D sensor fabrication, functionalization, and use are addressed. © 2020 Author(s).

Because approved drugs and vaccines are limited or not available, new options for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are in high demand. To identify SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, we analyzed the antibody response of 12 COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days after diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early as 8 days after diagnosis. Of these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC100 as low as 0.04 μg/mL, showing a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and low levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursor sequences were identified in naive B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals who were sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are readily generated from a diverse pool of precursors, fostering hope for rapid induction of a protective immune response upon vaccination. © 2020 The Author(s)In a longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected people, Kreer et al. find highly potent neutralizing antibodies that use a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and show low levels of somatic mutations. They also identify potential precursor sequences of these SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies from virus-naive individuals, sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. This could indicate that neutralizing antibodies can be readily generated from existing germline antibody sequences found in the general population. © 2020 The Author(s) 2019-nCoV; COVID-19; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2; single B cell analysis immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G1 antibody; neutralizing antibody; vitronectin; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; adult; antibody isolation; antibody response; antigen binding; Article; B lymphocyte; cell screening; cell selection; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; gene sequence; human; human cell; longitudinal study; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; somatic mutation; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; immunoglobulin variable region; immunological memory; immunology; isolation and purification; pandemic; somatic hypermutation; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; B-Lymphocytes; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunoglobulin Variable Region; Immunologic Memory; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin Potent neutralizing antibodies against multiple epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues, with devasting consequences for human lives and the global economy1,2. The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of sixty-one SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to hospital with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng ml−1. Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, ‘all RBD-down’ conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.  neutralizing antibody; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; immunoglobulin F(ab) fragment; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; antibody; concentration (composition); global economy; inhibition; reconstruction; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus; amino terminal sequence; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cryoelectron microscopy; hospital admission; human; immunogenicity; in vitro study; inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; priority journal; protein conformation; protein domain; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus isolation; virus spike; animal; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; disease model; epitope mapping; female; immunology; lung; male; Mesocricetus; molecular model; pandemic; pathology; serodiagnosis; ultrastructure; virology; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Disease Models, Animal; Epitope Mapping; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments; Lung; Male; Mesocricetus; Models, Molecular; Neutralization Tests; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology locally and globally: Feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods. © 2020 The Authors Coronavirus; Global health; Modeling; Wastewater-based epidemiology Computational methods; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Population statistics; Travel time; Computational analysis; Global economics; Local conditions; Medical screening; Orders of magnitude; Population sizes; Specific location; Two-step process; Monitoring; COVID-19; epidemiology; infectious disease; respiratory disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; temperature effect; wastewater; Article; clinical evaluation; computer simulation; coronavirus disease 2019; cost control; disease surveillance; feasibility study; geographic distribution; global health; human; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; pandemic; population size; priority journal; resource management; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; waste water; wastewater based epidemiology; water temperature; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; Louisiana; New York; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Detroit; Hubei; Iran; Italy; Lombardy; Louisiana; Madrid [Spain]; Michigan; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; New Orleans; New York [United States]; Seattle; Spain; Tehran [Iran]; United States; Washington [United States]; Wuhan; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Feasibility Studies; Humans; New Orleans; New York City; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a large impact on global health, travel, and economy. Therefore, preventative and therapeutic measures are urgently needed. Here, we isolated monoclonal antibodies from three convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using a SARS-CoV-2 stabilized prefusion spike protein. These antibodies had low levels of somatic hypermutation and showed a strong enrichment in VH1-69, VH3-30-3, and VH1-24 gene usage. A subset of the antibodies was able to potently inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection at a concentration as low as 0.007 micrograms per milliliter. Competition and electron microscopy studies illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains multiple distinct antigenic sites, including several receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes as well as non-RBD epitopes. In addition to providing guidance for vaccine design, the antibodies described here are promising candidates for COVID-19 treatment and prevention. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

While, on one hand, medical institutions are critically attempting to find a cure, on the other hand, governments have introduced striking measures and policies to curtail the rapid spread of the disease. Although COVID-19 has achieved pandemic status and is predominantly viewed as a biomedical issue, it is argued that it should also be treated as a psychological crisis. This paper also reviews the literature to examine and comment on the detrimental effects of isolation, which has been enforced as one of the primary preventative measures to manage the spread of COVID-19. This paper further outlines key recommendations that should be addressed across different levels to buffer against the known adverse effects of isolation, which is especially relevant for the current COVID-19 situation, where a large proportion of the global population is isolated, confined, and/or quarantined. © Copyright © 2020 Roychowdhury. 2019 novel coronavirus disease; coronavirus; crisis; health; isolation; psychology; recommendations; wellbeing  An Alphavirus-derived replicon RNA vaccine induces SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in mice and nonhuman primates The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is having a deleterious impact on health services and the global economy, highlighting the urgent need for an effective vaccine. Such a vaccine would need to rapidly confer protection after one or two doses and would need to be manufactured using components suitable for scale up. Here, we developed an Alphavirus-derived replicon RNA vaccine candidate, repRNA-CoV2S, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The RNA replicons were formulated with lipid inorganic nanoparticles (LIONs) that were designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery, and immunogenicity. We show that a single intramuscular injection of the LION/repRNA-CoV2S vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti–SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a type 1 T helper cell response. A prime/boost regimen induced potent T cell responses in mice including antigen-specific responses in the lung and spleen. Prime-only immunization of aged (17 months old) mice induced smaller immune responses compared to young mice, but this difference was abrogated by booster immunization. In nonhuman primates, prime-only immunization in one intramuscular injection site or prime/boost immunizations in five intramuscular injection sites elicited modest T cell responses and robust antibody responses. The antibody responses persisted for at least 70 days and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at titers comparable to those in human serum samples collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19. These data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved.

Since the beginning of 2020, this stability has been undergoing one of the most vigorous pressure tests ever due to the COVID-19 outbreak. From a mere health issue, the pandemic has turned into an economic threat to food security globally in the forms of lockdowns, economic decline, food trade restrictions, and rising food inflation. It is safe to assume that the novel health crisis has badly struck the least developed and developing economies, where people are particularly vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition. However, due to the recency of the COVID-19 problem, the impacts of macroeconomic fluctuations on food insecurity have remained scantily explored. In this study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing interactions between the food security status of people and the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, food trade, food inflation, and currency volatilities. The study was performed in the cases of 45 developing economies distributed to three groups by the level of income. The consecutive application of the autoregressive distributed lag method, Yamamoto’s causality test, and variance decomposition analysis allowed the authors to find the food insecurity effects of COVID-19 to be more perceptible in upper-middle-income economies than in the least developed countries. In the latter, food security risks attributed to the emergence of the health crisis were mainly related to economic access to adequate food supply (food inflation), whereas in higher-income developing economies, availability-sided food security risks (food trade restrictions and currency depreciation) were more prevalent. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip decision-makers with up-to-date estimations of health crisis effects on economic parameters of food availability and access to staples in food-insecure communities. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper quantitatively assesses the potential of government investments in eco-friendly construction projects to boost the economy and simultaneously realise environmental gains through reduced energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis uses a Computable General Equilibrium model that examines the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis in a small open economy (Belgium). Subsequently, the impact of the proposed policy is assessed through comparative analysis for macroeconomic parameters as well as CO2 equivalent emissions for four scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic damages economies considerably, however, the reduction in emissions is less than proportionate. Still, well-designed public policies can reverse this trend, achieving both economic growth and a disproportionally large decrease in emissions. Moreover, the positive effect of such a decoupling policy on GDP is even stronger during the pandemic than compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This is the result of a targeted, investment-induced green transition towards low energy-intensive economic activities. Finally, this paper describes how the net effect on the government budget is positive through the indirect gains of the economic uptake. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

This disease has hugely affected healthcare systems as well as the economy to an extent never seen before. To date, COVID-19 infection has led to about 165000 deaths in 150 countries. At present, there is no specific drug or efficient treatment for this disease. In this analysis based on evidential relationships of the biological characteristics of MSCs, especially umbilical cord (UC)-derived MSCs as well as the first clinical trial using MSCs for COVID-19 treatment, we discuss the use of UC-MSCs to improve the symptoms of COVID-19 in patients. ©The Author(s) 2020.

Unfortunately, there is not currently available vaccine for SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19. Various types of patients have delayed treatment or even routine check-ups and we are adapting to a virtual world. In many cases, surgeries are delayed unless they are essential. This is also true with regards to cancer treatments and screening. Interestingly, some existing drugs and nutraceuticals have been screened for their effects on COVID-19. Certain FDA approved drugs, vitamin, natural products and trace minerals may be repurposed to treat or improve the prevention of COVID-19 infections and disease progression. This review article will summarize how the treatments of various cancer patients has changed during the COVID-19 era as well as discuss the promise of some existing drugs and other agents to be repurposed to treat this disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Cancer; COVID-19; Natural products; Nutraceuticals; Repurposing approved drugs angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antineoplastic agent; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxychloroquine; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; trace element; vitamin; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; immunology; neoplasm; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; virology; virus pneumonia; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Trace Elements; Vitamins COVID-19: Drug development and kidney related problems Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious disease affecting almost every country in the world. This disease makes some problems in the health system, society, politics, and economy. Several reports showed that mortality in COVID-19 patients was related to abnormal kidney function. This condition should be considered to prevent death. Some investigational drugs are on the way in the preclinical and clinical trials. Some of them no have a study for safety in the kidney especially in chronic kidney disease patients including those who undergo hemodialysis. Some give a satisfying effect. Understanding COVID-19, kidney diseases, and drugs will help us to get the most potent treatment. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.

In order to understand how each country is impacted by the virus compared with what would have been expected prior to the pandemic and the mortality risk on a global scale, a multi-factor weighted spatial analysis is presented. Method: A number of key developmental indicators across three main categories of demographics, economy, and health infrastructure were used, supplemented with a range of dynamic indicators associated with COVID-19 as independent variables. Using normalised COVID-19 mortality on 13 May 2020 as a dependent variable, a linear regression (N = 153 countries) was performed to assess the predictive power of the various indicators. Results: The results of the assessment show that when in combination, dynamic and static indicators have higher predictive power to explain risk variation in COVID-19 mortality compared with static indicators alone. Furthermore, as of 13 May 2020 most countries were at a similar or lower risk level than what would have been expected pre-COVID, with only 44/153 countries experiencing a more than 20% increase in mortality risk. The ratio of elderly emerges as a strong predictor but it would be worthwhile to consider it in light of the family makeup of individual countries. Conclusion: In conclusion, future avenues of data acquisition related to COVID-19 are suggested. The paper concludes by discussing the ability of various factors to explain COVID-19 mortality risk. The ratio of elderly in combination with the dynamic variables associated with COVID-19 emerge as more significant risk predictors in comparison to socio-economic and demographic indicators. © 2020 by the authors.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sorely testing health care systems and economies around the world and is rightly considered as the major health emergency in a century. Despite the course of the disease appearing to be mild in many cases, a significant proportion of symptomatic patients develop pneumonia requiring hospitalisation or progress to manifest respiratory complications leading to intensive care treatment. Potential interventions for SARS-CoV2-associated pneumonia are being tested, some of which holding promise, but as of today none of these has yet demonstrated outstanding efficacy in treating COVID-19. In this article, we discuss fresh perspectives and insights into the potential role of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 as well as similarities with systemic inflammatory response in sepsis and the rationale for exploring novel treatment options affecting host immune response. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Governments at all levels in this nation responded. This analysis starts with a basic question: How did prior planning for pandemics shape responses? A second question emerges: why were data systems inadequate? Expectations, policies, and procedures focused on addressing influenza pandemics shaped responses to COVID-19. Crippled by inadequate data, federal experts did not fully understand likely impacts of COVID-19 until early March. Planned public health processes were overwhelmed by a surge in infections and deaths. Decision making planned to be responses by experts moved to elected officials. Needed data were provided by sources outside government. Governors in 42 states issued stay-at-home orders, causing severe dislocations in the economy and society at a scale never experienced before as the result of deliberate public policy choices. Possible improvements for the future are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

The trade in wild meat, and its role in diets, have been brought into focus as a consequence of discussions over the origins of COVID-19. As a result, there have been calls for the closure of China’s “wet markets”; greater scrutiny of the wildlife trade in general; and a spotlight has been placed on the potential risks posed by growing human populations and shrinking natural habitats for animal to human transmission of zoonotic diseases. However, to date there has been little attention given to what the consequences of the COVID-19 economic shock may be for the wildlife trade; the people who rely on it for their livelihoods; and the wildlife that is exploited. In this policy perspective, we argue that the links between the COVID-19 pandemic, rural livelihoods and wildlife are likely to be more complex, more nuanced, and more far-reaching, than is represented in the literature to date. We develop a causal model that tracks the likely implications for the wild meat trade of the systemic crisis triggered by COVID-19. We focus on the resulting economic shockwave, as manifested in the collapse in global demand for commodities such as oil, and international tourism services, and what this may mean for local African economies and livelihoods. We trace the shockwave through to the consequences for the use of, and demand for, wild meats as households respond to these changes. We suggest that understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of wild meat use requires increased collaboration between environmental and resource economics and the ecological and conservation sciences. © 2020, The Author(s).

A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. Results: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures. © 2020 by the authors.

By using multistage sampling technique, 150 samples were collected during March- April 2020. Data highlight that households are highly exposed to novel Covid-19, and also equally sensitive to inadequate and poor availability and accessibility of clean water, sanitation and health care system. Data suggest a grass root awareness program (ex-ante preventive measures) in the regional languages; increase public health budget to meet the demand and improve the supply chain; establishment of more physical and human infrastructure in long run; comprehensive plan to ensure continuous water supply in the rural areas. © 2020 The Author(s) Covid-19; Health vulnerability; Livelihood vulnerability; Regional inequalities; Rural economy  Supply Chain Manipulation, Misrepresentation, and Magical Thinking During the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has placed remarkable stress on all aspects of society, from health care and the economy to the psychological well-being of communities. While the crisis is still playing out in the United States and around the world, it is nevertheless appropriate to begin to assess its impact. This article asks: What documentable public failures provide a deeper understanding of the U.S. government COVID-19 responses’ impact on supply chains? Case examples show that markets were adversely affected in ways that caused avoidable shortages of critical goods and supplies. Moreover, public procurement effectiveness was likely reduced by short-run efforts to obtain political advantage. The article begins with a brief review of disaster procurement, highlighting how public procurement professionals tried to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next section delineates three politically led phenomena that adversely impacted procurement’s ability to acquire the needed goods and services, including a lack of cohesive strategy in acquiring essential personal protective equipment; preference for unproven drugs and magical thinking; and cozy relationships between the public and private sectors. The article concludes by discussing the centrality of public sector procurement professionals as a critical link for effective provision of government services, especially in times of crisis. © The Author(s) 2020.

It seems unavoidable that this natural disruption has hit the global economy and produced a huge crisis for firms. This study explores how firms in China are innovating their marketing strategies by critically identifying the typology of firms’ marketing innovations using two dimensions, namely, motivation for innovations and the level of collaborative innovations. This research also explores the influence of the external environment, internal advantages (e.g., dynamic capabilities and resource dependence), and characteristics of firms on Chinese firms’ choice and implementation of marketing innovation strategies. It provides valuable insights for firms to respond successfully to similar crisis events in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

COVID-19 is one of the most serious infectious disease threats in the past 100 years. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that early diagnosis of infectious COVID-19 cases is of great help to slow down the spread of disease and reduce mortality. Therefore, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of great significance in the control of the pandemic. However, because patients with COVID-19 show partially similar symptoms to diseases such as influenza-like illness, it is impossible to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection by relying solely on the patient's clinical features. Meanwhile, there are a number of asymptomatic patients, who are capable of spreading the infection while passing general surveillance. The early diagnosis of such cases is also critical for the prevention of the outbreak and control of the pandemic. Given there is no effective SARS-CoV-2-specific anti-viral agents, chemists are engaging in the development of analytical strategies for the SARS-CoV-2 detection and antiviral drug to combat the spread of the COVID-19. In order to support the innovation in the ongoing research on fighting COVID-19 pandemic, we summarized part of the achievements in SARS-CoV-2 detection and drug development engaged by chemists in China. By summarizing the available products and patents with practical potentials in fast analysis, we discussed the recent advances in the techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their application potentials in diagnosis of COVID-19. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, the most specific analysis method is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based nucleic acid assay. At the end of March, National Medical Products Administration has approved more than 20 products aiming at SARS-CoV-2 test, most of which are kits based on the principle of real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Because PCR-based method needs complex manual operation steps, the technique is limited due to the time-consuming reaction steps. Later on, techniques with multiple procedures including nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and virus detection have been integrated for rapid detection. In order to solve the problems caused by disadvantages of complex thermal cycling process in PCR, isothermal amplification has been applied for nucleic acid detection. Combined with isothermal amplification, rapid point-of-care test is applicable for the detection of collected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Although viral RNA assay is the most specific method for diagnosis of COVID-19, it cannot be used to determine the post-infection or monitor the immunity of general populations. The immunological assays could be applied for the detection of antibodies themselves several days after the infection by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, and other technologies have successfully applied for the immune assay. Some reagents, detection kits, and devices have been certificated and marketed internationally. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents have been designed and tested. Moreover, several small-molecule drug candidates with high efficacy and low toxicity showed great potential in clinical application. Facing the outbreak of epidemic of COVID-19, Department of Chemical Sciences, Department of Mathematical and Physical Sciences of National Natural Science Foundation of China have jointly funded three innovative projects to support the research on the effective and expedite control of the epidemic. These projects include ""Research on rapid detection of new coronavirus in aerosol on site"", ""A pre-clinical study of using small molecules to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced excessive inflammation and injury"", and ""Polymer micro-/nano-fibrous non-woven fabrics prepared via flash-pressure- released technology and reusable high-quality medical protective suits produced with these fabrics"". The pandemic of COVID-19 is a major public health emergency, which poses a major challenge to health system worldwide and also has a major impact on economy and society. In response to sudden large-scale outbreaks, rapid, accurate and high-throughput detection technology is undoubtedly the priority of ""anti-epidemic"". Focusing on the present and serving the long-term requirement, we still need to innovatively propose new ideas to meet the major needs in the diagnosis and treatment of major diseases based on a global perspective. © 2020, Science Press.

As the rate of infection starts to slow, healthcare facilities and economies attempt to return to normalcy in a graduated manner and the massive pent-up demand for surgeries needs to eventually be addressed in a systematic and equitable manner. Materials and methods: Guidelines from the Alliance of International Organizations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Orthopaedic Trauma Association, American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anaesthesiologists, Association of perioperative Registered Nurses, American Hospital Association, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were evaluated and summarized into a working framework, relevant to orthopaedic surgeons. Results: The guiding principles for restarting elective surgeries in a safe and acceptable manner include up-to-date disease awareness, projection and judicious management of equipment and facilities, effective human resource management, a fair and transparent system to prioritize cases, optimization of peri-operative workflows and continuous data gathering and clinical governance. Conclusion: The world was ill prepared for the initial COVID-19 outbreak. However, with effective forward planning, institutions can ramp-up elective surgical caseload in a safe and equitable manner. © 2020 IJS Publishing Group Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Elective surgery; Orthopaedic surgery; Pandemic anesthesiologist; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; elective surgery; health care facility; health workforce; human; international organization; medicaid; medical society; medicare; orthopedic surgeon; orthopedic surgery; pandemic; perioperative period; practice guideline; priority journal; public health service; registered nurse; resource management; Review; traumatology; World Health Organization; anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; organization and management; orthopedic surgery; orthopedics; perioperative nursing; personnel management; procedures; United States; virus pneumonia; workflow; American Hospital Association; Anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Medicare; Orthopedic Procedures; Orthopedics; Pandemics; Perioperative Nursing; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Societies, Medical; Traumatology; United States; Workflow; World Health Organization Newly emerging human coronaviruses: Animal models and vaccine research for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 The recent emergence of the novel coronavirus (CoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global threat to human health and economy. As of June 26, 2020, over 9.4 million cases of infection, including 482,730 deaths, had been confirmed across 216 countries. To combat a devastating virus pandemic, numerous studies on vaccine development are urgently being accelerated. In this review article, we take a brief look at the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoVs and discuss recent approaches to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development. © 2020.

As the world is struggling to minimize the transmission of this devastating disease, several strategies are being actively deployed to develop therapeutic interventions. Pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers are relentlessly working to investigate experimental, repurposed or FDA-approved drugs on a compassionate basis and novel biologics for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and treatment. Presently, a tremendous surge of COVID-19 clinical trials are advancing through different stages. Among currently registered clinical efforts, ~86% are centered on testing small molecules or antibodies either alone or in combination with immunomodulators. The rest ~14% of clinical efforts are aimed at evaluating vaccines and convalescent plasma-based therapies to mitigate the disease's symptoms. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic modalities being evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Nevertheless, the negative local impacts of the pandemic will be particularly harsh for those parts of South Africa where tourism is a critical sector in the local economy. The objective in this article is to identify the tourism spaces of vulnerability in South Africa. Use is made of the IHS Global Insight data base for 2016 to analyse at a local authority scale the most vulnerable localities to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indicators used to isolate tourism spaces of vulnerability are total tourism spend; tourism spend as a proportion of local GDP; domestic and international tourism (trips and bednights); and, leisure, business and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travel. The analysis discloses those local authorities that are the most vulnerable to the downturn/collapse of tourism as a whole as well as to the hollowing out of specific forms of tourism, namely domestic as opposed to international travel, leisure as opposed to business or VFR travel. © 2020 AJHTL /Author(s).

Barring the essential services, most of the business activities and transport sectors have been suspended and an unprecedented lockdown imposed over major economies in the world. South-East Asian regions, such as India and China, were no different. As a result, the pollutant level has gone down over these regions, and the air quality improved somewhat better than it was before the lockdown. This study uses satellite retrievals and attempts to estimate the extent of the reduction of major pollutants, like carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in India and China during January to April, 2020. We have calculated anomalies of pollutants during the lockdown period relative to their long-term records. NO2, which has significant emissions from the transport sector, is reduced on an average by 17% over India and 25% over China. SO2, which mainly emits from power plants, shows significant reductions (approx. 17%) especially over the Eastern sector of India. CO is found to be reduced by 6.5% over north-central China. The differential reduction was attributed to man made versus natural activities. This study is helpful to policy makers in mitigating the air-pollution on a long-term perspective. © The Author(s).

The proposed primary culprit of COVID-19 is the intense inflammatory response—an augmented immune response and cytokine storm—severely damaging the lung tissue and rendering some patients’ conditions severe enough to require assisted ventilation. Sex differences in the response to inflammation have been documented and can be attributed, at least in part, to sex steroid hormones. Moreover, age-associated decreases in sex steroid hormones, namely, estrogen and testosterone, may mediate proinflammatory increases in older adults that could increase their risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Sex hormones can mitigate the inflammation response and might provide promising therapeutic potential for patients with COVID-19. In this article, we explore the possible anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen and testosterone and the anabolic effect of testosterone, with particular attention to the potential therapeutic role of hormone replacement therapy in older men and women with COVID-19. © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research  angiotensin converting enzyme 2; C reactive protein; estrogen; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; sex hormone; testosterone; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory agent; estrogen; testosterone; case fatality rate; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; disease severity; high risk population; hormone substitution; human; immune response; intensive care unit; lymphocytopenia; mortality; pathophysiology; postmenopause; protein expression; public health; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; virus load; vulnerable population; age; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; female; inflammation; male; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Estrogens; Female; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Testosterone COVID-19 Pandemic: Cardiovascular Complications and Future Implications Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is now a global pandemic with the highest number of affected individuals in the modern era. Not only is the infection inflicting significant morbidity and mortality, but there has also been a significant strain to the health care system and the economy. COVID-19 typically presents as viral pneumonia, occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. However, emerging evidence suggests that it has a significant impact on the cardiovascular (CV) system by direct myocardial damage, severe systemic inflammatory response, hypoxia, right heart strain secondary to ARDS and lung injury, and plaque rupture secondary to inflammation. Primary cardiac manifestations include acute myocarditis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and abnormal clotting. Several consensus documents have been released to help manage CV disease during this pandemic. In this review, we summarize key cardiac manifestations, their management, and future implications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.  antihypertensive agent; chloroquine; corticosteroid; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; immunomodulating agent; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; remdesivir; ribavirin; tocilizumab; adverse outcome; artificial ventilation; atrioventricular block; brain hemorrhage; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular effect; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; deep vein thrombosis; drug use; electrolyte disturbance; extracorporeal oxygenation; heart arrhythmia; heart bundle branch block; heart disease; heart infarction; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart muscle injury; heart muscle ischemia; heart output; heart ventricle arrhythmia; hemolytic anemia; human; hypertension; immunotherapy; intracranial hypertension; ischemia; lung embolism; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; QT prolongation; QTc prolongation; respiratory alkalosis; Review; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; torsade des pointes; transfusion related acute lung injury; venous thromboembolism; cardiovascular disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; myocarditis; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Myocarditis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral COVID-19: Unique public health issues facing Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities The 2019 coronavirus disease is a serious public health emergency, with serious adverse implications for populations, healthcare systems, and economies globally. Recently, concerns have been raised about possible association between ethnicity, incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 arisen from early government data. In this review, we will explore the possible association using both recent COVID-19 studies and studies of previous pandemics. We call for data on ethnicity to be routinely collected by governments, as part of an international collaboration, alongside other patient demographics and further research to robustly determine the magnitude of association. Moreover, governments must learn from previous pandemics and recommended strategies to mitigate risks on minority ethnicities due to socioeconomic disadvantages. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.  vitamin D; ACE2 gene; adaptive immunity; Asian; attitude to health; BCG vaccination; Black person; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; cellular immunity; coronary artery disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cultural factor; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease predisposition; disease severity; ethnic group; gene; genetic polymorphism; genetic predisposition; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; government; health care policy; high risk population; human; hypertension; incidence; innate immunity; kidney disease; lifestyle; lung function; oxidative stress; pandemic; public health; quantitative trait locus; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; social status; socioeconomics; vitamin blood level; vitamin D deficiency; Asian continental ancestry group; Betacoronavirus; Black person; Coronavirus infection; ethnic group; ethnology; health care disparity; incidence; international cooperation; isolation and purification; minority health; organization and management; pandemic; virus pneumonia; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Ethnic Groups; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Incidence; International Cooperation; Minority Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors Assessing Short-Term and Long-Term Economic and Environmental Effects of the COVID-19 Crisis in France In response to the COVID-19 health crisis, the French government has imposed drastic lockdown measures for a period of 55 days. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of these measures in the short and long term. We use a Computable General Equilibrium model designed to assess environmental and energy policies impacts at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. We find that the lockdown has led to a significant decrease in economic output of 5% of GDP, but a positive environmental impact with a 6.6% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020. Both decreases are temporary: economic and environmental indicators return to their baseline trajectory after a few years. CO2 emissions even end up significantly higher after the COVID-19 crisis when we account for persistently low oil prices. We then investigate whether implementing carbon pricing can still yield positive macroeconomic dividends in the post-COVID recovery. We find that implementing ambitious carbon pricing speeds up economic recovery while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. By maintaining high fossil fuel prices, carbon taxation reduces the imports of fossil energy and stimulates energy efficiency investments while the full redistribution of tax proceeds does not hamper the recovery. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

This paper addresses the complex and partly contradictory responses to these two crises, investigating their social anatomies. Using temporality, spatiality, and epistemic authority as the main conceptual vehicles, the two crises are systematically compared. Despite sharing a number of similarities, the most striking difference between the two crises is the urgency of action to counter the rapid spread of the pandemic as compared to the slow and meager action to mitigate longstanding, well-documented, and accelerating climate change. Although the tide now seems to have turned towards a quick and massive effort to restore the status quo-including attempts to restart the existing economic growth models, which imply an obvious risk for substantially increasing CO2 emissions-the article finally points at some signs of an opening window of opportunity for green growth and degrowth initiatives. However, these signs have to be realistically interpreted in relation to the broader context of power relations in terms of governance configurations and regulatory strategies worldwide at different levels of society. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite the severity of some cases, there are no current pathogen-specific antivirals available to treat the disease. Therefore, many studies have focused on the evaluation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of clinically available drugs. Here, we conducted a systematic review to describe the drug repositioning strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and to discuss the clinical impact of this approach in the current pandemic context. The systematic review was performed on March 23, 2020, using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS). The data were summarized in tables and critically analyzed. After the database search, 12 relevant studies were identified as eligible for the review. Among the drugs reported in these studies, 57 showed some evidence of antiviral activity. Antivirals, especially antiretrovirals, are the main class of therapeutic agents evaluated against COVID-19. Moreover, studies have reported the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of antitumor (16%; 9/57), antimalarial (7%, 4/57), and antibacterial (5%; 3/57) agents. Additionally, seven pharmacological agents (chloroquine, tetrandrine, umifenovir (arbidol), carrimycin, damageprevir, lopinavir/ritonavir) are in phase IV of clinical trials. Due to the evidence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of various clinically available agents, drug repositioning stands out as a promising strategy for a short-term response in the fight against the novel coronavirus. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.  antiinfective agent; antimalarial agent; antineoplastic agent; antiretrovirus agent; antivirus agent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antimalarials; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Guidelines for communicating about bats to prevent persecution in the time of COVID-19 While the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on human health and national economies, conservationists are struggling to prevent misguided persecution of bats, which are misleadingly being blamed for spreading the disease. Although at a global level, such persecution is relatively uncommon, even a few misguided actions have the potential to cause irrevocable damage to already vulnerable species. Here, we draw on the latest findings from psychology, to explain why some conservation messaging may be reinforcing misleading negative associations. We provide guidelines to help ensure that conservation messaging is working to neutralize dangerous and unwarranted negative-associations between bats and disease-risk. We provide recommendations around three key areas of psychological science: (i) debunking misinformation; (ii) counteracting negative associations; and (iii) changing harmful social norms. We argue that only by carefully framing accurate, honest, and duly contextualized information, will we be able to best serve society and present an unbiased perspective of bats. We hope this guidance will help conservation practitioners and researchers to develop effective message framing strategies that minimize zoonotic health risks and support biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Behavioural change; Conservation communication; Conservation psychology; Human-wildlife conflict; Message framing; Zoonoses bat; biodiversity; conservation planning; disease spread; ecosystem service; guideline; health risk; psychology; public health Green tax reform in Australia in the presence of improved environment-induced productivity gain: Does it offer sustainable recovery from a Post-COVID-19 recession? Disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19 will change the world in many ways and the road to redemption from the ongoing economic distress may require a novel approach. This paper proposes a path towards economic recovery that keeps sustainability at the forefront. A computable general equilibrium model is used to simulate different green tax reform (GTR) policies for triple dividend (TD), consisting of lower emissions, higher GDP and higher employment. The GTR design consists of an energy tax coupled with one of three tax revenue recycle methods: (i) reduction of payroll tax, (ii) reduction of goods and services tax (GST) and (iii) a mixed-recycling approach. The paper also presents the impact of higher productivity on the tax reform simulations, which is a possible positive externality of lower emissions. The study is based on the Australian economy and the salient findings are twofold: (i) productivity gain in the GTR context improves the GDP and employment outcomes in all three different simulation scenarios and (ii) GST reduction has the highest TD potential, followed by reduction of payroll tax. © 2020 by the authors.

During and after the crisis, there are opportunities and needs for remote work facilities, online services, delivery drones, etc. We discuss how unmanned technologies can cause a long-term employment decrease, and why compensation mechanisms may not work. Using the internationally comparable Frey–Osborne methodology, we estimated that less than a third of employees in Russia work in professions with a high automation probability. Some of these professions can suffer the most during quarantine measures; employment in traditional services can be significantly reduced. By 2030, about half of the jobs in the world and a little less in Russia will need to adapt during the fourth industrial revolution because they are engaged in routine, potentially automated activities. In the regions, specializing in manufacturing, this value is higher; the lowest risk is in the largest agglomerations with a high share of digital economy, greater and diverse labour markets. Accelerating technological change can lead to a long-term mismatch between the exponential increase in automation rate and compensating effects of retraining, new jobs creation and other labour market adaptation mechanisms. Some people will not be ready for a life-long learning and competition with robots, and accordingly there is a possibility of their technological exclusion. The term “nescience economy” and corresponding assessment method were proposed. Using an econometric model, we identified factors that reduce these risks: human capital concentration, favourable business climate, high quality of life and ICT development.

There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here, we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of ~20μM, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2 to 3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3 2B4 [referred to here as ""Calu-3""]) were treated. Time-of-addition and plaque reduction assays performed on Vero E6 cells showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing binding or entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest that it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires safety studies and well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.

On April 20, 2020, World Health Organization(WHO) reported more than 2.2 million confirmed cases and 150000 deaths from a novel coronavirus (Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19; strain SARS-CoV-2). According to a macroeconomic forecast from Standard & Poor's Global Ratings, the global GDP will fall 2.4% this year, and the economic impact of COVID-19 is sure to be far-reaching. It is suspected that COVID-19 has a wildlife origin. Indeed, most emerging human infectious diseases, such as SARS, Ebola, and H1N1, originate in animals. However, animals that host infectious diseases not only play critical roles in disease transmission, control, and prevention, but also serve the basis for the maintenance and stability of natural ecosystems. Although the COVID-19 and other epidemic diseases remind us that information on animals and their pathogenic microbes is necessary to control the spread of zoonotic diseases before they turn into epidemics or pandemics, we have little knowledge on the behavior, ecology, life history, and the pathology of infected animals. Therefore, comprehensive and solid research should be performed on animals that carry pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, and prions). We searched published articles on infectious, endemic, and epidemic diseases in the Web of Science database and found that only 11.75% of articles (2930727 in total) were in the field of zoology. In contrast, more than half of the articles were in infectious diseases (biomedicine). Chinese researchers have published 221105 papers, 26.72% of the output of the United States. Even in the field of zoology, the US has published 86233 articles (2.83 times more than Chinese researchers). As solutions to the challenges of zoonotic epidemics require a public and comprehensive approach, we propose to develop a Convergence Science approach (transdisciplinary science) to study high-risk animals responsible for zoonotic epidemics. It aims to answer and resolve basic but essential questions. For example, what is the biological background of these animals, and how many ways can zoonotic diseases spillover? This effort is not limited to species classification, biological characters, evolutionary footprints, hosted microbes, behavior, and spillover approaches, nor field investigation, genetics, molecular biology, physiological, microbiology, mathematics, management, and veterinary medicine/science. While we appreciate the efforts of the medical research community to develop vaccines and medications to mitigate the spread of emerging diseases and to reduce human mortality rates, we argue that generating a dynamic list of pathogenic microbes and their wildlife hosts also represents an urgent and critical tool in ecological epidemiology. We call for a global and cooperative effort to create, maintain, and update this information in order to reduce the severity of future pandemics. A Convergence Science approach to the study of animals that host potential infectious diseases may allow the prediction and prevention of zoonotic epidemics, reduce or ablate the risk of zoonotic infection, and ensure biosecurity and public health. © 2020, Science Press.

A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein. By constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1 and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins. We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1. Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis. © 2020 ACE2; Antibody development; Antigenic analysis; Binding affinity; Computer simulation; Coronavirus; Electrostatic interactions; Epitopes; Host-pathogen interaction; pH effect; Protein-protein interaction; SARS-CoV-2 amino acid; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; epitope; monoclonal antibody; virus spike protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; monoclonal antibody; protein binding; spike glycoprotein, SARS-CoV; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; virus receptor; Article; binding affinity; chemical structure; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; crystal structure; dielectric constant; drug development; ionic strength; molecular recognition; Monte Carlo method; pH; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein domain; protein protein interaction; receptor binding; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; simulation; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; computer simulation; epitope mapping; human; immunology; metabolism; molecular model; protein analysis; protein conformation; protein domain; SARS coronavirus; thermodynamics; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Computer Simulation; Epitope Mapping; Humans; Models, Molecular; Monte Carlo Method; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Interaction Mapping; Receptors, Virus; SARS Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Thermodynamics A GNSS-based crowd-sensing strategy for specific geographical areas Infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, SARS, MERS, etc., have seriously endangered human safety, economy, and education. During the spread of epidemics, restricting the range of activities of personnel is one of the options for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. A global navigation satellite system (GNSS), it can provide accurate coordinates of latitude and longitude to targets with GNSS receivers. However, it is not common to use GNSS coordinates to represent positions in social life. For epidemic management, it is important to know the locations (and addresses) of targets, especially in social life. When there are many targets, it is not easy to efficiently map these coordinates to locations. Therefore, we propose a GNSS-based crowd-sensing strategy for specific geographical areas that can be used to calculate how many targets are in specific geographical areas or whether a target is in a specific area. This strategy is based on the coordinates of latitude and longitude provided by GNSS to find the locations of these coordinates. As simulated data, the data records containing latitude and longitude in a well-known social networking service platform are used. The strategy is also available for mining hot spots or hot areas. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

At present, the development of supply chain finance is facing an important point: The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has a wide impact on the global economy, which not only generates the strong demand for supply chain finance, but also brings new uncertainty. At the same time, the accelerated development of Fintech provides more possibilities and tools for supply chain finance model innovation and risk management. This paper summarizes the current situation of supply chain finance from two aspects of practical development and theoretical research, and analyzes its future development trend. First of all, the practical development of supply chain finance is sorted out and divided into four stages for analysis. Secondly, with the help of bibliometrics tools, this paper analyzes and compares English and Chinese literature, and summarizes the theoretical research status from three aspects: Theoretical basis, optimization decision-making and risk management. Finally, there are three development trends of supply chain finance in the future, that is, the formation of healthy network ecosystem is an important basis for the development of supply chain finance, the adoption of modern Fintech enabling is a powerful tool for the development of supply chain finance, and bearing the social responsibility of sustainable development is the long-term goal of supply chain finance development. Meanwhile, it gives five key research issues that deserve attention. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China. All right reserved.

Indeed, transport accessibility of households, businesses, and retail activities is one of the main drivers that influence location choices and sustainable development and where the public transport services may play a key (positive) role. Furthermore, the economic crisis of the 2009 and the current ones caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has further limited the funds available for public services, including the transport sector. In this critical context, sound design of public transport services assumes great importance, especially in light of financial constraints. Starting from these considerations, the aim of this paper has been to propose an innovative methodology for designing public transport services based on a rational decision-making process with stakeholder engagement, aiming to perform a sustainable development perspective. The proposed methodology combines technical aspects, social and political issues, equity perspectives, and it is aimed in obtaining a design solution that can be accepted by the whole community. The proposed theoretical design methodology has also been applied to a case study in order to verify its applicability to a real context, consisting of the design of the public transport plan of the province of Foggia in southern Italy. Applications results show that the sustainable design scenario is not only the best ones from a technical point of view, but also participated, equitable, and approved by both policymakers and stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.

The badly balanced world market and the high degree of financialization of both primary agricultural production and food chains are decisive factors in this. The crisis highlights that the real economy is far too dependent on the financial economy. Financial capital operates as a paralyzing force. In this situation food sovereignty, peasant agriculture, territorial markets and agroecology emerge as indispensable ingredients for a recovery. © 2020 The Author(s).

Although the case is necessarily concise, several links are given to the online articles and video material on which the case is based. This allows participants to deepen their knowledge of the virus and their understanding of its likely economic impact. To frame the discussion, several philosophies, ranging from Libertarianism to Marxism, are lightly expounded. Readers will need to consider divergent ideas; the sanctity of human life versus the monetary value of a life; the hysteria evoked by COVID-19 deaths versus the placid acceptance of an annual 66,000 deaths by another disease – TB; and the differential economic impact of the virus across extremes of inequality. Perhaps, the key issue relates to the skewness in the death rate: Should young people’s livelihood be sacrificed for a few old people about to die anyway? The case also illustrates the essence of a dilemma – a situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between two or more alternatives, especially ones that are equally undesirable. Case overview/synopsis: In March 2020, South African President Cyril Ramaposa ordered a 21-day national “lockdown” to enable and enforce social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19. Many other countries had already taken similar steps, but in a country with 43,000 murders annually, South Africa’s response to only 11 COVID-19 deaths and 1,071 cases was both rapid and harsh. Schools, businesses, social areas and parks were closed. Medical emergencies, essential services and weekly grocery shopping were the only permissible activities. Two weeks after lockdown, there were 1,845 cases and 18 deaths, a far cry from the predicted 30,000 cases and 300 deaths, estimated on the basis of the three-day doubling rate at the start of lockdown. Many businesses, pulverised by closure, daily wage earners and those fearful of losing jobs were hopeful that the lockdown would not be extended. In a country with immense inequality, how would the masses under the age of 65 years, already in poverty and now with their lives pulled apart by an imported disease of the wealthy, respond to extended social and economic deprivation followed by bailouts for business?

The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with preexisting conditions—such as asthma, cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or obesity—experience higher risk of becoming severely ill if infected with the virus. Systemic social inequality and discrepancies in socioeconomic status (SES) contribute to higher incidence of asthma, CVD, hypertension, CKD, and obesity in segments of the general population. Such preexisting conditions bring heightened risk of complications for individuals who contract the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the virus (2019-nCoV)—also known as “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). In order to help vulnerable groups during times of a health emergency, focus must be placed at the root of the problem. Studying the social determinants of health (SDOH), and how they impact disadvantaged populations during times of crisis, will help governments to better manage health emergencies so that every individual has equal opportunity to staying healthy. This review summarizes the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) during the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Singu, Acharya, Challagundla and Byrareddy.

As the SARS-CoV-2 virus wreaks havoc on the populations, health care infrastructures and economies of nations around the world, finding ways to protect health care workers and bolster immune responses in the general population while we await an effective vaccine will be the difference between life and death for many people. Recent studies show that innate immune populations may possess a form of memory, termed Trained Immunity (TRIM), where innate immune cells undergo metabolic, mitochondrial, and epigenetic reprogramming following exposure to an initial stimulus that results in a memory phenotype of enhanced immune responses when exposed to a secondary, heterologous, stimulus. Throughout the literature, it has been shown that the induction of TRIM using such inducers as the BCG vaccine and β-glucan can provide protection through altered immune responses against a range of viral infections. Here we hypothesize a potential role for β-glucan in decreasing worldwide morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, and posit several ideas as to how TRIM may actually shape the observed epidemiological phenomena related to COVID-19. We also evaluate the potential effects of β-glucan in relation to the immune dysregulation and cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Ultimately, we hypothesize that the use of oral β-glucan in a prophylactic setting could be an effective way to boost immune responses and abrogate symptoms in COVID-19, though clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this treatment and to further examine differential effects of β-glucan's from various sources. © Copyright © 2020 Geller and Yan.

Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. Methods: Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. Results: We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, Inhibitory Concentration50 (IC50), MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition. Conclusion: The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2. © 2020 The Author(s).

Resource-poor countries with weaker health systems are struggling with epidemics of their own and are now in a more uncertain situation with this rapidly spreading infection. Frontline healthcare workers are succumbing to the infection in their efforts to save lives. There is an urgency to develop treatments for COVID-19, yet there is limited clinical data on the efficacy of potential drug treatments. Countries worldwide implemented a stay-at-home order to “flatten the curve” and relieve the pressure on the health system, but it is uncertain how this will unfold after the economy reopens. Trehalose, a natural glucose disaccharide, is known to impair viral function through the autophagy system. Here, we propose trehalose as a potential preventative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. © Copyright © 2020 Martinon, Borges, Gomez and Shimada. autophagy; COVID-19; prophylaxis; SARS-CoV-2; trehalose interleukin 1beta; peptides and proteins; transcription factor eb; trehalose; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; trehalose; adult respiratory distress syndrome; autophagy (cellular); clinical trial (topic); contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; cross presentation; cytokine release; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; herd immunity; human; infection control; nonhuman; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virus replication; virus transmission; adult; aged; asymptomatic disease; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; middle aged; pandemic; physiology; post exposure prophylaxis; pre-exposure prophylaxis; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Asymptomatic Diseases; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Post-Exposure Prophylaxis; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Trehalose; Virus Replication COVID-19: Emergence of Infectious Diseases, Nanotechnology Aspects, Challenges, and Future Perspectives Wuhan, a city of China, is the epicenter for the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses. The antiviral drugs and their clinical advances, along with herbal medicines for viral inhibition and immunity boosters, are described.

An outbreak of a novel coronavirus 2019 infection has posed significant threat to the health and economies in the whole world. This article reviewed the viral replication, pathogenicity, prevention and treatment strategies. With a lack of approved treatment options for this virus, alternative approaches to control the spread of disease is in urgent need. This article also covers some management strategies which may be applied to this virus outbreak.

Increasing the federal share of Medicaid spending as unemployment rises would mitigate fiscal pressure on states and preserve public services. But unlike the demand for Medicaid’s health care protections, which rises when economic activity declines, the demand for long-term care protections will grow even in a healthy economy as the population ages. Enhanced federal support is urgent not only to cope with the virus today but also to meet the long-term care needs of the nation’s aging population in the years to come. Long-term care financing policy should be modified to either adjust federal matching funds by the age of each state’s population, or fully federalize the funding of LTC expenses of Medicaid beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicare. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

The coherence wavelet method and the wavelet-based Granger causality tests applied to US recent daily data unveil the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 and oil price shocks on the geopolitical risk levels, economic policy uncertainty and stock market volatility over the low frequency bands. The effect of the COVID-19 on the geopolitical risk substantially higher than on the US economic uncertainty. The COVID-19 risk is perceived differently over the short and the long-run and may be firstly viewed as an economic crisis.

There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A systematic literature review of Coronavirus related diseases in Pakistan Pakistan is also seeing the profound effect of the outbreak of COVID-19, which demands an urgent investigation of literature and further scientific investigation for cure and prevention. This study has employed the systematic approach for searching the literature from the recently compiled database of researches namely COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and related diseases. The literature on Pakistan has shown the evidence of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission of viruses, the presence of antibodies of MERS-CoV in camels, and careless attitude towards preventive measures of such respiratory diseases. There is a lot of gap in the literature regarding coronaviruses and their antibodies creating herd immunity for another coronavirus and COVID-19. In particular to Pakistan, and in general, for other developing countries, a weak health-care system coupled with the trembling economy has many implications of COVID-19 which should be carefully thought-out to combat the spread. © 2020 Haq et al.

The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)–B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Chronic diseases; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Immune deficiency; Pandemic; Pollutants; SARS-CoV-2; Xenobiotics angiotensin converting enzyme 2; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; fossil fuel; heavy metal; multi walled nanotube; pesticide; xenobiotic agent; antivirus agent; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; airborne particle; Article; biochemistry; biophysics; cell function; cell level; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; dietary supplement; economic aspect; human; immune deficiency; immune system; immunopathology; immunotoxicity; intestine flora; ionizing radiation; lifestyle; long term exposure; macrophage; pandemic; particulate matter; pollutant; prevalence; protein expression; public health; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; ultraviolet B radiation; virus immunity; vulnerable population; air pollutant; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diet; drug effect; epidemic; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; time; toxicity; virus pneumonia; Air Pollutants; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diet; Epidemics; Humans; Immune System; Pandemics; Pesticides; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Time; Xenobiotics COVID-19 healthcare planning: Predicting mortality and the role of the herd immunity barrier in the general population Using a mathematical model for COVID-19 incorporating data on excess of mortality compared to the corresponding period of the previous year obtained from the daily monitoring of mortality in Spain (MoMo), the prediction of total number of casualties in Spain for the first outbreak has been computed. From this figure, and following a stepwise meta-analysis of available reports, the case fatality rate (CFR) and the infectious case fatality rate (IFR) for the outbreak have been estimated. As the impact of age on these rates is notable, it is proposed to include an age-related adjusted fatality ratio in future comparative analyses between studies, calculated by adjusting the results by risk ratio to a reference age band (e.g., 60-69). From the casualty figures, and the corresponding CFR and IFR ratios, the forecast of serologically positive cases in the general Spanish population has been estimated at approximately 1% (0.87-1.3%) of the samples. If the data are confirmed by the ongoing study of the Carlos III Institute, until a vaccine is found, the immunity acquired in the general population after the infectious outbreak is far from the 65-70% herd immunity required as a barrier for COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, most COVID-19 patients receive traditional supportive care including breathing assistance. To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Second, since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development that aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation. © 2020 The Authors.

As governments consider public health and economic strategies to respond to the crisis, it is critical they also address the weaknesses of their economic and social systems that inhibited their ability to respond comprehensively to the pandemic. These same weaknesses have also undermined efforts to advance equality and sustainability. This paper explores over 30 interventions across the following nine categories of change that hold the potential to address inequality, provide all citizens with access to essential goods and services, and advance progress towards sustainability: (1) Income and wealth transfers to facilitate an equitable increase in purchasing power/disposable income; (2) broadening worker and citizen ownership of the means of production and supply of services, allowing corporate profit-taking to be more equitably distributed; (3) changes in the supply of essential goods and services for more citizens; (4) changes in the demand for more sustainable goods and services desired by people; (5) stabilizing and securing employment and the workforce; (6) reducing the disproportionate power of corporations and the very wealthy on the market and political system through the expansion and enforcement of antitrust law such that the dominance of a few firms in critical sectors no longer prevails; (7) government provision of essential goods and services such as education, healthcare, housing, food, and mobility; (8) a reallocation of government spending between military operations and domestic social needs; and (9) suspending or restructuring debt from emerging and developing countries. Any interventions that focus on growing the economy must also be accompanied by those that offset the resulting compromises to health, safety, and the environment from increasing unsustainable consumption. This paper compares and identifies the interventions that should be considered as an important foundational first step in moving beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and towards sustainability. In this regard, it provides a comprehensive set of strategies that could advance progress towards a component of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 to reduce inequality within countries. However, the candidate interventions are also contrasted with all 17 SDGs to reveal potential problem areas/tradeoffs that may need careful attention. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus, it is important to understand how global factors linked with the functioning of the Anthropocene are responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. We tested hypotheses that the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths and growth rate of recorded infections: (1) are positively associated with population density as well as (2) proportion of the human population living in urban areas as a proxies of interpersonal contact rate, (3) age of the population in a given country as an indication of that population's susceptibility to COVID-19; (4) net migration rate and (5) number of tourists as proxies of infection pressure, and negatively associated with (5) gross domestic product which is a proxy of health care quality. Data at the country level were compiled from publicly available databases and analysed with gradient boosting regression trees after controlling for confounding factors (e.g. geographic location). We found a positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases in a given country and gross domestic product, number of tourists, and geographic longitude. The number of deaths was positively associated with gross domestic product, number of tourists in a country, and geographic longitude. The effects of gross domestic product and number of tourists were non-linear, with clear thresholds above which the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased rapidly. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was positively linked to the number of tourists and gross domestic product. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was negatively associated with the mean age of the population and geographic longitude. Growth was slower in less urbanised countries. This study demonstrates that the characteristics of the human population and high mobility, but not population density, may help explain the global spread of the virus. In addition, geography, possibly via climate, may play a role in the pandemic. The unexpected positive and strong association between gross domestic product and number of cases, deaths, and growth rate suggests that COVID-19 may be a new civilisation disease affecting rich economies. © 2020 Skórka et al.

While lockdowns may be an important tool to limit transmission, they come at a potentially great cost with regard to economic impact, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from non–COVID-19 diseases. Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries. Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to “unlock” or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. “Precision physical distancing”—distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings—is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19. It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures. Precision physical distancing can be one important component of a sustainable long-term solution that is proportionate to the risk yet does not have a disproportionate impact on society and the economy, allowing a partial return to normal activities, with the community as an essential partner.

Further, factors responsible for outbreak mismanagement with strategies for effective preparedness is focused. It also highlights the age-old colonial law, so-called the backbone of Indian healthcare policy in strategizing healthcare emergencies. The gaps in the present policy indicate an immediate requirement for an overarching law that governs public health care. The review also envisages the safety and security measures taken by the Indian government against COVID-19, prioritising health over the economy. Finally, flagship changes required in national healthcare policy to prepare the country to fight against any upcoming pandemic outbreaks are suggested. © 2020, Radiance Research Academy.

In order to be better equipped to anticipate transmission of this virus to new regions, it is imperative to track the progress of the virus over time. This review analyses information on progression of the pandemic in the past 3 months and systematically discusses the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2019 virus including its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, the review also encompasses some recently proposed conceptual models that estimate the spread of this disease based on the basic reproductive number for better prevention and control procedures. Finally, we shed light on how the virus has endangered the global economy, impacting it both from the supply and demand side. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd ACE-2; COVID-19; mathematical modeling; pandemic; SARS-CoV alpha interferon; arbidol; chloroquine; favipiravir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; antivirus agent; antibody detection; antigen detection; basic reproduction number; clinical feature; computer model; conceptual model; coronavirus disease 2019; genome analysis; human; meta analysis; pandemic; pathophysiology; physical disease by body function; prevention and control; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus classification; virus morphology; virus transmission; adaptive immunity; Betacoronavirus; classification; commercial phenomena; Coronavirus infection; economics; genetics; laboratory technique; pandemic; pathogenicity; physiology; theoretical model; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; virus replication; Adaptive Immunity; Antiviral Agents; Basic Reproduction Number; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Commerce; Coronavirus Infections; Economics; Genome, Viral; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Replication COVID-19 Outbreak: An Overview Background: In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Summary: A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures. © 2020 S.

The current pandemic caused by this coronavirus has already negatively affected millions of people and the economies of countries worldwide. However, the challenges faced by Saudi Arabia during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic that began in 2012 led to marked improvements in the government's response to the current pandemic. Saudi Arabia is one of largest countries in the Middle East and is home to the holiest Muslim sites. Since the global risk of the virus was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia has taken substantial public health measures to control the spread of the infection. This review reports on the transmission of SARS-COV-2 in Saudi Arabia and the proactive responses taken by the government, comparing the Saudi government's actions and their effects with those of other countries. Although Saudi Arabia is currently experiencing the peak of the pandemic, their early precautionary responses have shortened the period of individual/family isolation, reduced the number of confirmed infections and infection-related fatality rates, and decreased the economic burden of the people and the country compared with other countries in the Middle East and elsewhere. © 2020 Obeid et al.

Although it primarily affects the lungs, it shares a strong interplay with the cardiovascular system. The presence of underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) predispose the patients to increased severity and mortality associated with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 itself leads to various cardiovascular complications, which increase its associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients. It is, therefore, prudent to review the rapidly evolving data in this field and understand the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular involvement of this lethal disease. © 2020 Cardiovascular disease; Comorbidities; Complications; Coronavirus; COVID-19 angiotensin converting enzyme 2; natriuretic factor; troponin; acute coronary syndrome; acute heart failure; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular disease; childhood mortality; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease association; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart injury; human; immune response; morbidity; myocarditis; primary prevention; prognosis; Review; risk factor; thromboembolism; treatment indication; venous thromboembolism Crisis Decision-Making on a Global Scale: Transition from Cognition to Collective Action under Threat of COVID-19 This essay examines basic functions of crisis decision-making—cognition, communication, coordination, and control—in response to COVID-19. This crisis decision-making framework is applied to cases from South Korea, Italy, and the United States as public officials grapple with how to recognize, respond, and recover from this deadly, invisible threat. The authors acknowledge the harsh trade-off between the compelling need to limit transmission of the virus to protect public health and the consequent economic losses of halting social interaction. They draw implications from this crisis for better decision-making and investment in a global information infrastructure system to manage large-scale, multidisciplinary threats to the health, economy, and sustainability of the world's community of nations. The essay concludes that collective cognition, amplified by timely, valid communication and supported by sound planning, trained personnel, appropriate technology, and bold leadership, enables coordinated action needed to bring a large-scale global crisis under control. Evidence for Practice: Invest in information technology to manage systematic data collection, analysis, and modeling. Provide timely, informed updates on community status to constituents. Maintain a knowledge base of resources, vulnerabilities, and plans. © 2020 by The American Society for Public Administration   A comprehensive review on drug repositioning against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the reason for this ongoing pandemic infection diseases termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has emerged since early December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. In this century, it is the worst threat to international health and the economy. After 4 months of COVID-19 outbreak, there is no certain and approved medicine against it. In this public health emergency, it makes sense to investigate the possible effects of old drugs and find drug repositioning that is efficient, economical, and riskless process. Old drugs that may be effective are from different pharmacological categories, antimalarials, anthelmintics, anti-protozoal, anti-HIVs, anti-influenza, anti-hepacivirus, antineoplastics, neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulins, and interferons. In vitro, in vivo, or preliminary trials of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging, leading to new research projects and trials to find the best drug/s. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of these drugs against COVID-19. Also, it should be mentioned that in this manuscript, we discuss preliminary rationales; however, clinical trial evidence is needed to prove them. COVID-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations. Moreover, herein, we describe current evidence that may be changed in the future. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

There are few reports on factors influencing the transmission of 2019-nCoV, such as environmental conditions (humidity and temperature), air pollution, and human activities. It is difficult to sample and research 2019-nCoV directly. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the factors influencing the spread and survival of other similar viruses, which is instructional for the prevention of epidemics and the control of 2019-nCoV transmission. The results show that: (1) Low temperature and low humidity could prolong the lifetime and increase the transmission of coronavirus, especially on dry surfaces. For example, coronavirus can survive on a smooth surface at a temperature of 22-25 ℃ and a relative humidity (RH) of 40%-45% for more than 5 days. (2) Similarly, the survival rates of the aerosolized coronavirus is also high in a closed environment at low temperature and low humidity, 2019-nCoV may hold high survival rates at a temperature of 20-25 ℃ and a relative humidity of 30%-50%. (3) The higher the particle concentration, the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission may increase. (4) The behavior of infected people also plays a important role in the transmission of 2019-nCoV. The transmission of virus can be reduced by avoiding sneezing and coughing in the crowd, and blocking the transmission of droplets using hands, elbows or other objects. Considering the above analysis, some suggestions for the prevention and control the epidemics are made, such as improving the indoor microenvironment, investigating the detection, inactivation, influence factors and propagation characteristics of 2019-nCoV. © 2020, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

In spite of all assets utilized to neutralize the spreading of the infection, worldwide systems are expected to deal with the related emotional wellbeing issues. This flare-up is prompting extra medical issues, for example, stress, nervousness and sleeping disorders. Aggregate concerns impact day to day practices, economy, health associations and clinical centers, which can debilitate methodologies of COVID-19 control and lead to greater needs at a worldwide level. There have been unprecedented measures adopted to control the rapid spread during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey deals with the adherence to control measures exhibited by the public, effects on their life and their knowledge and awareness levels were evaluated and analysed. A self developed questionnaire of about 15 questions was prepared and circulated in google forms.The questions were based on the participants awareness level and practice of the preventive measures. This survey was conducted among the South Indian population using an online platform. 100 people have responded to the survey. The data was evaluated using SPSS software and Chisquare test was used for assessing statistical significance,p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Above average level of awareness of the preventive measures and possible development of mental and emotional issues were exhibited by the participants. Though the level of awareness wass high, other issues like the emotional challenges were present in more than 50% of the participants. The study shows that the general public has a high awareness level on preventive measures and treatment of emotional issues are the need of the hour. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

This paper seeks to prompt a conversation about third sector research agendas, which might be animated in and beyond coronavirus, focusing primarily on the experience of the sector in the UK but including references globally. After a brief discussion of the acute three-dimensional crisis facing the sector, the paper raises questions for now and later at three interconnected levels: of practice, organisation and society. The paper concludes with a call for critically engaged curiosity about the role and fortunes of the third sector in a time of lockdown and its aftermath. © Policy Press 2020 Charity; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Third sector  A multiscale model of virus pandemic: Heterogeneous interactive entities in a globally connected world This paper is devoted to the multidisciplinary modelling of a pandemic initiated by an aggressive virus, specifically the so-called SARS-CoV-2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, corona virus n.2. The study is developed within a multiscale framework accounting for the interaction of different spatial scales, from the small scale of the virus itself and cells, to the large scale of individuals and further up to the collective behaviour of populations. An interdisciplinary vision is developed thanks to the contributions of epidemiologists, immunologists and economists as well as those of mathematical modellers. The first part of the contents is devoted to understanding the complex features of the system and to the design of a modelling rationale. The modelling approach is treated in the second part of the paper by showing both how the virus propagates into infected individuals, successfully and not successfully recovered, and also the spatial patterns, which are subsequently studied by kinetic and lattice models. The third part reports the contribution of research in the fields of virology, epidemiology, immune competition, and economy focussed also on social behaviours. Finally, a critical analysis is proposed looking ahead to research perspectives. © 2020 The Author(s). complexity; COVID-19; immune competition; intracellular infection dynamics; living systems; multiscale problems; networks; SARS-CoV-2; spatial patterns; viral quasispecies; virus structure modelling Economics; Viruses; Collective behaviour; Critical analysis; Lattice models; Multi-scale frameworks; Multi-scale Modeling; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Social behaviour; Spatial patterns; Diseases Research on intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics [面向重大疫情应急防控的智能机器人系统研究] In recent years, SARS virus, MERS coronavirus, and other global pandemics have occurred frequently. The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused more than 3.7 million infected people and 260000 deaths over 210 countries around the world from December 2019 to May 7, 2020, which has seriously affected the safety of people, the stability of social order, and the development of the economy. Therefore, it is urgent to explore and implement new prevention and control programs for such major pandemics. With the development of robots and artificial intelligence technologies, various intelligent robots for emergency prevention and control in complex conditions have emerged, and they have played paramount roles in disease prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing. Based on the problems of insufficient supply of materials and heavy disinfection tasks during the prevention and control of major outbreaks, we study the systematic procedures and applications of medical material handling robots, multi-scene disinfection robots, medical assistant robots, prevention and control robots, and production resumption robots. Moreover, we comparatively analyze the current situation of key technologies of pandemic emergency prevention and control robots, such as environmental perception, autonomous navigation, motion planning, and 5G communication technology. In conclusion, we put forward a technical prospect of intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics. © 2020, Science Press.

The epidemic lifetime should be accurate so that timely and remedial steps are determined. These include the closing of borders schools, suspension of community and commuting services. The forecast of an outbreak effectively is a very necessary but difficult task. A predictive model that provides the best possible forecast is a great challenge for machine learning with only a few samples of training available. This work proposes and examines a prediction model based on a deep extreme learning machine (DELM). This methodology is used to carry out an experiment based on the recent Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. An optimized prediction model that has been developed, namely DELM, is demonstrated to be able to make a prediction that is fairly best. The results show that the new methodology is useful in developing an appropriate forecast when the samples are far from abundant during the critical period of the disease.

The virus uses its spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain to interact with host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) sites to initiate a cascade of events that culminate in severe acute respiratory syndrome in some individuals. In efforts to curtail viral spread, authorities initiated far-reaching lockdowns that have disrupted global economies. The scientific and medical communities are mounting serious efforts to limit this pandemic and subsequent waves of viral spread by developing preventative vaccines and repurposing existing drugs as potential therapies. In this review, we focus on the latest developments in COVID-19 vaccine development, including results of the first Phase I clinical trials and describe a number of the early candidates that are emerging in the field. We seek to provide a balanced coverage of the seven main platforms used in vaccine development that will lead to a desired target product profile for the “ideal” vaccine. Using tales of past vaccine discovery efforts that have taken many years or that have failed, we temper over exuberant enthusiasm with cautious optimism that the global medical community will reach the elusive target to treat COVID-19 and end the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Funk, Laferrière and Ardakani. clinical trial; coronavirus; COVID-19; immune response; public health; SARS-CoV-2; vaccine advac; azd 1222; bnt 162; coronavac; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; COVID 19 vaccine; DNA vaccine; inactivated virus vaccine; ino 4800; live vaccine; messenger RNA 1273; nvxcov 237; nvxcov 2373; per.c6; placebo; recombinant protein; RNA vaccine; scb 2019; unclassified drug; coronavirus disease 2019; drug design; drug research; drug targeting; human; Human adenovirus 5; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptomatology; treatment indication; vaccination; virus genome; virus transmission Chemistry and Biology of SARS-CoV-2 Challenges and opportunities: • The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has changed our world in just half a year: a large number of people have died from the virus-induced pneumonia COVID-19, and the global economy is at an unprecedented low with unknown near- and long-term consequences. • The coronavirus pandemic needs a two-pronged approach: a short-term solution to find a drug to treat the massive number of seriously ill patients, and long-term development of preventive and curative drugs for future corona outbreaks. • De novo drug discovery takes years to move from idea and/or pre-clinic to market release and is not a short-term solution for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Drug repurposing is perhaps the only short-term solution, and vaccination is a middle-term solution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV or Wuhan coronavirus) caused an unprecedented fast-spreading worldwide pandemic. Although currently with a rather low mortality rate, the virus spread rapidly over the world using the modern world's traffic highways. The coronavirus (CoV) family members were responsible for several deadly outbreaks and epidemics during the last decade. Not only governments but also the scientific community reacted promptly to the outbreak, and information is shared quickly. For example, the genetic fingerprint was shared, and the 3D structure of key proteins was rapidly solved, which can be used for the discovery of potential treatments. An overview is given on the current knowledge of the spread, disease course, and molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. We discuss potential treatment developments in the context of recent outbreaks, drug repurposing, and development timelines. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.This perspective covers the chemistry and biology of SARS-CoV-2 and potential pharmacological interventions of the coronavirus pandemic, including discussion of the different drug modalities such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]). The most likely scenario for a short-term solution of the COVID-19 crisis is the multiple drug repurposing approaches currently being pursued. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. antiviral; drug repurposing; protease; SARS-CoV-2; SDG11: Sustainable cities and communities; SDG15: Life on land; SDG3: Good health and well-being; target  Covid-19 Outbreak In Italy: Are We Ready for the Psychosocial and the Economic Crisis? Baseline Findings From the PsyCovid Study The Covid-19 pandemic is burning all over the world. National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding the psychosocial and economic effects is growing quickly. The PsyCovid Study assessed the influence of psychosocial variables on individual differences from the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the issues of health and economy in the Italian population. Italian volunteers from different regions completed an online anonymous survey. The main outcomes were the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health and the economy. A two-way MANOVA evaluated differences in the main outcomes, with geographical area (northern, central, and southern regions) and professional status (healthcare workers or not) as factors. We then tested the relationship linking psychosocial variables (i.e. perceived distress and social isolation, empathy, and coping style) to the main outcomes through two different mediation models. 1163 responders completed the survey (835 females; mean age: 42 ± 13.5 y.o.; age range: 18-81 y.o.) between March 14 and 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and people living in northern Italy reported a significantly worse outbreak impact on health, but not on the economy. In the whole sample, distress and loneliness were key variables influencing the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health, while empathy and coping style affected the perceived impact on the economy. The Covid-19 pandemic is a worldwide emergency in terms of psychological, social, and economic consequences. Our data suggests that in the Italian population, actual differences in individual perception of the Covid-19 outbreak severity for health are dramatically modulated by psychosocial frailty (i.e., distress and loneliness). At the same time, problem-oriented coping strategies and enhanced empathic abilities increase people's awareness of the severity of the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on economics. There is an immediate need for consensus guidelines and healthcare policies to support interventions aimed to manage psychosocial distress and increase population resilience towards the imminent crisis. © Copyright © 2020 Cerami, Santi, Galandra, Dodich, Cappa, Vecchi and Crespi. coping abilities; Covid-19 outbreak; distress; economic crisis; empathy; loneliness; perceived impact on health; psychosocial frailty adult; aged; Article; awareness; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; distress syndrome; economic aspect; economic crisis; empathy; epidemic; female; human; Italian (citizen); Italy; loneliness; major clinical study; male; perception; psychosocial care; risk factor; social isolation; young adult ECMO use in COVID-19: Lessons from past respiratory virus outbreaks - A narrative review The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to grow exponentially in most countries, posing an unprecedented burden on the healthcare sector and the world economy. Previous respiratory virus outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic H1N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), have provided significant insights into preparation and provision of intensive care support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Many patients have already been supported with ECMO during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and it is likely that many more may receive ECMO support, although, at this point, the role of ECMO in COVID-19-related cardiopulmonary failure is unclear. Here, we review the experience with the use of ECMO in the past respiratory virus outbreaks and discuss potential role for ECMO in COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).

A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including patient quarantine and mass “social distancing” measures. Although the clinical manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide. Given the clinical insights into CoVID-19 and the challenges presented in this review for the U.S. rural population, mitigation strategies should be designed accordingly to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this contagion. © 2020 by the authors.

Based on Granger test, questionnaire survey, enterprise research and expert interview, the overall impacts of shipping and port industry were evaluated. Focusing on different market segments, the different impacts on ports, containers, tankers, dry bulk cargoes, cruise ships and other subdivisions were evaluated. Combined with the current difficulties of the shipping and port industry, major countermeasures were put forward. Research result shows that the COVID-19 epidemic has taken a severe recession on global economy, trade and industry, and has been transmitted to the shipping industry by global supply chains. There is a strong Granger causal relationship between the COVID-19 daily new cases and the Baltic Dry Index. In the first quarter of 2020, the throughput of cargo and containers of main monitored ports in China were 105 353×104 t and 3 766.6×104 TEU, respectively, and year-on-year decrease by 3.5% and 8.6%, respectively. The epidemic has a greater short-term impact on dry bulk cargo, containers and oil tankers. In February 2020, the throughput of the eight major container hub ports declined by 19.8% year-on-year, and cruise passenger transport was hit by the overall closure. The recovery will be a slow process, and the COVID-19 epidemic will continue to have a negative impact on the shipping and port industry. It is suggested that some measures are put forward such as strengthening overseas port policy and port linking tracking, avoiding ship charter disputes and legal risks, improving the system of prevention and control of cruise ships, and promoting the development of smart ports and smart shipping. 3 tabs, 8 figs, 32 refs. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

The dialysis population is vulnerable and the dialysis facility is critical in maintaining operations and avoiding disease transmission. The present information regarding the clinical features of COVID-19 infection in the dialysis population was collected, and the useful measures of COVID-19 infection prevention and infection control in the dialysis facilities were summarized. Leadership, education, preparedness, management, and recovery phase were determined to be the critical procedures. It is hoped this updated interim review might provide information for medical professionals to take proactive action to best prepare and mitigate damage when facing the COVID-19 pandemic challenge. © 2020 The Authors.

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World. Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings. Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality. Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks. The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics. Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered. The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only. COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918–1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India. The present study review is on the general continent, virology, pathogenesis, global epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19 with the reference to India. © 2020, Indian Virological Society.

Despite all resources employed to counteract the spreading of the virus, additional global strategies are needed to handle the related mental health issues. Methods: Published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak and other previous global infections have been considered and reviewed. Comments: This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally. Collective concerns influence daily behaviors, economy, prevention strategies and decision-making from policy makers, health organizations and medical centers, which can weaken strategies of COVID-19 control and lead to more morbidity and mental health needs at global level. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus; COVID-19; mental health; Outbreak Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; global health; human; mental health; pandemic; pathogenicity; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Automated detection of COVID-19 cases using deep neural networks with X-ray images The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019), which first appeared in Wuhan city of China in December 2019, spread rapidly around the world and became a pandemic. It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Chest X-ray images; Coronavirus (COVID-19); Deep learning; Radiology images Diagnosis; Imaging techniques; Object detection; Viruses; Automated detection; Binary classification; Chest X-ray image; Classification accuracy; Devastating effects; Multi-class classification; Object detection systems; Radiological imaging; Deep neural networks; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; artificial intelligence; binary classification; computer assisted diagnosis; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; feature extraction; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiclass classification; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; biology; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; factual database; lung; pandemic; pneumonia; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Computational Biology; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted Valuation of air pollution externalities: comparative assessment of economic damage and emission reduction under COVID-19 lockdown Air pollution (AP) is one of the major causes of health risks as it leads to widespread morbidity and mortality each year. Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities—Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2, and SO2 are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities. This helps in understanding the magnitude of actual damage and brings out a more holistic picture of the damages related to lockdown. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Although there are a number of issues to be considered, the following points are most urgent: The potential for domesticated (companion) animals to serve as a reservoir of infection contributing to continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread. The ramifications to food security, economy, and trade issues should coronavirus establish itself within livestock and poultry. The disruption to national security if SARS-CoV-2 and its fairly well-established effects on smell (hyposmia/anosmia) to critical military service animals including explosive detector dog, narcotics detector dog, specialized search dog, combat tracker dog, mine detection dog, tactical explosive detector dog, improvised explosive device detector dog, patrol explosive detector dog, and patrol narcotics detector dog, as well as multipurpose canines used by special operations such as used by the U.S. customs and border protection agency (e.g., Beagle Brigade). This article presents in chronological order data that both individually (as received independently from multiple countries) and collectively urge studies that elucidate the following questions. What animal species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the likely sources of infection, the period of infectivity, and transmissibility between these animals and to other animal species and humans? What are the best diagnostic tests currently available for companion animals and livestock? What expressions of illness in companion and other animal species can serve as disease markers? Although it is recognized that robust funding and methodology need to be identified to apply the best scientific investigation into these issues, there may be easily identifiable opportunities to capture information that can guide decision and study. First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers. If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created. Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, although companion animals and zoo species have repeatedly served as sentinels for emerging infectious diseases, they do not currently fall under the jurisdiction of any federal agency and are not under surveillance. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020. companion animals; coronavirus; COVID-19; livestock anosmia; beagle; coronavirus disease 2019; detection dog; dog; domestic animal; human; hyposmia; lethargy; livestock; needs assessment; nonhuman; pandemic; population density; poultry; priority journal; research; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus infectivity; virus transmission; zoonosis; animal; Betacoronavirus; bird disease; Coronavirus infection; dog disease; history; laboratory technique; livestock; needs assessment; pandemic; pathology; pet animal; smelling disorder; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Dog Diseases; Dogs; History, 21st Century; Humans; Livestock; Needs Assessment; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Pets; Pneumonia, Viral; Poultry Diseases; Zoonoses Harnessing the power of novel animal-free test methods for the development of COVID-19 drugs and vaccines The COVID-19-inducing virus, SARS-CoV2, is likely to remain a threat to human health unless efficient drugs or vaccines become available. Given the extent of the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches. © 2020, The Author(s).  antivirus agent; virus vaccine; antivirus agent; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; combination drug therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; drug approval; drug development; drug efficacy; drug quality; drug repositioning; drug research; drug safety; Editorial; European Medicines Agency; genotoxicity; investment; new (animal free) approach method; priority journal; quality control; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal testing alternative; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug development; human; pandemic; preclinical study; procedures; virus pneumonia; Animal Testing Alternatives; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Development; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines Biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus COVID-19 The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to the international health system and economy. This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750,890 people worldwide, resulting in 36,405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender over 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R2 = 0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing, and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics. © 2020 The Authors 2019-nCoV; Biological trends; Coronavirus; Covid-2019; Outbreak; Prevalence  Artificial intelligence in the agri-food system: Rethinking sustainable business models in the COVID-19 scenario The aim of the paper is to investigate the artificial intelligence (AI) function in agri-food industry, as well as the role of stakeholders in its supply chain. Above all, from the beginning of the new millennium, scholars and practitioners have paid an increasing attention to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in operational processes management and challenges for new business models, in a sustainable and socially responsible perspective. Thus, the stakeholders can assume a proactive or marginal role in the value creation for business, according to their own environmental awareness. These issues appear still ""open"" in some industries, such as the agri-food system, where the adoption of new technologies requires rethinking and redesigning the whole business model. Methodologically, we brought forward an in-depth review of the literature about major articles in this field. Especially, the study has been conducted following two phases: firstly, we extracted from scientific databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) and studied relevant articles; secondly, we analyzed the selected articles. The findings highlight interesting issues about AI towards a ""space economy"" to achieve sustainable and responsible business models, also in the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

An Explorative Cross-country Study Based on Select Indicators In this article, we analyse the factors that determine the fatality rates across 29 economies spread across both the developing and developed world. Recent emerging literature and expert opinions in popular media have indicated various factors that may explain cross-country difference in fatality rates. These factors range from access to public health infrastructure, BCG vaccination policies, demographic structure, restrictive policy interventions and the weather. In addition, articles are examining different kinds of fatality rates that can be explained. Progressing beyond fragmented databases and anecdotal evidence, we have developed a database for such factors, have explored various econometric models to test the explanatory power of these factors in explaining several kinds of fatality rates. Based on available data, our study reveals that factors such as public health system, population age structure, poverty level and BCG vaccination are powerful contributory factors in determining fatality rates. Interactions between factors such as poverty level and BCG vaccination provide interesting insights into the complex interplay of factors.

The Spanish Flu of 1918, which was the last pandemic that had a similar impact, was shadowed under the consequences of World War I. All the brilliance, strength and economies of countries worldwide are aimed at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The knowledge about coronavirus dynamics, its nature and epidemiology are expanding every day. The present review aims to summarize the structure, epidemiology, symptoms, statistical status of the disease status, intervention strategies and deliberates the lessons learnt during the pandemic. The intervention approaches, antiviral drug repurposing and vaccine trials are intensified now. Statistical interpretations of disease dynamics and their projections may help the decision-makers. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2  Recessions and Health: The Long-Term Health Consequences of Responses to the Coronavirus* The lockdown measures that were implemented in the spring of 2020 to stop the spread of COVID-19 are having a huge impact on economies in the UK and around the world. In addition to the direct impact of COVID-19 on health, the following recession will have an impact on people's health outcomes. This paper reviews economic literature on the longer-run health impacts of business-cycle fluctuations and recessions. Previous studies show that an economic downturn, which affects people through increased unemployment, lower incomes and increased uncertainty, will have significant consequences on people's health outcomes both in the short and longer term. The health effects caused by these adverse macroeconomic conditions will be complex and will differ across generations, regions and socio-economic groups. Groups that are vulnerable to poor health are likely to be hit hardest even if the crisis hit all individuals equally, and we already see that some groups such as young workers and women are worse hit by the recession than others. Government policies during and after the pandemic will play an important role in determining the eventual health consequences. © 2020 The Authors.

No proven effective antiviral therapy or vaccine currently exists, and supportive care remains to be the cornerstone treatment. Through previous lessons learned from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV studies, scientific groups worldwide have rapidly expanded the knowledge pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 virology that includes in vitro and in vivo models for testing of antiviral therapies and randomized clinical trials. In the present narrative, we review SARS-CoV-2 virology, clinical features, pathophysiology, and animal models with a specific focus on the antiviral and adjunctive therapies currently being tested or that require testing in animal models and randomized clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors.

However, due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal is not only going to lose a significant portion of remittances but will also face the Herculean task of creating employment for the workforce who may return to Nepal. This paper discusses sustainable options for the Nepali government to help create employment for its citizens in Nepal through the revitalization of fallow lands and other potential agricultural areas, which are below a 15° slope. The land-use and land-cover data for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are derived from the classification of satellite images. These classified and resampled 30 m × 30 m images along with the 30 × 30 m elevation data are brought to the Kibana Platform within the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to analyze the status of land-use and-cover conditions for the 1980 to 2010 period within nine different slope classes at an interval of 5° slope. Our findings suggest there have been massive conversions of forested areas for agricultural land at lower slope areas between 1980 and 2000, but the trend began to reverse from 2000 to 2010 as trees started coming back to the fallow agricultural lands. This happened mainly because, during the countrywide Maoist insurgency period (1996–2006), many youth first took shelter in various urban centers away from their natal homes and then emigrated to foreign countries for remittance purposes. As a result, many farmlands became fallow and barren, and agricultural productivity decreased. Consequently, Nepal, an exporter of rice and pulses until the late 1980s, started importing food grain each year. The major goals of this research are to explore: (a) if Nepal can self-sustain in agricultural products by utilizing potential agricultural lands below a 15° slope in various geographic regions; (b) the means for productively engaging the youth returning to the country; and (c) methods of reinvigorating the ecosystem services of Nepal to support sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

In this overview accompanying the Special Issue of Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews, we examine some of the many social and scientific issues impacted by SARS-CoV2 – personal lives, economy, scientific communication, the environment. International members of Istituto Pasteur in Rome and INITIATE, the Marie Curie Training Network reflect on the lasting global impact of the coronavirus pandemic. © 2020 Covid-19; global pandemic; SARS-CoV2; scientific response Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease burden; economic aspect; environmental factor; Europe; financial deficit; human; immunopathogenesis; infection control; mental disease; misinformation; morbidity; mortality; pandemic; priority journal; quarantine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social aspect; social distance; Western Hemisphere; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; pandemic; pathogenicity; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Distance Inter-country distancing, globalisation and the coronavirus pandemic Originating in China, the coronavirus has reached the world at different speeds and levels of strength. This paper provides an initial understanding of some driving factors and their consequences. Since transmission requires people, the human factor behind globalisation is essential. Globalisation, a major force behind global well-being and equality, is highly associated with this factor. The analysis investigates the impact globalisation has on the speed of initial transmission to a country and on the scale of initial infections in the context of other driving factors. Our cross-country analysis finds that measures of globalisation are positively related to the spread of the virus, both in speed and in scale. However, the study also finds that globalised countries are better equipped to keep fatality rates low. The conclusion is not to reduce globalisation to avoid pandemics, but to better monitor the human factor at the outbreak and mobilise collaboration forces to curtail diseases. © 2020 The Authors.

This thesis was particularly confirmed by the global events of the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, when the spread of the COVID-19 virus revealed the helplessness of humanity in the face of a pandemic. Only intensive scientific work, having an interdisciplinary character, gives hope to stop the development of the spread of the virus. It turned out that it is scientists who are necessary to reduce mortality and morbidity, as well as the negative effects of a pandemic on the economy and public health. In this regard, it is worth discussing whether the scientific work of scientists is satisfying for them? Nowadays, the scientist is demanded for immediate effects of scientific research, implementation of inventions tailored to the emerging needs, and quick solutions to the problems of a dynamically changing society. However, along with the growing social expectations towards researchers, is their work increasingly appreciated? The aim of this article is getting to assess the level of satisfaction with scientific work among researchers and to identify the factors that influence its level. The article presents the results of research conducted on a random sample of 763 academics from Poland. The conducted scientific studies have established that: (1) The level of satisfaction of researchers concerning their own scientific work depends on employment conditions, as well as the social significance of the research carried out, (2) the level of satisfaction from work is closely correlated with the scientific opportunities of researchers (that is, the possibility of academic and didactic work, contact with students and co-workers) and negatively correlated with the necessity to carry out administrative work, and (3) the majority of Polish researchers are proud of their scientific achievements and treat their profession as a passion or vocation. © 2020 by the authors.

Their infectious nature is one of the main reasons for the probable health impacts. The COVID-19 crisis that is presently affecting all countries around the world is a true testament to the characteristic nature of a virus. We have already seen the disastrous nature of this virus affecting millions of people and its capacity to ruin the global economy. So, the rush of the hour is to find prompt diagnosis and effective treatment for achieving virus control and its total elimination. The current development of nanomaterials with its unique features and functions has brought out a chain of applications and technologies that could curb this crisis. In this article, we will review the literature already existing and provide a summary of the current developments of nanoparticles proposed that are presently under extensive research and clinical trials that are predicted to considerably improve the COVID-19 crisis. © (2020) Society for Biomaterials & Artificial Organs #20041120  Clinical research; Nanoparticles; Clinical trial; Global economies; Health impact; Human health; Unique features; Viruses Modeling the Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Regional Industry Risk Contagion [新冠肺炎疫情影响下区域产业网络风险传导效应研究] The outbreak and rapid spread of Covid-19 epidemic have brought severe challenges to the regional economy of China. The epidemic has led to interruptions in supply and decline in demand in some industries, causing supply chain risk spread through the industry chain to the entire network, which is very likely to trigger systemic risks. In order to simulate the risk contagion effect of the regional industrial supply chain under the influence of the epidemic, a network cascading failure model based on China's regional industrial network is proposed. We simulate the propagation of production suspension and liquidity risk in the case of unexpected interruption of supply and decline in demand in Hubei province as well as the rest part of China. The results show that risk propagation exhibits an abrupt transition with a critical time point. The risk spread is relatively slow and stable before the critical point. Once the critical point is exceeded, the accelerated spread makes the entire industrial network blackout in a short period. We also show that under the impact of supply-side and demand-side shocks, different industries have heterogeneous effects on systemic risk levels. re industrial network blackout in a short period. We also show that different industries have heterogeneous impact on systemic risk of the industry network under shocks from supply and demand side. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

This is of particular concern for nations with weaker health systems. This article reports the response of a comprehensive cancer centre in a lower-middle income country to prevent COVID-19 transmission and how the implementation of pragmatic strategies have served as a springboard to improve cancer services beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies included establishment of a local taskforce, increased education and facilitation of good hygiene practices, staff training, patient triaging, improved patient scheduling, remote review of patients and establishing a virtual platform for meetings. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.

We discuss the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental effects of shuttering the tournament and suggest that an understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to bring about an alternative, more sustainable sports tourism economy. The cancellation of March Madness resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in tourism revenue for local economies and deprived traveler-fans of pilgrimages to arenas, important socio-cultural gathering spaces for American basketball fans. However, it also prevented the emission of a sizable quantity of greenhouse gasses based on our carbon footprint calculated from the previous year’s tournament. Ultimately, from the disruptive closing down of sport and event tourism, a post-pandemic sports tourism landscape should emerge that takes more seriously the triple-bottom line notion of balancing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the creation and maintenance of resilient local economies all while both acknowledging the important role sport plays in society and keeping tourism actors healthy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. carbon footprint; coronavirus; COVID-19; local economies; sport; Sustainable tourism COVID-19; economic impact; epidemic; health status; respiratory disease; sport; sustainability; tourism economics; tourism market; viral disease; United States; Coronavirus Catch-22 with COVID-19: Health or economy? [краткое описание не найдено]   Highlight of Immune Pathogenic Response and Hematopathologic Effect in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-Cov-2 Infection A sudden outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, China in December 2019 quickly grew into a global pandemic, putting at risk not only the global healthcare system, but also the world economy. As the disease continues to spread rapidly, the development of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches is urgently required. Although some progress has been made in understanding the viral structure and invasion mechanism of coronaviruses that may cause severe cases of the syndrome, due to the limited understanding of the immune effects caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is difficult for us to prevent patients from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the major complications of coronavirus infection. Therefore, any potential treatments should focus not only on direct killing of coronaviruses and prevention strategies by vaccine development, but also on keeping in check the acute immune/inflammatory responses, resulting in ARDS and PF. In addition, potential treatments currently under clinical trials focusing on killing coronaviruses or on developing vaccines preventing coronavirus infection largely ignore the host immune response. However, taking care of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with ARDS and PF is considered to be the major difficulty. Therefore, further understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important for clinical resolution and saving medication cost. In addition to a breif overview of the structure, infection mechanism, and possible therapeutic approaches, we summarized and compared the hematopathologic effect and immune responses to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also discussed the indirect immune response caused by SARS and direct infection, replication, and destroying of immune cells by MERS-CoV. The molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection-induced lymphopenia or cytokine storm may provide some hint toward fight against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. This may provide guidance over using immune therapy as a combined treatment to prevent patients developing severe respiratory syndrome and largely reduce complications. © Copyright © 2020 Liang, Wang, Chien, Yarmishyn, Yang, Lai, Luo, Lin, Chen, Chang and Chiou. hematopathologic effect; immune responses; immune therapy; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; hemagglutinin; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; interferon; interleukin 2; interleukin 7; M protein; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; membrane protein; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nucleocapsid protein; tumor necrosis factor; virus envelope protein; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amino terminal sequence; antibody response; antigen presenting cell; apoptosis; B lymphocyte; carboxy terminal sequence; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; cryoelectron microscopy; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; dendritic cell; electron tomography; Feline coronavirus; hematopathology; hemophagocytic syndrome; histone modification; human; humoral immunity; immune response; inflammation; innate immunity; lung fibrosis; macrophage; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; monocyte; nonhuman; pathology; protein motif; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; upregulation; virus load; virus morphology; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; pathology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Inflammation; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Virus Replication Rationality Analysis of the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with Reduning Injection [热毒宁注射液的快速卫生技术评估及其应用于新型冠状病毒肺炎的药学分析和监护] OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and rationality of Reduning injection in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Through consulting, summarizing and analyzing literatures, the rapid HTA evaluation of Reduning was carried out, and its pharmacological rationality and drug monitoring for COVID-19 were discussed. RESULTS: Literature analysis indicated that COVID-19 belongs to the pestilence of TCM. It was characterized by “dampness, heat, deficiency, toxin and stasis”, and its clinical manifestations involved inflammatory factor storm, immune system damage, etc. Reduning injection was approved to the treatment of influenza, cough and respiratory tract infections caused by exopathic wind-heat, and a typical drug for heat-clearing and detoxifying. CONCLUSION: The rapid HTA evaluation showed that Reduning injection has good safety, effectiveness and economy. The mechanisms of Reduning in antipyretic and anti-inflammatory, immune regulation and anti-virus suggest the rationality of Reduning in treating COVID-19, but drug monitoring should be done well in the use process.

In this survey, we examine the impact of the outbreak on the Indonesian economy, as well as the government’s response to the public health crisis and its provisions for the emerging economic crisis. Indonesia’s delay in responding to the health crisis while Covid-19 spread in neighbouring countries in January–February 2020 has been costly for the health of the population. The government’s policy responses have so far been aimed at steadying the ship, addressing both the needs of the poor and the potentially poor (vulnerable) groups. At the time of writing, Covid-19 had not been tamed in Indonesia by any means. Hence, its implications for economic growth, jobs and welfare remained uncertain, as policy discussions were all about opening up the economy from virus-imposed restrictions across the country, under what has been termed the ‘new normal’. © 2020 ANU Indonesia Project.

Being a close relative of Bat corona-virus, SARS and MERS it’s structural and sequence similarity has abled scientists for repurposing of popular drugs like hydroxychloroquine, cloroquine and also scavenging for lead molecules by in-silico and in-vivo or in-vitro approach. The potent drug targets are ACE2; spike protein binding receptor to host cell surface, Mpro; proteo-lytic polyprotein processing enzymes needed for virion maturation and RdRp; RNA dependent RNA polymerase needed for RNA replication. The recent trend focuses on the fact that cocktail of anti-corona virus treatment will be available soon by broad spectrum antiviral compounds. It takes time to develop such drug targets till then social distancing and following of hygiene are the only way to thrive well. This article incorporates the present World scenario related to COVID infection, focuses on its origin and also future possibilities for a COVID free future. © The Author(s) 2020.

In this paper, a structural equation (SEM) model was proposed to compare risk knowledge, risk perception, risk aversion attitudes and behavioral intentions towards rural tourism. According to the empirical results, there was a large proportion of tourists showing preference for rural tourism recently. Potential participants in rural tourism paid most attention to the performance realization and time cost of scenic spots, while the psycho-social risk posed by COVID-19 had little impact. The inherent risk nature of risk aversion attitudes made knowledge of the pneumonia risk less effective in reducing tourists’ intentions, while knowledge of the pneumonia risk was more effective in alleviating the risk perception that potential tourists have towards rural tourism. With regard to travel intention and recommendation intention of rural tourism, the negative impacts of risk aversion attitude were more considerable compared to risk perception. Meanwhile, the parallel mediating effect of risk perception and risk aversion attitude in rural tourism needed to be taken into consideration together. © 2020 by the authors.

Drawing principally on current evidence for the UK, as well as lessons from the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak and the 2007/8 financial crises, it outlines the likely key demand and supply effects, paying attention to the situation for agriculture as well as discussing the implications for rural communities. A distinction is made between the effects on businesses offering goods and services for out-of-home as opposed to in-home consumption. Gendered dimensions are also noted as likely business and household strategies for coping and adaptation. The paper concludes with a brief mapping of a research agenda for studying the longer-term effects of COVID-19 on rural economies. © 2020 by the authors.

Most zoonotic disease pandemics, including COVID-19, arise from the unsustainable exploitation of nature. This special editorial provides a snapshot of how protected and conserved areas around the world are being impacted by COVID-19. For many protected and conserved areas, negative impacts on management capacity, budgets and effectiveness are significant, as are impacts on the livelihoods of communities living in and around these areas. We provide a commentary on how effectively and equitably managed systems of protected and conserved areas can be part of a response to the pandemic that both lessens the chance of a recurrence of similar events and builds a more sustainable future for people and nature. We conclude the editorial with a Call for Action for the rescue, recovery, rebuilding and expansion of the global network of protected and conserved areas. © 2020, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

As it spreads across the world, it has overwhelmed health care systems, strangled the global economy, and led to a devastating loss of life. Widespread efforts from regulators, clinicians, and scientists are driving a rapid expansion of knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. The authors review the most current data, with a focus on the basic understanding of the mechanism(s) of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutics. The authors discuss the basic virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, multiorgan consequences, and outcomes. With a focus on cardiovascular complications, they propose several mechanisms of injury. The virology and potential mechanism of injury form the basis for a discussion of potential disease-modifying therapies. © 2020 cardiovascular; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; treatments; virology angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antiinflammatory agent; azithromycin; camostat; chloroquine; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; neutralizing antibody; nucleotide derivative; proteinase inhibitor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine; siltuximab; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus vaccine; acute coronary syndrome; cardiogenic shock; cardiologist; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart injury; heart muscle injury; human; infection control; kidney injury; life cycle; liver injury; membrane fusion; mortality; myocarditis; nonhuman; oxygen supply; patient care; resource allocation; respiratory failure; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; takotsubo cardiomyopathy; thrombosis; viral genetics; virology; virus genome; virus morphology; virus transmission Avaliacao de tecnologias em saude: Tensoes metodologicas durante a pandemia de Covid-19 Covid-19 is a global threat that attracts researchers from all areas to understand the natural history of the disease and its epidemiological parameters. The technological development of vaccines, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic targets has mobilized many resources in a short time. Health technology assessment (HTA), based on a systematic analysis of the properties, effects and/or impacts of health technologies through internationally-validated methods and instruments to assess the quality and methodological rigor of studies that demonstrate effectiveness, efficacy, and safety, is under unprecedented pressure due to the pandemic. This article also reflects on the emergency authorization of the use of treatments and diagnostic tests that conflict with HTA precepts. We will also evaluate non-pharmacological technologies of containment of the disease and their impacts on the domestic and international economy, as well as the judicial interventions that impact the decisions of managers in the exceptional context of the covid-19 pandemic. © 2020 Instituto de Estudos Avancados da Universidade de Sao Paulo.

This has been communicated in a transparent manner. Small groups of young(er) people of up to approximately 50 individuals are subject to a bigger risk of infection than others. The objective of this paper is to make a case for the argument, that alongside herd-immunity, Sweden is using the social science originated planning approach: backcasting. The government has not been transparent on backcasting. The authors present the use of backcasting only as an argument based on available data and authors' reasoning. A backcasting exercise for the case of the Swedish economy is constructed. This frame outlines five interdependent levels with which a national economy can apply what this paper calls a backcasting herd-immunity approach in its COVID-19 policy. The authors further suggest how it is possible to use social science, natural science and political ideology as complementary in COVID-19 mitigation in particular and in sustainability strategies in general. © 2020 by the authors.

We are not only in a “pandemic” but also an “infodemic”. Health literacy is more important than ever in the face of these global health threats, which have impacted outcomes across the levels of the socio-ecological model (SEM), including individual health behaviors, family relationships, organizational behavior, state policy-making, national mortality statistics, and the international economy in the span of weeks. Our special issue sought to pull together interdisciplinary threads guided by two principles. The first was defining health literacy as essential skills and situational resources needed for people to find, understand, evaluate, communicate, and use information and services in a variety of forms across various settings throughout their life course to promote health and wellbeing. The second was the idea that enhancing health literacy in populations and systems is critical to achieving health equity. In this time of public health need across traditional borders, the inter-sectoral and international perspectives of special issue articles are more urgent than ever. A greater understanding, appreciation, and application of health literacy can support policy action on multiple levels to address major public health challenges. Health literacy should be built deliberately as a population-level resource and community asset. We have summarized the set of articles in this special issue across the levels of the SEM, hoping their thoughtful considerations and interesting findings will help to support global health and wellness and inspire future research, policy, and practice in this global public health emergency and beyond. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the global effect of this pandemic has been devastating. Billions of people are in lockdown and isolation on six continents around the world. Most have easy access to information due to internet connectivity and electronic media, which has helped share information about the pandemic. However, information overload during the current COVID-19 pandemic has posed a set of challenges not encountered before. There is an ""infodemic"" in which false news, conspiracy theories, magical cures and racist news are being shared at an alarming rate, with the potential to increase anxiety and stress and even lead to loss of life. This review highlights some of these challenges and suggests general measures to avoid information overload and infodemic in the connected world of 21st century. © 2020 Pakistan Medical Association.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 2019-CoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; potential interventions; SARS alpha tocopherol; antivirus agent; ascorbic acid; chloroquine; cinanserin; cyclosporine; diarylheptanoid derivative; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; emodin; flavonoid; immunoglobulin; interferon; iron; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monoclonal antibody; nelfinavir; nicotianamine; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; promazine; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; retinol; ribavirin; selenium; thymopentin; thymosin alpha1; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin B group; zinc; COVID-19; immunologic factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trace element; virus vaccine; vitamin; antiviral therapy; China; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; diet therapy; human; infection control; nonhuman; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus infection; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; nutritional status; passive immunization; pathogenicity; plasma; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Immunologic Factors; Nutritional Status; Plasma; Pneumonia, Viral; Trace Elements; Viral Vaccines; Vitamins Novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A lesson from animal coronaviruses The recent pandemic caused by the novel human coronavirus, referrred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), not only is having a great impact on the health care systems and economies in all continents but it is also causing radical changes of common habits and life styles. The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown. However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features. A full comprehension of the mechanisms driving the evolution of animal CoVs will help better understand the emergence, spreading, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 The Authors Animal coronaviruses; COVID-19; Genetic plasticity; Host switch; Novel human coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Tissue tropism case report; clinical article; comprehension; coronavirus disease 2019; human; nonhuman; review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tropism; animal; Betacoronavirus; classification; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus infection; disease model; genetics; isolation and purification; molecular evolution; pandemic; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Zoonoses COVID-19 and its initial signalling effects on the stock market in India India’s economy is highly integrated with world economy.

The Indonesia wellbeing priest had likewise created a ruckus with his open proclamation on the COVID-19 when he urged the individuals to depend on 'petition' as a preventive mark as he ticked off the individuals who purchased covers at a more significant expense. Actually, the COVID-19 episode has in truth devastatingly affected Indonesia's economy, particularly the movement and the travel industry segment. The marvel of agreement marriage is a typical wonder that happens in the Southeast Asian area. The act of agreement relationships is as of now predominant in a few Southeast Asian nations, for example, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. In Indonesia, the act of agreement relationships happens in a few locales, for example, West Java, Central Java and East Java and Kalimantan which are completed by remote men from the Middle East. This has become upsides and downsides among Indonesian individuals. Already, Saudi sex searchers hit Thailand during the 80s . In 1989, when relations between the two nations experienced issues brought about by a case called ""blue jewel business"", the Government of Saudi Arabia disallowed its residents from visiting Thailand. Subsequently, visitors from Saudi Arabia and followed by different sightseers from the Gulf nations made a beeline for Indonesia. © 2020 SERSC. Corona virus; Halal sex; Sex tourism; Temporary marriage  Origin, potential therapeutic targets and treatment for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) The ongoing episode of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has imposed a serious threat to global health and the world economy. The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat. According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology. The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future. At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19. The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies. In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions. © 2020 by the authors.

So far, 136 reports from the WHO were reported. In the latest report, 6416828 patients in almost all countries have been infected with the COVID-19. The present study discusses the different aspects of COVID such as emergence, signs and symptoms, comparisons with SARS and MERS, concerns, governments' actions in controlling the virus and a descriptive analysis of the spread and death. The emergence of the coronavirus family in the last two decades has created a public health issue around the world. It has also caused serious damages to infrastructure, economy, culture and communities of countries. Thus, affected governments have taken steps to reduce these concerns such as quarantine, education, traffic control, closure of recreational centers, reduction of working hours etc. Despite strict measures to contain the COVID-19, this virus is still expanding and the question of ""what actions should be taken with what political package?"" is being asked. To answer this question, it is important to understand the process of disease occurrence and modeling different interventions on changing the natural course of the disease is very important. © Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Anesthesiology Research Center.

Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. Objective: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter's search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (""corona,"" ""2019-nCov,"" and ""COVID-19""), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. Results: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). Conclusions: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Work from home (WFH) has become the norm, especially for service organizations. Following government instructions, even the academic institutions had to shut down temporarily, affecting academic delivery. Thus, they had to find new alternatives to academic delivery, and virtual classes were the way forward. In the present paper, we attempted to study the impact of lockdown on the teaching – learning process. The objective of the study was to assess the adoption rate for virtual classes and to determine the various benefits, challenges, and reasons for non-adoption of virtual classes. The study considered responses from 341 teachers of higher education institutions (HEIs) of Ghaziabad region. The study was divided into two parts. One set of respondents were those who adopted virtual classrooms and another set that did not adopt virtual classrooms. Descriptive statistics and t-test were performed to analyze the data collected through primary sources. Among those who adopted virtual mode, the mean of actual benefits was significantly less than the mean of expected benefits. Network issues, lack of training, and lack of awareness were stated to be the major challenges faced by them. Lack of awareness was stated to be the most important reason by those who did not adopt virtual classrooms followed by lack of interest and doubts regarding the usefulness of virtual classes. Less attendance, lack of personal touch, and lack of interaction due to connectivity issues were found to be the significant drawbacks of virtual classes. The study also suggested the ways to overcome the above challenges, drawbacks, and reasons behind non-adoption of virtual classes. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The simple good personal hygiene and physical distancing measures were identified as one of the most effective protections against COVID 19. The Indian way of living has many scientific principles inherited in it to combat infectious diseases. We follow the Sanatan Sanskriti concepts traditionally, sometimes not even realizing the rationale behind it. This article tries to explore the correlation between the preventive measures and our traditional Sanatan practices. The pandemic has shaken the globe and time has come to rethink and move back to basics of our ancient traditions for a sustainable future. There is a need to promote our cultural practices and avoid running behind the ultra-modern ways of living so that the world learns to combat and live with the COVID 19. © 2020, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine.

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

But the medium-term growth outlook is more uncertain. Much depends on the policy response - a strong and well-designed response could contain the medium-term output losses, but large and enduring damage is a risk. ▪ Growth patterns after significant GDP declines vary. Historical evidence points to large upfront effects from pandemics and natural disasters, but the medium-term outcomes are mixed, with policy responses a crucial determinant. Longer recessions and financial crises tend to lead to weaker medium-term growth. ▪ The coronavirus may trigger annual GDP declines among the worst seen in the last 100 years. Economies can bounce back sharply after such declines, but our analysis suggests output losses also endure in a significant number of cases. ▪ The US interwar experience shows the danger of allowing financial distress to snowball and exacerbate GDP declines. The weakness of medium-term growth after the global financial crisis confirms the long-term impact of such distress. ▪ A key risk for the medium term is that firms and/or households react to the coronavirus recession and disruption by raising savings, accelerating a shift toward ‘Japanification’ of major economies. ▪ Our baseline forecasts envisage moderate medium-term output losses due to coronavirus, in part reflecting rapid and large-scale policy interventions. But uncertainty around this forecast is significant and considerable variation is possible across economies. © Oxford Economics 2020  COVID-19; economic growth; economic impact; epidemic; financial crisis; Gross Domestic Product; viral disease; Coronavirus Management of pandemic crisis: COVID-19 The world is threatened with a novel corona virus (COVID-19) which has posed an unpredictable challenge to the public health workforce. It originated from the Wuhan City of China and spread across the globe creating havoc among the public and healthcare workers which led to WHO declaring it to be pandemic. Transmission of this virus is through symptomatic and asymp-tomatic patients in the form of fomites produced while coughing or sneez-ing. This has led to a global crisis subsequently leading to the scarce avail-ability of health care resources such as personal protective equipment, ven-tilators, ICU beds, medication. Healthcare workers have been a vital human resource in providing treatment and assistance to the infected patients though they were facing a high risk of themselves getting infected by the coronavirus. They suffered from fatigue, physical, and psychological violence as they tend to work for longer hours. Detection of infected patients was implemented, as the widely used RT-PCR method was accurate but took more time for the definite results. Hence, for quick results and to detect more number of infected patients, the rapid antigen test was conducted. Therefore, this virus has resulted in a greater impact on the economy and social development and this article of many infected countries. © 2020, J. K. Welfare and Pharmascope Foundation.

COVID-19; Crisis; Health Care Workers; Pandemic  A biography of coronaviruses from ibv to SARS-CoV-2, with their evolutionary paradigms and pharmacological challenges Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family (Coronaviridae) of viruses that cause respiratory disorders in birds and mammals. They were originally discovered as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens in the early 20th century. A group of related viruses subsequently discovered from mice and humans led to the collective naming as coronaviruses, as they were all characterized by a solar corona-like ring on their surface, called the spikes. The first known human CoVs were among viruses that cause common cold and considered as modest threats to human health. But the emergence of zoonotic CoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) during every recent past decade resulted in pandemics with loss of human lives. With no vaccine to prevent, and no drug to treat the infections, the miniscule viruses evolve into behemoths of plagues. SARS-CoV-2 with its infection, COVID-19, is particularly rampant and malicious and is bound to cause colossal impacts not only on human health but also on global economy. Understanding of their evolutionary strategies and pathogenic adaptions had given us fair warnings. Yet, the world was ill-prepared. This article highlights the scientific messages that could have mit-igated the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolutionary mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 and related CoVs that bely drug and vaccine development, and above all, the possible epidemics in the future. © 2020, J.

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen. © 2020, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

Mobile Money has grown significantly, especially post demonetization, enabled by 'smart devices' such as smartphones, smartwatches, smart cards, toll payment devices, and voice-enabled products deploying the Internet of Things (loT). The ease and simplicity of payments through IoT devices are set to change the shopping experience and consequently retail permanently. The government of India's Digital India program is further likely to transform the entire nation into a digitally enabled society as well as a knowledge economy. Mobile money is becoming an essential tool for financial inclusion to unite the unbanked communities of rural India. Internet was introduced in India in 1995, and the first wave of e-commerce began soon after that. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart solutions are noticeable in the growth of mobile payments in India in dual ways, firstly in reducing fraud in high-risk mobile payments and secondly in improved Peer to Peer (P2P) Payment Platforms. Mobile payments through AI solutions is just one illustration of technology that is broadly used today, and that has already started advancing the FinTech industry forward for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This embarks on a sound period of digital inclusion leading to mobile and internet connectivity, with the overall growth of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) networks in India. A dynamic force for next-generation e-commerce is the fast-multiplication of mobile phones, handheld computers, mobile devices and PDAs. Mobile commerce demonstrates a sea change in consumer behavior in India. This study aims to examine the growth and effect of mobile payments in India, where mobile penetration is the second highest in the world, after China. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the digital payments segment in India are noteworthy.. Like other economies of the world, the adverse effects of the pandemic are pervading to significant sectors of the Indian economy including retail trade, aviation, hospitality, entertainment industry, restaurants, clubs and entertainment parks. All of these sectors are experiencing the burden of the slowdown. In contrast, the digital payments sector comprising of groceries, online money transfer, Over The Top - OTT streaming media services, online gaming, online education is experiencing a boost. The government and RBI have asked banks to encourage their clients to use digital payment methods as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 IEEE.

COVID-19 was first reported in Indonesia on March 03, 2020 then rapidly spread to all 34 provinces by April 09, 2020. Since then, COVID-19 is declared a state of national disaster and health emergency. This research analyzes the difference of CO, HCHO, NO2, and SO2 density in Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi before and during the pandemic. Also, this study assesses the effect of large scale restrictions on the economic growth during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. In a nutshell, the results on Wilcoxon and Fisher test by significance level α=5% as well as odds ratio showed that there are significant differences of CO density in all regions with highest odds ratio in East Java (OR=9.07), significant differences of HCHO density in DKI Jakarta, East Java, and South Sulawesi. There are significant differences of NO2 density before and during public activities limitation in DKI Jakarta, West Java, East Java, and South Sulawesi. However, the results show that there are no significant differences of SO2 density in all regions. In addition, this research shows that there are significant differences of retail, grocery and pharmacy, and residental mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This research also shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic there are severe economic losses, industry, companies, and real disruptions are severe for all levels of life due to large scale restrictions. © 2020 GJESM.

In contrast to the existing studies, this research examines the effects of economic and social isolation as dimensions of globalization. The present paper allows underpinning the impact on the Chinese economic development of the isolation phenomenon as a consequence of coronavirus (COVID-19). To this end, annual time–frequency data is used to achieve the hypothesized claims. The study resolutions include (1) the existence of a long-run association between the outlined variables; (2) the long-run estimates suggest that the Chinese economy, over the investigated period, is inelastic to pollutant-driven economic growth; and (3) the Chinese isolation is less responsive to its economic growth while the country political willpower is elastic as demonstrated by a government commitment to dampen the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. This confinement is marked by the aggressive response by the government officials resolute by flattening the exponential impact of the pandemic. Based on these robust results, some far-reaching policy implications are underlined in the concluding remarks section. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Advances in medical science have failed in containing the onslaught of the virus. The world economy is on a downward spiral caused by the lockdowns imposed all over the globe both by developed and developing countries. International and domestic supply chains have been disrupted and almost all sectors of the economy have been reeling under the devastating effects of this crisis. This research study, based on secondary data, mainly focuses on four key areas of economy like Travel and Tourism, Crude oil, Food Security and Global job loss It highlights the various dimensions of the impact which the coronavirus has had on the world economy. It also discusses the various measures to be taken to overcome the adverse effects of the crisis caused by the pandemic. The findings of the study suggest that only collaborative planning and strategizing involving global leaders would result in creative solutions and meaningful interventions for helping the world economy to rebound and recover. © 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

One such partnership is a cause-related marketing campaign, where a business donates a portion of its sales to a nonprofit to address a social need. To help counter the devastating health and economic impact of COVID-19, this article briefly describes how small enterprise and nonprofit partnerships might implement local cause-related marketing campaigns focused on sustaining economic activity and slowing the spread of the pandemic. Successful campaigns may also enhance community self-reliance and reduce health inequities. Public policies and programs could encourage these private partnerships. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization cause-related marketing; community; COVID-19; development; nonprofit; small businesses  Estimates of dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and of its impact on the economy Economic growth forecasts have been revised downwards in most countries, but the incertitude regarding the duration or the evolution of the crisis persist. Under the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic expansion, today it is supposed that a huge global crisis will follow in all fields (humanitarian, social, economic). The pandemic impact is difficult to be evaluated until it stops or at least its peak will be reached. As a contribution to such work, we propose an estimation-simulation model, as an alternative to other models coming from probabilistic, genetic algorithms or other approaches. In order to analyse the dynamics of the spread of epidemic among the population, we built a model with differential equations for a special logistic time-function, which resulted in certain key-values and four phases of its evolution. Moreover, by simulating the daily dynamics of pandemic at three levels (world, EU, and Romania) we estimated the impact of pandemic on the economic growth until the end of this year. © 2020, Institute for Economic Forecasting.

A data-driven approach to model and forecast The pandemic shock puts the world on quarantine and paused economic operations that affected energy consumption and economic output. This study analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 shock on GDP, energy consumption, and climate change then forecasted the situation until 2032 using the system dynamic modeling approach. The outcomes reveal that the pandemic shock will decrease the growth by 1.3% in 2020 and 1.32% in 2021. The current shortfall, low energy consumption, and delay in completion of energy-related projects can reduce the GDP by 5.2% in 2020. The effect will penetrate the system and will cause further losses in the upcoming years. The energy consumption and quarantine situation will improve the climate situation and drop the average temperature by 0.049 and 0.021 oC in 2020 and 2021. The aggregate demand and supply side measures such as national spending, lowering the lending rate, and cuts in income taxes can help in diffusing the situation. The government should start operations on ongoing energy projects, give relaxation to SME’s with tight SOPs to secure jobs, and prevent possible GDP losses. The decline in oil prices provides an opportunity to cut fossil fuel subsidies and implement a carbon pricing mechanism. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

This article tries to provide an economic perspective of COVID-19 in India using some statistical figure of economic indicators. Analysis is based on the data collected for macro-economy, travel & tourism, transportation, stock market, human capital and trade. Finding revel that India could experience a health debacle at present and excruciating economic contraction in the near future if the government is unable to execute a proper policy framework. Based on the discussion, a few policy suggestions have been presented to counter both health and economic crisis. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd   A Comprehensive Review of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Role of IoT, Drones, AI, Blockchain, and 5G in Managing its Impact The unprecedented outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus, termed as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO), has placed numerous governments around the world in a precarious position. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its impact on the global economy. In drawing things to a close, we explore the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G, among others, to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak. © 2013 IEEE. 5G; AI; Blockchain; Coronavirus; COVID-19; global economic impact; IoMT applications; IoT; pandemic; transmission stages; UAVs for disaster management 5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Blockchain; Drones; Coronaviruses; Global economies; Health implications; Health-care system; Internet of thing (IOT); World Health Organization; Internet of things CovidGAN: Data Augmentation Using Auxiliary Classifier GAN for Improved Covid-19 Detection Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a viral disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN,the accuracy increased to 95%. We hope this method will speed up COVID-19 detection and lead to more robust systems of radiology. © 2013 IEEE.

However, specific investigation of industrial economies like Germany is not available. This provides us motivation to examine the association between environmental pollutants, climate indicators and the COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths in Germany using daily data from February 24, 2020, to July 02, 2020. The correlation analysis and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) approach are the analytical tools, which are used to explore the association between variables included in the study. Our findings indicate that PM2.5, O3, and NO2 have a significant relationship with the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, temperature is the only significant climate indicator which has significant correlation with the spread of COVID-19. Finally, PM10, humidity, and environmental quality index have a significant relationship only with the active cases from COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings conclude that Germany’s successful response to COVID-19 is attributed to environmental legislation and the medical care system, which oversaw significant overhaul after the SARS and MERS outbreaks. The current study implicates that other industrial economies, especially European economies, that are still facing COVID-19 outbreak can follow the German model for pandemic response. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The results of the study, carried out electronically from 1-15 April 2020, show that 77% of the technology companies that participated in the study changed their strategic communication planning during the first month of the state of alarm declared by the Spanish government on 14 March 2020. In 73% of cases, the strategy was proactive, although with a new orientation. The resulting mix of actions included preparing and disseminating digital content, sending press releases, organising digital events, generating internal communication and, to a lesser extent, advertising, following a strategy that combined 60% of owned media, 27% of earned media, and 13% of paid media. During the first month of the state of alarm in response to COVID-19, social media was the main communication channel for the digital companies that participated in the study, compared to print media, television, and radio. 30% of these communication actions used newsjacking techniques, tying their messages to the current situation of the pandemic. © 2020 Blanquerna School of Communication and International Relations.

As the sudden emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is endangering global health and the economy, the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. At present, various diagnostic kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 are available for use to initiate appropriate treatment faster and to limit further spread of the virus. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 or potential clinical benefits. In addition, institutions and companies worldwide are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines against COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine has yet been specifically approved for COVID-19. Given the urgency of the outbreak, we focus here on recent advances in the diagnostics, treatment, and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to guide strategies to address the current COVID-19 pandemic. © The author(s).

As our knowledge of the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the symptomatology and management of COVID-19 expands, orthopedic surgeons must remain up to date on the latest medical evidence and surgical perspectives. While COVID-19 primarily manifests with pulmonary symptoms, cardiovascular, neurologic, and other major organ systems may also be affected and present with hallmark imaging findings.

Such public safety infectious disease includes influences great pressure on the national economy. At present, some countries and regions in the world are still in epidemic situation, and there is an urgent need to judge the infection situation and travel risk in the region. In a relatively fine scale down to perceive the surrounding situation, and then rational zoning decisions to promote the resumption of production and work. In this study, indicators for the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic were constructed using multi-sourced data. A computational evaluation of 736 fine-grained grids was performed using the GeoDetector model and the decision tree model. The study found that the risk level in older neighborhoods was much higher than in newer neighborhoods; the population density was the most important determinant of infection; the number of urban people slumped to 37% of that in usual times according to Tencent data after the 'city closure'; The model this paper used portrays the major factor in defining low-risk areas and high-risk areas, and offers suggestions and assessment from a geographical perspective to fight COVID-19, thus presenting great practical value. © 2013 IEEE.

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: An open-label randomized clinical trial study was performed in Tabriz, NorthWest of Iran. They were randomized to either the treatment with the bromhexine group or the control group, in a 1:1 ratio with 39 patients in each arm. Standard therapy was used in both groups and those patients in the treatment group received oral bromhexine 8 mg three times a day additionally. The primary outcome was a decrease in the rate of ICU admissions, intubation/ mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Results: A total of 78 patients with similar demographic and disease characteristics were enrolled. There was a significant reduction in ICU admissions (2 out of 39 vs. 11 out of 39, P= 0.006), intubation (1 out of 39 vs. 9 out of 39, P= 0.007) and death (0 vs. 5, P= 0.027) in the bromhexine treated group compared to the standard group. No patients were withdrawn from the study because of adverse effects. Conclusion: The early administration of oral bromhexine reduces the ICU transfer, intubation, and the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. This affordable medication can easily be administered everywhere with a huge positive impact(s) on public health and the world economy. Altogether, the verification of our results on a larger scale and different medical centers is strongly recommended. © 2020 The Author(s).

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial task, as it reduces the risk of pandemic spread, and early treatment will save patients' life. Due to the time-consuming, complex nature, and high false-negative rate of the gold-standard RT-PCR test used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the need for an additional diagnosis method has increased. Studies have proved the significance of X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The dissemination of deep-learning techniques on X-ray images can automate the diagnosis process and serve as an assistive tool for radiologists. In this study, we used four deep-learning models-DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19-using the transfer-learning concept for the diagnosis of X-ray images as COVID-19 or normal. In the proposed study, VGG16 and VGG19 outperformed the other two deep-learning models. The study achieved an overall classification accuracy of 99.3%. © 2020 by the authors.

Different efforts are ongoing on the development of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 treatment. However, the leading strategy to curtail the spread of the dis-eases has been various control measures which aim at breaking the chain of COVID-19 spread. In this work, we investigate the impact of government control measures and immune system strength on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Discrete delays are used to describe the restriction in social contacts due to government orders and the delay in infection manifestation due to immune response. The qualitative analysis of COVID-19 pandemic steady-state predict a stable state if COVID-19 latent period is negative and unstable state when the latent period is positive. The inclusion of delay in social contacts stabilizes the unstable pandemic steady-state when the infection is symptomatic and unstable when the infection is asymptomatic. Optimal strategy to flatten COVID-19 pandemic curve using social distance is also recommended. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.. All rights reserved.

International economies are stalled and social isolation based on palpable fear of death remains the order of the day. The United States and other countries are moving toward resuming work activities and social interaction to boost economic recovery. While this makes financial sense, from a medical perspective our population has already suffered and will continue to suffer severe losses in the absence of a viable aggressive prophylaxis strategy for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we present a plan to address this problem. © 2020 Stricker and Fesler. Coronavirus; COVID-19; Prophylaxis; SARS  Covid-19: Perspectives and vulnerability [Covid-19: Perspectivas e vulnerabilidade] [CoViD-19: Perspectivas y vulnerabilidad] Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread worldwide as a pandemic. It is noteworthy that CoViD-19 surpassed the health care system in many countries, due to the speed of its spread and the lack of foresight at the health level, as well as the underestimation of its contagiousness. Furthermore, being a new and unknown nosological entity, there are still no treatments that have been proven to be scientifically effective, safe; as well as a vaccine that will not destroy the pandemic. Therefore, the only response so far has been to try to limit the spread of the disease through good hygiene practices and social distancing. All this has caused the closure of the main parts of the economy and sudden high unemployment, causing negative consequences and a recession never seen before. The most widely adopted strategies have involved the epidemiological approach of promoting good hygiene practices and social distancing, including shelter-in-place and quarantine orders. These strategies have had varying degrees of success depending on the country. The common phrase used to describe the objective of this epidemiological approach is to flatten the curve, an effect that is achieved by reducing the number of infections. This approach was also a way to buy time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways of treatment, prepare health systems, that is, develop validated therapies and vaccines. Another approach would be to re-establish the economy more quickly and thus help the entire population avoid the profound adverse effects of a severe recession or depression on society and health; As well as, it would increase community immunity, lowering the risk for everyone, including those most susceptible to serious adverse outcomes, and those who develop immunity could donate serum fortified with antibodies, which could provide effective treatment as they develop and try vaccines and effective treatments to fight the disease. The balance between the strategies of the epidemiological approach to attenuate the contagion curve and the attempt to reopen a population and its economy will be the key to a successful future. This article was written with the hope of helping professionals understand the problems caused by CoViD-19. © 2020 Silver Horse.

Initial evidence from regions in nine EU countries The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was brought to the global spotlight in early 2020 and has already had significant impacts on daily life, while the effects could last for a long period. However, these impacts appear to have been regionally differentiated, since similar to previous pandemics, geography plays an important role in viruses' diffusion. This paper enriches our knowledge about the initial territorial impact of the pandemic, from January to May 2020, studying the spread of COVID-19 across 119 regional economies in nine EU countries and explaining its underlying factors. Air quality, demographics, global interconnectedness, urbanization trends, historic trends in health expenditure as well as the policies implemented to mitigate the pandemic were found to have influenced the regionally uneven mortality rate of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

India has one of the highest burden of COVID-19 disease in the world. Presentation of the disease is highly variable. Tuberculosis, one of the top ten causes of mortality has a presentation conspicuously similar to the current SARSCoV-2 infection. Co-infections of Tuberculosis with past corona virus epidemics like SARS and MERS-CoV had posed a major threat in spread of the disease. We suggest proper tuberculosis screening, isolation of patient, remote tracking of suspected patients for symptoms during the current pandemic. © 2020 PAGEPress Publications. All rights reserved.

Currently, most of the countries all over the world are studying extensively to better understand the antimalarial chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for therapeutic purposes due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, CQ and HCQ can have serious side effects, from psychiatric effects to sudden death. Therefore, a faster and more effective detection method is needed to monitor drug concentrations. In this review, a large study was conducted on the detection techniques and quantitative determination methods of CQ and its related metabolites. In this review, chromatography, electrophoresis, electroanalytical, spectroscopic, and immunological methods for CQ and related metabolites are discussed extensively. It is hoped that a better understanding of the CQ used for therapeutic purposes in the COVID-19 outbreak will be provided. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The adoption of a preventive measure is required to control the spread. This research explores the impact of influencing factors like COVID-19 knowledge, behavioral control, moral and subject norms, preventive e-guidelines by the government, and environmental factors on the intention to prevent COVID-19 and risk aversion. A cross-sectional study was performed of 310 respondents about different COVID-19 related influencing factors in Pakistan. The partial least square-structural equation modeling was applied to estimate the path coefficient. Moral and subject norms (0.359) had a comparatively higher path coefficient. Other influencing factors/drivers were preventive e-guideline by the government (0.215) followed by COVID-19 knowledge (0.197), and behavioral control (0.121). The intention to prevent COVID-19 showed a positive and significant impact (0.705) on risk aversion. The indirect analysis also confirmed that the positive influence of moral and subject norms, COVID-19 knowledge, preventive e-guideline by the government, and behavioral control on risk aversion. However, the path coefficient of environmental factors was negative but insignificant, which implies than environmental factors do not influence the intention to prevent COVID-19. It is suggested to provide clear guidelines using print, social, electronic media. It is also suggested to provide e-guidelines in local languages. The COVID-19 knowledge about its transmission, symptoms, and precautions is also useful. It is suggested to include the causes, symptoms, and precaution of viral diseases in the educational syllabus. The government should ensure the availability of preventive medical items like surgical masks and sanitizers to meet the demand of the public. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The tendency to confront these pandemics is still questionable. In January 2020, the first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in India was identified in Kerala. Later, the Indian government announced lockdown as a remedial action against COVID-19. The present work aims to elucidate the community behavioural response towards COVID-19 lockdown in India and presents comprehensive observations. Protection motivational theory has been used to build a conceptual framework. It was observed that community behavioural response includes maladaptive, adaptive and prosocial behaviours. In addition, we conclude that the effective strategy against the prevention, spread and control of pandemics and strategic management is still lacking. Hence, we propose a framework based on the learnings from COVID-19 to tackle future pandemics. © The Author(s) 2020.

The latter includes the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in clinical practice and research. We report a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on the use of clinical EEG in practice and research in several countries, and the recommendations of an international panel of experts for the safe application of EEG during and after this pandemic. Methods: Fifteen clinicians from 8 different countries and 25 researchers from 13 different countries reported the impact of COVID-19 on their EEG activities, the procedures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and precautions planned or already implemented during the reopening of EEG activities. Results: Of the 15 clinical centers responding, 11 reported a total stoppage of all EEG activities, while 4 reduced the number of tests per day. In research settings, all 25 laboratories reported a complete stoppage of activity, with 7 laboratories reopening to some extent since initial closure. In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings. The continued use of EEG is important in those with psychiatric diseases, particularly in times of social alarm such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2020.

The disease prevention is best practiced by informing about the illness, the symptoms experienced by individual, the virus and its route of transmission. The best way to prevent COVID-19 disease is by hand washing or using an alcohol-based preparation for hand rubbing and avoiding touching the face, particularly the nose. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat that has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality world wide. It also impacted the economy and social integrity. There is growing concern about the general population's mental health challenges, patients infected with COVID-19, close contacts, the elderly, children and health professionals. The article aims at increasing consciousness and emphasizing on various mental health issues experienced by various individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research.

The sudden outbreak of any disease defies the health care systems and economy of nations. COVID-19 is one of the viral diseases which broke out in Wuhan city of China in 2019. COVID-19 outbreak intermittently prevailed all over the world. It exposes the fragility of the established health care systems across the world in spite of comprising modern science and technology. Unfortunately, there is no chemotherapeutic agent in the regimen of antiviral drugs or no vaccine available to curb this infectious disease. As a consequence, this deadly infection has prevailed all over the world. The antiviral drugs used for viral diseases excluding COVID-19 infection are Ramdesvir, Favipiravir, and Ribavarin, and antimalarial agents (Chloroquine & Hydroxychloroquine) are being administered to the patients for redemption of this infection. Fortunately, these existing drugs have been found clinically active and are being used. In this review, we present the current scenario and status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development for COVID-19, and its impact on the socio-economic structure. © TÜBİTAK. Antivirals; COVID-19; Financial crisis; Mortality rate; Transmission rate (Ro); Vaccines  The rise and impact of COVID-19 in India The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in the city of Wuhan, China, has quickly spread to various countries, with many cases having been reported worldwide. As of May 8th, 2020, in India, 56,342 positive cases have been reported. India, with a population of more than 1.34 billion—the second largest population in the world—will have difficulty in controlling the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among its population. Multiple strategies would be highly necessary to handle the current outbreak; these include computational modeling, statistical tools, and quantitative analyses to control the spread as well as the rapid development of a new treatment. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has raised awareness about the recent outbreak and has taken necessary actions to control the spread of COVID-19. The central and state governments are taking several measures and formulating several wartime protocols to achieve this goal. Moreover, the Indian government implemented a 55-days lockdown throughout the country that started on March 25th, 2020, to reduce the transmission of the virus. This outbreak is inextricably linked to the economy of the nation, as it has dramatically impeded industrial sectors because people worldwide are currently cautious about engaging in business in the affected regions. © 2020 Kumar, Kumar, Christopher and Doss.

This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH COVID-19; MERS; SARS; spike protein; vaccine candidate; vaccine development  The Effects of COVID-19 on Fruit and Vegetable Production COVID-19 has had unprecedented effects on the US economy, in large part because of its effects on workers. Within food and agriculture, these effects pose the greatest threat to the production of labor-intensive commodities—in particular, fruits and vegetables, the production of which tends to require large numbers of workers for harvesting and packing. We econometrically estimate the effects of COVID-19 on fruit and vegetable production as the US agricultural labor supply is adversely affected by this pandemic. The major crop losses include $16 million in lettuce, $5 million in apples, and $4 million in grapes. © 2020 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association COVID-19; farm labor; fruit and vegetable production  Evaluating the plausible application of advanced machine learnings in exploring determinant factors of present pandemic: A case for continent specific COVID-19 analysis Coronavirus disease, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COVID-19), has become a global health concern due to its unpredictable nature and lack of adequate medicines. Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research. Additionally, all the models and data used in this study are open source and freely available, thereby, reproducibility and scientific replication will be achievable easily. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This disease has impacted worldwide and covered the globe in its threat. Scientists and physicians have been investigating pathophysiological aspects of this pandemic to understand the virus structure for the treatment development. In this mini review, we briefly discuss the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, its origin, diagnosis, and treatment. This study will provide an understanding of the role of artificial intelligence in this emerging COVID-19 pandemic along with the impact in our society, economy, health, and industrial level. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Among these discourses, coverage on influencers was prominent, likely as many of the issues arising from COVID-19 contingencies – such as digitalization, public messaging, and misinformation – are cornerstones of this digital economy. In response, this cross-cultural study draws on a corpus of Australian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean online news articles published between January and May 2020, to understand how local news ecologies were parsing the impacts of COVID-19 on influencers. From the coding of 150 news articles guided by Grounded Theory, this article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on influencers, and influencers’ engagements with and reactions to the pandemic. Our study of individual governments’ past engagements with their influencer industries suggest that local backstories and contexts are crucial to decipher why news angles tend to pitch particular stories on influencers. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus; COVID-19; influencers; press coverage; social media; wanghong  Deep learning based detection and analysis of COVID-19 on chest X-ray images Covid-19 is a rapidly spreading viral disease that infects not only humans, but animals are also infected because of this disease. The daily life of human beings, their health, and the economy of a country are affected due to this deadly viral disease. Covid-19 is a common spreading disease, and till now, not a single country can prepare a vaccine for COVID-19. A clinical study of COVID-19 infected patients has shown that these types of patients are mostly infected from a lung infection after coming in contact with this disease. Chest x-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT are a more effective imaging technique for diagnosing lunge related problems. Still, a substantial chest x-ray is a lower cost process in comparison to chest CT. Deep learning is the most successful technique of machine learning, which provides useful analysis to study a large amount of chest x-ray images that can critically impact on screening of Covid-19. In this work, we have taken the PA view of chest x-ray scans for covid-19 affected patients as well as healthy patients. After cleaning up the images and applying data augmentation, we have used deep learning-based CNN models and compared their performance. We have compared Inception V3, Xception, and ResNeXt models and examined their accuracy. To analyze the model performance, 6432 chest x-ray scans samples have been collected from the Kaggle repository, out of which 5467 were used for training and 965 for validation. In result analysis, the Xception model gives the highest accuracy (i.e., 97.97%) for detecting Chest X-rays images as compared to other models. This work only focuses on possible methods of classifying covid-19 infected patients and does not claim any medical accuracy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertake a critical analysis of Egyptian government's economic and social interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the funding of these interventions and their short- and long-term implications. Findings: The analysis shows that the Egyptian government's response to the pandemic will shrink Egypt's fiscal space significantly as increased borrowing and debt service obligations are not offset by the levying of corona tax on salaries and wages. However, increased taxation will impact negatively on poverty. The authors show that social interventions such as cash transfers are not provided at a level which will make an impact on alleviating poverty. The authors highlight increased spending on health as well as the adoption of a gender perspective in the response to the pandemic as positive outcomes with potential for future societal impact. Originality/value: The authors highlight the Egyptian government's budgetary response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic and social implications of this response. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The article also explores how universities and colleges in Jordan cope with the pandemic and manage their functions and staff during the virus outbreak. In addition, the article investigates whether the administration teams of universities in Jordan are prepared to come up with administrative strategies for post-corona crisis. Approach/Methodology/Design: The methodology used in this study is based on quantitative methods. A 23-item questionnaire was administered to 52 respondents working in universities in Jordan as academicians, decision-makers, administrators, and researchers. The 52 respondents were randomly selected from eight universities public and private. Findings: The study reveals that there is a growing concern over the transition from lockdown to university normal life. Most of the respondents agree that COVID-19 has considerable effects on the economic activity of higher education institutions. Moreover, the majority believes that universities in Jordan are not well-prepared in terms of strategic management to cope with the COVID-19 consequences. Practical Implications: The study will contribute positively to the understanding of the effects of COVID-19 on universities in Jordan. It will reflect the perceptions of different stakeholders in Jordan and thus provide a framework for future management strategies and decision making. Nevertheless, further research studies must be conducted in order to better understand the economic impact on universities and also to closely examine the management plans for the re-function of universities after the lockdown. Originality/value: This study measures the perceptions of different actors involved in higher education in Jordan by using Likert five-point scale. It is the one of the first studies to address the effects of COVID-19 on universities in Jordan. The study draws the attention to the lack of infrastructure in universities in Jordan and also the absence of strategic magagement to cope with uncertainties. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

In India, it has become a public health disaster and its' intensity increasing continuously. For the disaster risk reduction, and capacity building against the COVID-19 pandemic understanding of the relationship between socio-environmental conditions with the pandemic is very necessary. The objective of the present work is to construct a socio-environmental vulnerability index of the potential risk of community spread of COVID-19 using socio-economic and environmental variables. Methodology: In this, cross-sectional study principal component analyses have been used to drive SoEVI. 4 uncorrelated sub-index has been extracted from 16 sub-indicators which reflects 59% of the variance. Aggregation of 4 Sub-Index has been done to obtain the final vulnerability Index. Results: Results show that there is spatial variability in vulnerability based on environmental and socio-economic conditions. Districts of north and central India found more vulnerable then south India. Statistical significance has been tested using regression analysis, positive relation has been found between vulnerability index and confirmed and active cases. Conclusion: The vulnerability index has highlighted environmentaly and socioeconomicallybackward districts. These areas will suffer more critical problems against COVID-19 pandemic for their socio-environmental problem. © 2020 INDIACLEN Community risk; Composite index; COVID-19; Pandemic; Vulnerability  Antibody tests for COVID-19 The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a globally growing pandemic called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has disrupted social, political, and medical environments around the world. Nations are assessing ways to reopen businesses while trying to balance health care risks and economic fallouts. Strategies involving antibody testing have been proposed before phased reopening of the economy. Therefore, assessing the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients remains paramount to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 detect the presence of IgA, IgM, or IgG antibodies produced by B cells. There are four major types of antibody tests: rapid diagnostic tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, neutralization assays, and chemiluminescent immunoassays. Currently, there is no standard antibody test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during or after exposure or infection. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 have a low specificity within the first week of exposure and increase in the second and third weeks. The current data on antibody tests have several limitations in quality and the presence of bias. Specifically, many antibody tests have a high false-negative rate and a high risk of bias for participant selection, application of index tests, reference standard used, and flow and timing for antibody tests that may incorrectly report the accuracy of COVID-19 antibody tests. In this review, we summarize the current methods, sensitivity/specificity, and gaps in knowledge concerning COVID-19 antibody testing. © Copyright © 2020 Baylor University Medical Center.

We performed partial correlation analysis and linear mixed effect modelling to evaluate the association of the spread rate and motility of COVID-19 with maximum, minimum, average temperatures and diurnal temperature variation (difference between daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperature) and other environmental and socio-economic parameters. After controlling the effect of the duration since the first positive case, partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was not related with the spatial variability of the spread rate of COVID-19 at the global scale. Mortality was negatively related with temperature in the countries with high-income economies. In contrast, diurnal temperature variation was significantly and positively correlated with mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Taking the country heterogeneity into account, mixed effect modelling revealed that inclusion of temperature as a fixed factor in the model significantly improved model skill predicting mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis suggests that warm climate may reduce the mortality rate in high-income economies, but in low- and middle-income countries, high diurnal temperature variation may increase the mortality risk. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Clinical evidences demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces detrimental levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and significant systemic organ damage. Currently, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19 or associated complications, and with the hope of a safe and effective vaccine in the distant future, the search for an answer is paramount. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a viable option due to their immunomodulatory effects and tissue repair and regeneration abilities. Studies have demonstrated that compassionate use of MSCs can reduce symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminate fluid buildup, and act as a regenerative technique for alveolar damage; all in a safe and effective way. With multiple autologous sources available for MSCs, each with their own respective limitations, allogenic umbilical cord (UC) and/or UC-derived Wharton’s jelly (WJ) seem to be best positioned source to harvest MSCs to treat COVID-19 and associated symptoms. As an allogenic source, UC is readily available, easily obtainable, and is rich in immunomodulatory and regenerative factors. In this manuscript, we reviewed the current evidences and explored the potential therapeutic use of allogenic UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although, preliminary preclinical and clinical studies indicate that their use is safe and potentially effective, more multi-center, randomized, controlled trials are needed to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2020, Japan Human Cell Society.

As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; DEMATEL; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Lockdown; Pandemic; Relaxed measures  Outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, a global pandemic. In an unprecedented collective effort, massive amounts of data are now being collected worldwide to estimate the immediate and long-term impact of this pandemic on the health system and the global economy. However, the precise timeline of the disease, its transmissibility, and the effect of mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we integrate a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model to quantify the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in China and the United States. For the outbreak in China, in n= 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.56 ± 0.72 days, a contact period of 1.47 ± 0.32 days, and an infectious period of 17.82 ± 2.95 days. We postulate that the latent and infectious periods are disease-specific, whereas the contact period is behavior-specific and can vary between different provinces, states, or countries. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n= 50 states, we adopted the disease-specific values from China and found a contact period of 3.38 ± 0.69 days. Our network model predicts that—without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today—the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 ± 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results demonstrate how mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. We anticipate that our model will become a valuable tool to estimate the potential of vaccination and quantify the effect of relaxing political measures including total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and is the causative agent of a very fatal disease that has had global implications, in healthcare, medical resources and the financial economies. The SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to have a zoonotic origin, based on the reports of the virus originating from the animal market in Wuhan, China. The disease is spread amongst humans via direct contact and respiratory droplets. The virus mainly infects the respiratory system and also involves other major organ systems. As this is a novel coronavirus, there has not been many studies regarding the virus’s infectivity and treatment. However, since its emergence, efforts have been made to differentiate it from other diseases having a similar presentation, for treatment and for production of a vaccine. In this manuscript, we aim to highlight the important traits of the novel coronavirus, the disease COVID-19 and its presentation. The particular focus is based on the effects of COVID-19 on human health and its available therapeutic measure. At the time of this pandemic, the global health systems were not adequately sufficed to appropriately deal with it. Most importantly, and unfortunately, the health care personnel and their health is being largely overlooked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The manuscript is, therefore, an effort to draw the world’s attention towards the role of health care workers, the problems they are facing as the frontline soldiers in this unforeseen battlefield and their sustenance during this COVID-19 pandemic situation. The doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff is dealing the COVID-19 suspects and patients on daily basis with merely available precautionary measures across the globe, consequently putting their lives and wellbeing on risks for the sake of humanity. And, with the support of scientific literature and other reliable resources, we aimed with this viewpoint manuscript to highlight the COVID-19 related challenges to global health system, in particular context to health care personnel. © 2020 The Author(s).

It is not always limited to just paid employment. Occupations of the global population have been adversely affected in one way or the other because of this COVID-19 pandemic. Four different key sects of occupations were majorly affected. These are the occupations of those who are or were COVID-positive, occupations of healthy individuals affected by COVID-19/lockdown, occupations of the population highly susceptible and vulnerable of contracting COVID-19 and occupations having a direct impact on global market, supply chain or economy. These occupations were locked up due to the pandemic lockdown. Occupational therapists can scientifically analyse occupations and help formulate exit strategies for the lockdown. They are experts who understand and study the different ways of measuring participation in occupation to develop innovative strategies and therapeutic interventions to facilitate individuals' engagement in occupations. They can unravel the pragmatic strategies for preventing transmission (physical distancing, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment usage and decontamination) despite engaging in occupations safely and effectively. Nourishing this niche and essential science is pertinent, not just in this pandemic context but also against a backdrop of health and social care research, policy, practice and education for the future. © 2020 Kamalakannan S and Chakraborty S.

Forced emergence to find an effective vaccine to immunize people has led scientists to design and examine vaccine candidates all over the world. Until a vaccine is developed, however, effective treatment is needed to combat this virus, which is resistant to all conventional antiviral drugs. Accordingly, more about the structure, entry mechanism, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 is required. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the gateway to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, so our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 can help us to complete its mechanism of interaction with ACE2 and virus endocytosis, which can be interrupted by neutralizing small molecules or proteins. ACE2 also plays a crucial role in lung injury. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC ACE2; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ARDS; COVID-19; miRNA; SARS-CoV-2  Short-term forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic using Google Trends data: Evidence from 158 countries The ability of Google Trends data to forecast the number of new daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 is examined using a dataset of 158 countries. The analysis includes the computations of lag correlations between confirmed cases and Google data, Granger causality tests, and an out-of-sample forecasting exercise with 18 competing models with a forecast horizon of 14 days ahead. This evidence shows that Google-augmented models outperform the competing models for most of the countries. This is significant because Google data can complement epidemiological models during difficult times like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, when official statistics maybe not fully reliable and/or published with a delay. Moreover, real-time tracking with online-data is one of the instruments that can be used to keep the situation under control when national lockdowns are lifted and economies gradually reopen. © 2020 Sinergia Press.

[version 1; peer review: 3 approved, 1 approved with reservations] While the world is facing the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers must plan for the direct response to the outbreak while minimising its collateral impact. Maintaining the supply chain of pharmaceutical products is not only paramount to cover the immediate medical response but will be fundamental to reducing disruption of the healthcare delivery system, which requires constant medicines, diagnostic tools and vaccines for smooth functioning. In this equation, the role of the Indian pharmaceutical industry will not only be critical to meet the domestic need of over 1.3 billion inhabitants but will equally be important for the rest of the world, including wealthy economies. Preventing a significant disruption of the Indian pharmaceutical supply chain during the outbreak and preparing it for large scale production for COVID-19 therapeutic or preventive medical products will not only help India but will assist the global response to this outbreak. © 2020 Guerin PJ et al.

Therefore, firms are now trying to identify the ways for enhancing survivability of Sustainable Supply Chains (SSCs). This study has made an effort to develop a framework for enhancing survivability of SSCs to survive in and post-COVID-19 pandemic. This study has utilised Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method for identifying the significant factors for enhancing survivability of SSCs to be focused in pandemic situation. The study revealed that ‘Supply Chain Network Viability (SCV)’ is the main criterion for managing buyer–supplier relationship and enhancing survivability of SSCs during and post-COVID-19 situation. This study is helpful for firms, suppliers, and other stakeholders to focus on the identified factors for healthier future. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. buyer–supplier relationship; COVID-19 pandemic; digital data-driven SCs; survivability; Sustainable supply chains (SSCs); viability  Strategic assessment of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: comparative lockdown scenario analysis, public perception, and management for sustainability Abstract: Community transmission of COVID-19 is happening in Bangladesh—the country which did not have a noteworthy health policy and legislative structures to combat a pandemic like COVID-19. Early strategic planning and groundwork for evolving and established challenges are crucial to assemble resources and react in an appropriate timely manner. This article, therefore, focuses on the public perception of comparative lockdown scenario analysis and how they may affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the strategic management regime of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh socio-economically as well as the implications of the withdrawal of partial lockdown plan. Scenario-based public perceptions were collected via a purposive sampling survey method through a questionnaire. Datasets were analysed through a set of statistical techniques including classical test theory, principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearson’s correlation matrix and linear regression analysis. There were good associations among the lockdown scenarios and response strategies to be formulated. Scenario 1 describes how the death and infection rate will increase if the Bangladesh Government withdraws the existing partial lockdown. Scenario 2 outlines that limited people’s movement will enable low-level community transmission of COVID-19 with the infection and death rate will increase slowly (r = 0.540, p < 0.01). Moreover, there will be less supply of necessities of daily use with a price hike (r = 0.680, p < 0.01). In scenario 3, full lockdown will reduce community transmission and death from COVID-19 (r = 0.545, p < 0.01). However, along with the other problems gender discrimination and gender-based violence will increase rapidly (r = 0.661, p < 0.01). Due to full lockdown, the formal and informal business, economy, and education sector will be hampered severely (R = 0.695). Subsequently, there was a strong association between the loss of livelihood and the unemployment rate which will increase due to business shutdown (p < 0.01). This will lead to the severe sufferings of poor and vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas (p < 0.01). All these will further aggravate the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in the country in the coming months to be followed which will undoubtedly affect the Bangladesh targets to achieve the SDGs of 2030 and other development plans that need to be adjusted. From our analysis, it was apparent that maintaining partial lockdown with business and economic activities with social distancing and public health guidelines is the best strategy to maintain. However, as the government withdrew the partial lockdown, inclusive and transparent risk communication towards the public should be followed. Recovery and strengthening of the health sector, economy, industry, agriculture, and food security should be focused on under the “new normal standard of life” following health guidelines and social distancing. Proper response plans and strategic management are necessary for the sustainability of the nation. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The impact of the pandemic on illicit drug market remains scant. We expose the potential consequences the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the ability of people who use drugs to source their illicit drugs via cryptomarkets. Methods: We analyzed 262 self-reported submissions of illicit drug transactions on the darkweb. The self-reports include the date of the transaction, the types of illicit drugs bought/sold, and whether the shipment of the illicit drugs succeeded, had issues (ex. unusually long delivery, an error in the type of drug shipped, quantity or concentration of the drug), or failed. Results: Between January 1st, 2020 and March 21, 2020, successful deliveries represented 60% to 100% of transactions. Starting on March 21 however, the share of shipments that had issues or failed increased rapidly and represented a majority of all shipments. At the peak of the market disruption, the successful deliveries represented only 21% of all transactions. Conclusion: Illicit drug transactions on the darkweb were disrupted at the same time as lockdowns were put in place in the United States and in the United Kingdom. While no causation link can be established, the correlation suggests that lockdowns could have disrupted drug cryptomarkets activities. We discuss the market disruption in light of the literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Considering this, a proper understanding of serologic-based diagnostic testing characteristics is critical. The aim of this study was to perform a structured systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic characteristics of serological-based COVID-19 testing. Electronic searches were performed using Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Full-text observational studies that reported IgG or IgM diagnostic yield and used nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) of respiratory tract specimens, as a the reference standard in English language were included. A bivariate model was used to compute pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio (LR), diagnostic odds ratio (OR), and summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Five studies (n=1,166 individual tests) met inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for IgG was 81% [(95% CI, 61-92);I2=95.28], 97% [(95% CI, 78-100);I2=97.80], and 93% (95% CI, 91-95), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for IgM antibodies was 80% [(95% CI, 57-92);I2=94.63], 96% [(95% CI, 81-99);I2=92.96] and 95% (95% CI, 92-96). This meta-analysis demonstrates suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of serologic-based diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 and suggests that antibody testing alone, in its current form, is unlikely to be an adequate solution to the difficulties posed by COVID-19 and in guiding future policy decisions regarding social distancing and reopening of the economy worldwide. © 2020 CLINICS.

In situations like this, it is important to provide consumers with credible and reliable information about the pandemic which is affecting their lives and livelihoods. Articles about coronavirus published in online versions of USA Today online, Wall Street Journal online and NYTimes.com between January and March 2020 were identified. Only articles where the search terms appeared in the headline were included as it was considered a more effective approach to understanding the health communication trends for this outbreak. These criteria resulted in 5,285 articles published on this topic during this time. All articles were imported into Dedoose mixed-methods software for thematic analysis. The frequency of each identified theme appearing in reviewed articles was counted, together with excerpts illustrating the specific theme. Overall, the five most common themes appearing in reviewed articles were “financial impact of COVID-19” (11.6%), “stories of affected individuals” (7.0%), “death and death rates” (6.8%), “precaution recommendations for public” (6.2%), and “quarantine” (5.9%). The newspapers did not just report the numbers (number of infections, ventilators, deaths, economic losses) but they also reported the context of the pandemic, such as, impact on economy, efforts to slow the spread of infection, switch to working from home, presence of health disparities, scientific search for reliable COVID-19 tests, and effect on supply chains. News media play a vital role in enhancing understanding of pandemic, but also in shaping public response to public health messages. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Due to strict lockdown, the manufacturing and logistics activities have been suspended, and it has affected the demand and supply of various products as a result of restrictions imposed on shopkeepers and retailers. Impacts of COVID-19 are observed ubiquitously in every type of units from different sectors. In this study, a simulation model of the public distribution system (PDS) network is developed with three different scenarios to demonstrate disruptions in the food supply chain. Difficulties have been increased in matching supply and demand in a vast network of PDS because of changing scenarios with the growth of infected cases and recovery. This paper also highlights the importance of a resilient supply chain during a pandemic. Our proposed simulation model can help in developing a resilient and responsive food supply chain to match the varying demand, and then further assist in providing decision-making support for rerouting the vehicles as per travel restrictions in areas. Paper has been summarised with significant highlights and including future research scope for developing a more robust food supply chain network. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This article used an event study method to calculate the abnormal returns (AR) in the 10 trading days following the outbreak, from which it was found that both the Chinese and Asian stock markets had significantly declined, with the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) remaining negative in all the examined event window periods. This article also analysed the different industry index responses to the epidemic, from which it was found that the pharmaceutical manufacturing, software and IT services both had positive CAR, while transportation, lodging and catering had negative CAR during the event window. These results reflected the investors’ expectations for the different industries and the economy as a whole under the outbreak of the contagious coronavirus. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. abnormal return; COVID-19; investor sentiments; stock market indices  Brazilian Child Protection Professionals’ Resilient Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic Background: The COVID-19 pandemic deeply affected child protection professionals. One potential area of concern is whether and how the pandemic has dampened these individuals’ ability to engage in the resilient practices that are so vital to their wellbeing. Objective: Within the unique and understudied context of a developing economy facing the strain of an international pandemic, this study sought to expand our theoretical understanding of the individual and socio-ecological predictors of whether child protective services professionals engage in resilient behaviors. Participants and setting: Three hundred and nine professionals working in child protection related fields (e.g., psychologists, social workers, professors, pediatricians, nurses, and other clinicians). Methods: Participants were surveyed as to their demographics, current work conditions, their engagement in resilient behaviors, and potential individual and socio-ecological predictors of those behaviors. Results: Both job support for and individuals’ beliefs of the importance of resilient behaviors predicted their engagement in such behaviors. Conclusions: Child protection professionals' resilience must be fostered by socio-ecological contexts, such as their workplace and employers, and additional supports are needed during the trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Child Maltreatment; Child Protection; COVID-19; Psychological Resilience  Effect of COVID-19 outbreak on urban health and environment The WHO announced coronavirus disease a Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and it spreads across the whole planet. Aftermath of outbreak of this disease at the global level is more frightening and panicking than anyone’s worst nightmare. With more than 23 mln positive coronavirus cases and more than 800,000 causalities all over the world, the potential of this virus cannot be undermined. This pandemic has victimized all human beings residing on 209 countries and territories of the world. It emerged as an unbeatable global challenge that the world has never witnessed before. Consequently, the affected countries have sealed their borders and made populations reside in their homes until the pandemic is over. Thus, the victims of coronavirus are not only the ones who are exposed to it but also the ones who are affected by the lockdown imposed by the governments. The paper aims to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on air pollution of various countries. Papers indicating the relationship between air pollution levels and lockdown measures are analyzed. The dramatic U-turn from environmental degradation is definitely a silver lining in these black clouds. This paper reviews the repercussions of the pandemic in some nations, while war-like preparations continue to fight it. COVID-19 has dramatically improved the quality of air. Also, it has greatly affected the economy of various countries due to lockdown. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V. Air pollution; COVID-19; Urban health  Enhanced Gaussian process regression-based forecasting model for COVID-19 outbreak and significance of IoT for its detection Virus based epidemic is one of the speedy and widely spread infectious disease which can affect the economy of the country as well as it is life-threatening too. So, there is a need to forecast the epidemic lifespan, which can help us in taking preventive measures and remedial action on time. These preventive measures and corrective action may consist of closing schools, closing malls, closing theaters, sealing of borders, suspension of public services, and suspension of traveling. Resuming such restrictions is depends upon the outbreak momentum and its decay rate. The accurate forecasting of the epidemic lifespan is one of the enormously essential and challenging tasks. It is a challenging task because the lack of knowledge about the novel virus-based diseases and its consequences with complicated societal-governmental factors can influence the widespread of this newly born disease. At this stage, any forecasting can play a vital role, and it will be reliable too. As we know, the novel virus-based diseases are in a growing phase, and we also do not have real-time data samples. Thus, the biggest challenge is to find out the machine learning-based best forecasting model, which could offer better forecasting with the limited training samples. In this paper, the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) regression model with enhanced predictions of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is proposed. The purpose of the proposed MTGP regression model is to predict the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide. It will help the countries in planning their preventive measures to reduce the overall impact of the speedy and widely spread infectious disease. The result of the proposed model has been compared with the other prediction model to find out its suitability and correctness. In subsequent analysis, the significance of IoT based devices in COVID-19 detection and prevention has been discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

The challenges are different in different systems and economies. Crises such as these often provide governments with opportunities to remake systems. We use the recent experience from India, which rapidly shifted between total countrywide prohibition of alcohol and unrestricted sales during this brief period, to argue against using the present crisis to bring about quick changes in alcohol policy in India. Instead, we advocate sustained, incremental pressure to develop and enforce alcohol control measures in public health delivery systems, in addition to demand reduction measures. © 2020 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs alcohol; COVID-19; harm reduction; India; policy  The non-existent regional response to COVID-19 in Latin America [La inexistente respuesta regional a la COVID-19 en América Latina] Latin America is facing the pandemic situation caused by COVID-19 devoid of regional spaces for consensus and cooperation. The end of an expansionary cycle of the economy, added to a very weak social structure, with unresolved pressing needs, does not represent the best scenario to confront the health alert situation. The objective of this work is to reflect on these aspects, warning of the absence of a solid regional architecture and its consequences. For this, the work reviews all the regional schemes of the continent and analyzes the way in which multilateral spaces have been arranged for joint decision-making. Thus, except for the Central American Integration System and the Pan American Health Organization, it is scarcely possible to find regional commitments beyond the exchange of information or concern about economic recovery. © 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

It analyses how the contradictions of Australian higher education, driven by expanding participation in the higher education system within the context of contained public funding, have been politically managed through regulatory regimes that link the public university with the neoliberal capitalist economy. Such modes of state intervention have been dependent on financialized instruments such as income contingent loans, the education–migration nexus, and precarious work. These regulatory instruments, embedded within a project of market citizenship, have both managed and expanded the marketization of higher education while also expanding participation. It is this regulatory model of market citizenship that is now facing a crisis of crisis management. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

There is hardly a country in the world that is not currently facing this problem. The number of cases is constantly growing, patients and carriers being the main mode of transmission. The economies of all countries are at stake. However, people need essential goods and food, regardless of the situation. In this respect, agriculture, food industry, food market, and catering have become priority industries. A continuous operation of food service enterprises (FSE) is crucial for the uninterrupted food supply in the period of preventive measures. The paper describes how pathogen makes its way into FSEs, spreads, and infects people. This information makes it possible to assess the probability of coronavirus infection and to reduce its spread, thus ensuring the safe operation of the enterprise. There are three transmission routes the coronavirus can take at a FSE: (1) aerial transmission by droplets and aerosols during the main and secondary technological production processes, (2) person-to-person transmission from clients to staff or from employee to employee via direct or indirect contact, (3) transmission via contaminated surfaces, e.g. packaging, furniture, equipment, etc. FSEs have to follow the recommendations published by the federal and/or local authorities, which may vary depending on the COVID-19 incidence rate in the area. These recommendations are based on the probability of the public health risk associated with person-to-person transmission, rather than on food safety. © 2020, Mayurnikova et al.

Vaccine safety and efficacy requires meticulous testing and oversight; this paper describes how despite grandiose public statements, the current vaccine development, testing, and production methods may prove to be ethically dubious, medically dangerous, and socially volatile. The basic moral concern is the potential danger to the health of human test subjects and, eventually, many vaccine recipients. This is further complicated by economic and political pressures to reduce government oversight on rushed vaccine testing and production, nationalistic distribution goals, and failure to plan for the widespread immunization needed to produce global herd immunity. As this paper asserts, the public must be better informed to assess promises about the novel vaccines being produced and to tolerate delays and uncertainty. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Methods: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non–intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. Results: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. Conclusions: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model–projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available. Despite evolving differences between government policy and Imperial model–projected suppression policy, it is hoped this article will provide some early insight into the trade-offs that are involved. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research coronavirus; cost-effectiveness; COVID-19; economic evaluation; mitigation; suppression; United Kingdom  Theorizing the virus: abjection and the COVID-19 pandemic Purpose: Using Kristeva's theory of abjection, this article analyzes the psychosocial reality of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, advancing the understanding of exclusion and stigmatization as forms of social abjection. Design/methodology/approach: The article applies abjection to understand how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is both a medical emergency but also a cultural challenge. The analysis is structured in three dimensions: (1) the transgressive potential of the virus, (2) forms of cultural coping with its threat and (3) the moral order of abjection. Findings: The virus is an existential challenge to cultural boundaries and subjectivity. Strategies to prevent its further spread (e.g. handwashing, “social distancing” and closing national borders) are thus culturally significant. The virus triggers the processes of abjection, (re-)establishing challenged boundaries and exclusionary social hierarchies. Collateral consequences of protective measures vary across regions and social groups, creating and exacerbating social inequalities. Research limitations/implications: Practices of abjecting the virus go far beyond handwashing, masking, etc. The virus, an invisible enemy to be expunged, is also a hybrid of threatening pathogen and human body; it is not the virus but people who experience exclusion, discrimination and disrespect. Thus, cultural sociology must address the moral economy of abjection. Social implications: As Kristeva insists, the abject threatens both the subject and the symbolic order. Overcoming social abjection means recognizing and strengthening individual and community agency and requires understanding vulnerability as an anthropological condition, enacting caring relationships and acting in solidarity. Originality/value: This article demonstrates that abjection is a suitable theoretical tool for analyzing the social dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

For some, the pandemic is a crisis that will reshuffle the decks, producing a fundamental reordering of global politics. For others, the basic principles of the international order are likely to remain much the same, driven largely by the emerging bipolar system between the US and China. We find both narratives dissatisfying, as the former overinterprets the causal role of the pandemic itself, while the latter underappreciates the critical ways in which global politics have been transformed beyond the state-centered system of the Cold War. We argue instead that the pandemic exposes underlying trends already at work and forces scholars to open the aperture on how we study globalization. Most centrally, we contend that globalization needs to be seen not just as a distributional game of winners and losers but rather a more profoundly transformational game that reshapes identities, redefines channels of power and authority, and generates new sites for contentious politics. We draw on emerging work to sketch out a theoretical frame for thinking about the politics of globalization, and assess some of the key policy arenas where COVID-19 is accelerating the transformative effects of globalization. In so doing, we suggest a roadmap to a post-pandemic research agenda for studying global markets that more fully captures these transformations and their implications for world politics.

It's impact on people, economy, and environment The paper reviews the (a) existing knowledge on corona virus disease (b) policy responses to it, and (c) its impact on the people, economic activities, and environment of India. The pandemic has increased a sense of fear and insecurity among people due to probable job and pay loss. As well, the nationwide lockdown imposed by the government has increased cases of domestic violence and child abuse. The industrial sectors—tourism, aviation, agriculture, construction, retail, hotels, textile, gems/jewellery, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), manufacturing, and start-ups are temporarily closed leading to a significant revenue loss. Consequently, existence of many sectors and employability of a sizable number of employees is at stake. Despite the economic slowdown, the lockdown has become a boon for the environment to revive due to less pollution and reduced discharge of effluents to water from factories. The policy formulators should consider this as wakeup call and thereby align the people, economy, and environment strategically. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Lessons for health service: The chernobyl accident and the COVID-19 pandemic [УроКИ для здрАВоохрАненИя: АВАрИя нА ЧАЭС И пАндеМИя COVID-19] Purpose: The article is devoted to the analysis of organizational measures to overcome the medical consequences of two large-scale events: the Chernobyl accident on 26.04.1986 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: A comparison of the causes, key factors, numbers affected and involved in these events persons, and the availability of the source of knowledge about the clinical picture, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases, developing as a result of radiation exposure and the virus SARS-Cov-2. The article considers the availability of special medical institutions, the infectability of medical workers, the presence of long-term consequences for the health of victims and for the economy. Conclusions: In the development of such catastrophic events, an important role should be played by 1) Timely and adequate information to the population. 2) It is necessary to have a sufficient number of beds that can be repurposed in accordance with the needs and provided with appropriate equipment to support the vital functions of the body. 3) Planned training of qualified medical personnel should be carried out. 4) It is necessary to have stocks of emergency drugs close to the institutions where it is possible to receive victims. © 2020 State Research Center, Burnasyan Federal Medical Biophysical Center of Federal Medical Biological Agency.

In this paper, economic systems dominated by a capital accumulating growth imperative are shown to have had their structural weaknesses exposed, revealing numerous problems including unstable supply chains, unjust social provisioning of essentials, profiteering, precarious employment, inequities and pollution. Such phenomena must be understood in the context of long standing critiques relating to the limits of economic systems, their consumerist values and divorce from biophysical reality. Critical reflection on the Coronavirus pandemic is combined with a review of how economists have defended economic growth as sustainable, Green and inclusive regardless of systemic limits and multiple crises–climate emergency, economic crash and pandemic. Instead of rebuilding the old flawed political economy again, what the world needs now is a more robust, just, ethical and equitable social-ecological economy. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions as well as the underlying economic policies behind the loans that IFIs are granting to States are studied, identifying clear signals that fiscal discipline and pro-market options will continue being the priorities as soon as the emergency has been overcome. The study explains how the adjustment and austerity policies implemented in the countries in the region have adversely and disproportionally affected women's rights, in particular reinforcing the invisibilization of gender inequalities in the domestic and care work and how this situation, in turn, has put women in a situation of greater vulnerability to the pandemic. It also criticizes the (self)called ""gender approach"" of IFIs for being merely instrumental to economic growth without consideration to the intrinsic value of gender equality and women's rights. The responsibility of IFIs for complicity with economic reforms with known adverse effects on gender equality is studied. Given the policy and legal implications of the findings presented in this research, the article concludes that States in the region should consider carefully the conditions of the loans being offered by IFIs, for which it is crucial to conduct ex ante evaluations of the impact of these financial contacts on the human rights of the population, and in particular on gender equality. © Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

The stock market information of the top 32 coronavirus affected economies (as of 31st March 2020) was sampled for ex-ante and ex-post COVID-19 outbreak analysis using the Detrended Moving Cross-Correlation Analysis (DMCA) and Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) techniques. The results confirm a fractal contagion effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock markets. Furthermore, this fractal contagion effect fizzles out over time (in the middle and long run) for both the stock markets return and volatility. Therefore, this article provides pieces of evidence for the COVID-19 fractal contagion effect on the stock markets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics have been partially described in some observational studies. Not enough systematic reviews on predictors of critical illness and mortality in COVID 19 have been published to date. In this review, we had illustrated the prognostic predictors of COVID-19 by gathering published information on the risk factors related to the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. © 2020 Aly et al.

It is a potentially fatal disease that is of public health and economy concern globally. In December 2019, COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China furthermore spread worldwide. Research is underway in many countries to develop effective vaccines and drugs for the COVID-19. In Ayurveda, Acharya Charaka explained the concept of an epidemic condition in Janapadodhwansa Adhayay and combating of these diseases is to be done by Panchakarma (five procedures of purification), Rasayana Chikitsa (immune-modulators therapy) and Sadvritta (good conduct). Rasayan dravyas (immunomodulator drugs) of Ayurveda can be used for health promotion, immune-modulation, prevention and reduce disease burden from COVID-19. Drugs such as Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers), Amalaki (Phyllanthus emblica L.), Mulethi (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.), Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus Willd.), Chireta (Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum L.) Punarnava (Boerhaavia diffusa L.) and Pippali (Piper longum L.) For symptom management of COVID-19 like illness Agastya Haritaki, Anutaila, AYUSH-64 can be used. Scientific research on these drugs may reveal the new approach for the prevention and management of COVID-19. The main aim of this article is to review research which has already conducted and currently being carried out on the herbal plant for their immunomodulation property which have a possible application in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. © Niraj & Varsha (2020).

All the governments’ primary focus is to save humanity from this pandemic problem, and they have lockdown almost the entire nation to stop the spread of infection. This lockdown resulted in a considerable impact on the global as well as a local economy that will take a long time to perform with business as usual scenario. However, improvement in the air quality of the cities across the globe has emerged as a key benefit of this lockdown. Therefore, this study aims to assess the overall impact of social and travel lockdown in five megacities of India; Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. The study evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in five criteria pollutants over two time periods, i.e., March–April 2019 and March–April 2020 and 10th–20th March 2020 (before lockdown) and 25th March to 6th April 2020 (during lockdown). The results highlighted a statistically significant decline in all the pollutants in all the megacities except for ozone. It was observed that the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO declined by ~41% (66–39 µg m–3), ~52% (153–73 µg m–3), ~51% (39–19 µg m–3) and ~28% (0.9–0.65 mg m–3) during the lockdown phase in comparison to the before lockdown in Delhi, respectively. Similar decline in pollutant concentration was observed in other megacities as well. Further, the study conducted an expert survey to identify the possible challenges India might face after lockdown is over. All the experts said that reviving the economy will be a big challenge for the government, and it may result in some tradeoff while managing the air quality in the near future due to scarcity of funds, etc. © The Author(s).

Converging evidence from the current pandemic, previous outbreaks and controlled experiments indicates that SARS-CoVs are present in wastewater for several days, leading to potential health risks via waterborne and aerosolized wastewater pathways. Conventional wastewater treatment provides only partial removal of SARS-CoVs, thus safe disposal or reuse will depend on the efficacy of final disinfection. This underscores the need for a risk assessment and management framework tailored to SARS-CoV-2 transmission via wastewater, including new tools for environmental surveillance, ensuring adequate disinfection as a component of overall COVID-19 pandemic containment. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

The questions deal with 1) how SARS-CoV-2 targets ACE2-expressing human cells via its spike protein, 2) the COVID-19 disease caused by it, 3) the COVID-19 pandemic and attempts to control it, 4) how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 and how the immune system is affected by exercise training, 5) advice for exercise during the pandemic for healthy adults, athletes and elderly, and possible control measures to help to return to normal sport and exercise at the end of the pandemic before herd immunity or mass vaccination has been achieved. © 2020, Dynamic Media Sales Verlag.

An online survey was conducted through snowball sampling technique and total 367 people participated in the survey. The results of the study show that COVID-19 cases spiked amid ease of lockdown in the country and the spread of novel coronavirus pandemic has significant socioeconomic impact on the lives of mountain communities in Gilgit-Baltistan. Financial uncertainty, decrease in income, fear of job loss, and food insecurity are some major challenges that mountain communities face due to outbreak of coronavirus in the region. The results further show that lack of community cooperation with government agencies, lack of awareness about the severity of coronavirus, and insufficient COVID-19 testing kits are the major factors that caused the spread of coronavirus cases. This study suggests that the short-, medium-, and long-term policies are required to mitigate the consequences of this pandemic and to revitalize the mountain economy of Gilgit-Baltistan, and in this regard, this study provides baseline information for policy-makers and practitioners to devise such demanding policies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Comparative strategic approaches to COVID-19 in Africa: Balancing public interest with civil liberties As COVID-19 spreads rapidly across Africa, causing havoc to economies and disruption to already fragile healthcare systems, it is becoming clear that despite standardised global health strategies, national and local government responses must be tailored to their individual settings. Some African countries have adopted stringent measures such as national lockdown, quarantine or isolation, in combination with good hand hygiene, mandatory wearing of masks and physical distancing, to prevent an impending healthcare crisis. The impact of stringent measures in low- to middle-income African countries has bought time for healthcare facilities to prepare for the onslaught of COVID-19 cases, but some measures have been challenging to implement. In some settings, public health measures have been associated with serious violations of individual rights owing to abuse of power and gaps in implementation of well-intentioned policy. Collateral damage with regard to non-COVID-19 diseases that were suboptimally managed in pre-pandemic times may mean that lives lost from other diseases could exceed those saved from COVID-19. While individuals complying with lockdown regulations have embraced an acceptance of the concept of the common good, at a broad community level many are finding the transition from individualism to collective thinking required during a pandemic difficult to navigate. In this article, we look at government responses to the pandemic in six African countries (Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana), and highlight ethical concerns arising in these contexts. © 2020 South African Medical Association.

Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S-spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor for internalization, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVID-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced angiotensin converting enzyme 2 downregulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heighten angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as elderly adults and those with cardiovascular risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis-like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multiorgan failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, in particular, in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as interleukin-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration, and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and thrombosis remain important. Specific evidence-based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated. To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Effectively stimulating consumption has become a momentous mission in responding to the impact of the epidemic. The popularity of mobile shopping makes shopping behavior no longer limited by time and space, so impulse purchase is more commonly seen nowadays; it can effectively promote residents’ consumption. However, consensus has not been reached regarding how impulse purchase emerges as a phenomenon, thus making it difficult to promote consumers’ purchase behavior. This article aims to explore the generation process of consumers’ impulsive purchase intention during the COVID-19 outbreak from the perspective of system users. For this purpose, the research proposes three mobile situation factors: personalized recommendation, visual appeal, and system usability. They have a positive impact on impulse purchase intention by influencing perceived arousal and perceived enjoyment. The experimental method is used for data collection and hypothesis testing. All the hypotheses are supported. And the theoretical value of the model of “mobile environment stimulation-consumer emotion-impulse purchase intention” is confirmed. Based on the conclusion, management suggestions are proposed for mobile shopping merchants from the perspective of improving consumers’ shopping experience and expanding marketing. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

Adoption of green fertilizer a potential resolution The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more than 4.3 million confirmed cases and more than 2,90,000 deaths worldwide. It has also given rise to fears of an imminent economic crisis and recession. Social distance, self-isolation, and travel restrictions have led to a reduction in the workforce across all economical sectors and have led to a loss of many jobs. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured goods has decreased. On the other hand, the need for medical supplies has increased significantly. The food sector is also facing increased demand as a result of panic buying and storing food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on the various aspects of the world economy. In Malaysia, the COVID-19 epidemic has checked the resilience of the agriculture sector. Especially the Malaysian paddy industry as country imports 30% of its overall consumption from different parts of the world. The real price of rice triplicating for the consumers, which was alarming for nations in this pandemic situation. The Government of Malaysia introduced the National Agrofood Policy 2011–2020 (NAP4) in 2010 as a guidance document for the implementation of agricultural sector development programs and projects in Malaysia. The NAP4 ‘s 10-year term is to be finished by the end of 2020. Several sectors demonstrate substantial success after approximately 8 years of introduction, while the other classes often lag behind the goal and progress quite slowly. Agricultural sector performance is affected by many problems and challenges. In acknowledgment of the poor success of this field, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Based Industry has launched new approaches, policies, and programs that can change the agricultural sector more rapidly. The new direction is aimed at ensuring national food security and boosting farm and revenues. The authorized government agency needs to revise the policy formulation where Malaysia needs to set stages to revolutionize and modernize the rice farming to address the problem faced by the paddy sector in this pandemic situation to adopt GF. In this study, the researcher focuses on the improvisation of the policy to increase the paddy production sustainably. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of social isolation on the physical and mental health of older adults and to learn how they are informing themselves about the pandemic. It is a qualitative study with a phenomenological basis, composed by telephone interviews with 35 older adults (70,5 ± 4,7 years) of both genders, members of a Brazilian University of Third Age, during the period of the pandemic. The testimonies revealed a considerable degree of concern about the possibility of being infected by the virus, increased anxiety due to tragic news, the growing number of deaths, the collapse of the Brazilian economy and the rising unemployment rate. The group reported sleep disorders, joint pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, and reduced functional capacity. Everyone felt sufficiently informed about Covid-19. The main means of gaining information about the pandemic was radio, followed by TV, dialogue with family and friends, and WhatsApp. Only 30% of the participants used WhatsApp, praised because of its multiple functions and the ability to re-read the news. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.   Effects of covid-19 pandemic on health and wellbeing of older people: A comprehensive review The pandemic is unavoidable; in addition to increased morbidity and mortality, they profoundly affect people and economies at every level. The negative effects of pandemics are more severe in marginalized populations such as older adults who have higher risks of acquiring infection, more disease-related complications, and increased risks of death. Furthermore, older people are affected by policy decisions and containment measures taken during pandemics. With rapid patient turnover and overwhelmed health care facilities, this older population may not receive proper medical care. In addition to poor clinical outcomes, such measures have profound negative effects on the mental health of older populations. © 2020 by The Korean Geriatrics Society.

The threat of contagious infectious diseases is constantly evolving as demographic explosion, travel globalization, and changes in human lifestyle increase the risk of spreading pathogens, leading to accelerated changes in disease landscape. Of particular interest is the aftermath of superimposing viral epidemics (especially SARS-CoV-2) over long-standing diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant disease for public health worldwide and especially in emerging economies. Methods and Results. The PubMed electronic database was systematically searched for relevant articles linking TB, influenza, and SARS-CoV viruses and subsequently assessed eligibility according to inclusion criteria. Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (focusing on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? Discussions. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from past outbreaks (other coronaviruses) and influenza pandemic/seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection. Conclusions. Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their lethal synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution. Despite the rapidly growing number of cases, the data needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with latent TB and TB sequelae still lies ahead. The trial is registered with NCT04327206, NCT01829490, and NCT04121494. © 2020 Radu Crisan-Dabija et al.

How and when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether SARS-CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means of a spatio-temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per capita and presence of mass transit systems in the province; in contrast, population density and percentage of older adults display negative associations with incidence of COVID-19. © 2020 The Ohio State University   Multilingual communication experiences of international students during the COVID-19 Pandemic While an increasing literature on multilingualism addresses the key role of language in access to social resources, including crisis communication, little attention has been paid to practices of English-mediated multilingualism. Based on semi-structured interviews with 10 international students from South Asia and Southeast Asia receiving their higher education in China, the study reveals what language-related challenges international students encounter, how they mobilize their multilingual resources to enhance their access to crisis communication and build a shared community, and how their multilingual competences are valorized and enacted in the shifting paradigm of the China-oriented new economy addressing mutual accountability in South-South cooperation. The study suggests that English-mediated multilingualism in China fails to bridge the needs of international students of diverse backgrounds. The study also calls attention to the shifting paradigm of multilingual studies and the necessity of addressing the real world problems of health communication in a diverse context. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

In this interim, due to the impacts of this pandemic, startups are more prone to fail or succeed faster than ever before; however, the challenges they face are not yet clearly scrutinized, as the pandemic was faster than scholars. This study therefore investigates the main challenges of Iranian startups by interviewing the co-founders of fifteen well-known startups. The findings are analyzed through two-step coding, and findings were discussed in a focus group session to which startup co-founders, policymakers, and scholars were invited. It was revealed that there are six principal types of challenges to be addressed, including financial, human resources management, support measures and mechanisms, marketing, crisis management, as well as some others. © 2020 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat. challenges; COVID-19; Iran; Pandemic; startups  “I’m not against online teaching, but what about us?”: ICT in Ghana post Covid-19 Globally, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is regarded as a dependable vehicle for facilitating educational reform and development, a platform for communication, and as a means to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal Four (SDG 4). Since the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and declaration of the SDG 4, many countries have opted to embrace the lifelong education for all by integrating ICT in teaching and learning at all school levels. The Ghanaian Government’s initiative to ensure “education anytime anywhere for everyone” by revolutionizing teaching and learning through ICT has faced a lot of challenges and criticisms. The main mission of the Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) in 2003 was to transform Ghana into an information and technology-driven high-income economy through education, but this goal is yet to be realized. In the wake of the COVID-19 which has forced many countries and educational sectors to adopt online learning, there is a need to discuss the effectiveness of online learning and barriers to online learning in the developing contexts, and how to successfully integrate ICT in schools for online learning, especially rural schools where students’ educational careers are in jeopardy because they benefit less from online learning. The paper identifies critical factors that affect online learning, recommends post COVID-19 strategies to promote e-learning for policymakers in education and the government, and concludes with a conceptual model for emergency transition to e-learning. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Monitoring of infection rates and seroprevalence can guide public health measures to combat the pandemic. This depends on reliable tests on active and former infections. Here, we set out to develop and validate a specific and sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Methods: In our ELISA, we used SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a stabilized version of the spike (S) ectodomain as antigens. We assessed sera from patients infected with seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and controls. We determined and monitored IgM-, IgA- and IgG-antibody responses towards these antigens. In addition, for a panel of 22 sera, virus neutralization and ELISA parameters were measured and correlated. Results: The RBD-based ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2-directed antibodies, did not cross-react with seasonal coronavirus antibodies and correlated with virus neutralization (R2 = 0.89). Seroconversion started at 5 days after symptom onset and led to robust antibody levels at 10 days after symptom onset. We demonstrate high specificity (99.3%; N = 1000) and sensitivity (92% for IgA, 96% for IgG and 98% for IgM; &gt; 10 days after PCR-proven infection; N = 53) in serum. Conclusions: With the described RBD-based ELISA protocol, we provide a reliable test for seroepidemiological surveys. Due to high specificity and strong correlation with virus neutralization, the RBD ELISA holds great potential to become a preferred tool to assess thresholds of protective immunity after infection and vaccination. © 2020, The Author(s).

Since its early appearance in China Wuhan city, many countries undertook several strict regulations including lockdowns and social distancing measures. Unfortunately, these procedures have badly impacted the world economy. Detecting and isolating positive/probable virus infected cases using a tree tracking mechanism constitutes a backbone for containing and resisting such fast spreading disease. For helping this hard effort, this research presents an innovative case study based on big data processing techniques to build a complete tracking system able to identify the central areas of infected/suspected people, and the new suspected cases using health records integration with mobile stations spatio-temporal data logs. The main idea is to identify the positive cases historical movements by tracking their phone location for the last 14 days (i.e., the virus incubation period). Then, by acquiring the citizen’s mobile phone locations for the same period, the system will be able to measure the Euclidean distances between positive case locations and other nearby people to identify the in-contact suspected-cases using parallel clustering and classification techniques. Moreover, the daily change of the clusters size and its centroids will be used to predict new regions of infection, as well as, new cases. Moreover, this approach will support infection avoidance by alerting people approaching areas of high probability of infection using their mobile GPS location. This case study has been developed as a simulation system consisting of three components; positive cases/citizens movement’s data generation subsystem, big data processing platform including CPU/GPU tasks, and data visualization/map geotagging subsystem. The processing of such a big data system requires intensive computing tasks. Therefore, GPU tasks carried out to achieve high performance and accelerate the data processing. According to the simulated system results, data partitioning and processing speed up measures have been examined. © 2020 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

However, recent published literature places too little emphasis on the economy and economic environments and instead focuses on explanations rooted within individuals and families. In this article, we review research on families’ financial stress and well-being published in JFEI between 2010 and 2019, which analyzed data collected during the Great Recession and were subsequently published in the shadow of the economic downturn. We discuss the economy and economic environments as gaps in the literature and encourage future research to focus on these explanations of stress and well-being, especially in response to the pandemic recession. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Probably the COVID-19 contagion is the most adverse global public health, economic, social, and technological stress since the Second World War. It affects almost all countries and challenges the globalisation particularly the global supply chain. The research community struggles with the multidimensional consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. The critical goal is to quickly implement an efficient vaccine, as the society faces a tradeoff between death exposure and the size of the economic downturn. With this paper, we search for factors affecting contagion, mortality, and the time span between the country virus inception and first death. Additionally, we analyse the development of social media and financial markets. We applied a panel data set on all of the countries across the globe from 31 December 2019 until 31 March 2020 to investigate the patterns of epidemic development. We examined 7,642 country-daily data. We constructed classification tree regression, panel, and cross-sectional regression models. Our results support the conclusion that: 1) the speed of severity and contagion is different between themselves and across continents, 2) financial markets and social media respond differently to factors affecting contagion and severity, and 3) the time span between the first contagion in the economy and first death case cannot be plausibly explained with time-invariant variables. This research supports the policymakers with robust data for the informative allocation of scarce resources. © 2013 IEEE.

This approach does not assume relevant political-economic aggregations ex ante (such as industries or ‘classes’); rather, it explores different possible ways of aggregating social groups and defining their interests depending on the situation under investigation. Moreover, interdependencies in the economy impose the need to keep conflicts within boundaries that are compatible with the viability of the system. Because sectors and groups can be aggregated in different ways, dynamics also depends on how actors represent the system and their position therein, and hence what they understand their interest to be. Different representations give rise to different definitions of competing interests and viability requirements, which in turn generate different endogenous dynamics of the political-economic system. The approach is illustrated through the examples of the Eurozone crisis and Covid-19 crisis. © 2020 Eurozone; Political economy of structural change; Special interest groups; Structural Political Economy; Systemic interest  Harnessing Kenya’s Blue Economy: prospects and challenges Kenya enjoys a marine coastline of about 640 km giving a total area of territorial waters of 9700 km2 while the EEZ is 142,400 km2. She further lays claim to an extended EEZ of approximately 103,320 km2 and has 13,600 km2 of inland waters. The government recognizes the potential of this maritime resource to boost the country’s economic outlook and has made Blue Economy (BE) part of the economic pillar in its development blueprint. For effective development of the BE, Kenya needs, among other things, to: build human resource capacity through investing in marine education and training; boost marine scientific research; support the traditional industries of fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, blue biotechnology, ports and shipping; develop BE database; resolve outstanding boundary disputes; and reduce illegal unreported and unregulated fishing. The study posits that Kenya already has sector-wise experiences and assets as demonstrated by the numerous government institutions participating in the BE and is only lacking policy integration, coordination and coherence. © 2020 Indian Ocean Research Group.

Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to forecast economic indicators of the Saudi economy in the context of low oil prices which have taken a toll on the Saudi oil-dependent economy between 2014 and 2017. Trades and investments have plummeted, leading to significant budget deficits. In response, the government unveiled a plan called Saudi Vision 2030 in 2016 which has triggered structural economic reforms leading to an unprecedented strategy of transition from an oil-driven economy to a modern market economy. Design/methodology/approach: This paper forecasts with spectral analysis economic indicators of the Saudi economy up to 2030 to provide a clearer picture of the future economy assuming that the effects of recent reforms have not yet been traced by most of the economic indicators. Findings: 2018–2030 forecasts are all bearish except West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price expected to average $64.40 during the period 2019–2030. Two additional exceptions are the Saudi population that should grow to 40 million in 2030 and the swelling gross domestic product (GDP) generated by the non-oil sector resulting from bold actions of the Saudi government who is willing to become less dependent on revenues generated by the oil sector. Research limitations/implications: Government policymakers, economists and investors would have with spectral forecasts better insight and understanding of the Saudi economy dynamics at the early stage of major economic reforms implemented in the country. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has brutally hurt the Saudi economy following a collapse in the global demand for oil and an oversupplied industry. The impact on the Saudi economy will depend on the optimal response brought by its government. Social implications: Saudi Vision 2030 plan has already triggered a deep transformation of the Saudi society that is reviewed in this paper. Originality/value: The forecast of Saudi economic indicators is a timely topic considering the challenges facing the economy and reforms being undertaken. Applying an original forecasting technique to economic indicators adds to the originality of the paper. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Proactive information-sharing enabled citizens to develop a shared understanding of the situation, comply with the newly adopted rules and safety measures, and build confidence in their government’s abilities to manage the crisis. The case suggests that smart governance in South Korea can help to enable a smart form of justice that involves equity and fairness in information sharing and resource allocation among its residents and visitors, mitigates discrimination and exclusion, and facilitates democracy through an informed and involved citizenry. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Lack of effective treatment, coupled with etiology of COVID-19, has resulted in more than 500,000 confirmed deaths at the time of writing, and the global economy is at an unseen unprecedented low level with unknown near-and long-term consequences. Ingavirin has been considered a non-toxic broad-spectrum antiviral with a complex mechanism of action. The molecule was originally designed for the prophylaxis and treatment of flu caused by both Influenza A and B viruses and for the treatment of viral causes of acute respiratory illness. The article hypothesized that the efficiency of given 1H-imidazol-4-yl heterocyclic scaffold-containing compound against SARS-CoV-2 might be connected with its ability to interfere with specific heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (A1, for example). These specific cellular RNA-binding proteins showed affinity to Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein, which shared high homology with the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the fact was expressed by a sequence identity of 90.52%. Impairing of the interactions between nuclear ribonucleoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might result in the inhibition of a viral replication cycle. Additional immunomodulating properties of ingavirin could be favorable for induction of adaptive immunity of host cells. © 2020, Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne. All rights reserved.

Weak medical infrastructure and over-reliance on medical aids may eventually predict worse outcomes in Africa. To reverse this trend, Africa must re-evaluate the only area with strategic advantage; phytotherapy. One of the many plants with previous antiviral potency is against RNA viruses is Aframomum melegueta. In this study, one hundred (100) A. melegueta secondary metabolites have been mined and computational evaluated for inhibition of host furin, and SARS-COV-2 targets including 3C-like proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro), 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase (nsp16) and surface glycoprotein/ACE2 receptor interface. Silica-gel column partitioning of A. melegueta fruit/seed resulted in 6 fractions tested against furin activity. Diarylheptanoid (Letestuianin A), phenylpropanoid (4-Cinnamoyl-3-hydroxy-spiro[furan-5,2′-(1′H)-indene]-1′,2,3′(2′H,5H)-trione), flavonoids (Quercetin, Apigenin and Tectochrysin) have been identified as high-binding compounds to SARS-COV-2 targets in a polypharmacology manner. Di-ethyl-ether (IC50 = 0.03 mg/L), acetone (IC50 = 1.564 mg/L), ethyl-acetate (IC50 = 0.382 mg/L) and methanol (IC50 = 0.438 mg/L) fractions demonstrated the best inhibition in kinetic assay while DEF, ASF and MEF completely inhibited furin-recognition sequence containing Ebola virus-pre-glycoprotein. In conclusion, A. melegueta and its secondary metabolites have potential for addressing the therapeutic needs of African population during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Aframomum melegueta; COVID-19; Diarylheptanoid; flavonoids; phenylpropanoid; SARS-COV-2  Epigallocatechin gallate and theaflavin gallate interaction in SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein central channel with reference to the hydroxychloroquine interaction: Bioinformatics and molecular docking study SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 pandemic global outbreak created the most unstable situation of human health–economy. In the past two decades different parts of the word experienced smaller or bigger outbreak related to human coronaviruses. The spike glycoproteins of the COVID-19 (similar to SARS-CoV) attach to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) and transit over a stabilized open state for the viral internalization to the host cells and propagate with great efficacy. Higher rate of mutability makes this virus unpredictable/less sensitive to the protein/nucleic acid based drugs. In this emergent situation, drug-induced destabilization of spike binding to RBD could be a good strategy. In the current study we demonstrated by bioinformatics (CASTp: computed atlas of surface topography of protein, PyMol: molecular visualization) and molecular docking (PatchDock and Autodock) experiments that tea flavonoids catechin products mainly epigallocatechin gallate or other like theaflavin gallate demonstrated higher atomic contact energy (ACE) value, binding energy, Ki value, ligand efficiency, surface area and more amino acid interactions than hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during binding in the central channel of the spike protein. Moreover, out of three distinct binding sites (I, II and III) of spike core when HCQ binds only with site III (farthest from the nCoV-RBD of ACE2 contact), epigallocatechin gallate and theaflavin gallate bind all three sites. As sites I and II are in closer contact with open state location and viral–host contact area, these drugs might have significant effects. Taking into account the toxicity/side effects by chloroquine/HCQ, present drugs may be important. Our laboratory is working on tea flavonoids and other phytochemicals in the protection from toxicity, DNA/mitochondrial damage, inflammation and so on. The present data might be helpful for further analysis of flavonoids in this emergent pandemic situation. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC ACE2; hydroxychloroquine; pandemic global outbreak; PatchDock; SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19; spike glycoprotein; tea flavonoids  Identification of potential anti-TMPRSS2 natural products through homology modelling, virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation studies Recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a pandemic of COVID-19. The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual screening of Selleckchem database was performed through ‘Virtual Work Flow’ (VSW) to find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential for application in COVID-19.

Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2′-O position of the viral nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free energy of–12.83 ± 0.52 kcal/mol. The second best inhibitor, Galuteolin is a natural compound that inhibits tyrosinase enzyme with MM-PBSA binding free energy value of −11.21 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. Detailed ligand and protein interactions were analyzed and common residues across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV were identified. We propose Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and Galuteolin as the potential inhibitors of NSP16. The results in this study can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 and can also form the basis of rational drug design against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. coronavirus; COVID-19; docking; drug repurposing; MD simulation; virtual screening  The Low-Carbon Imperative: Destination Management under Urgent Climate Change To stay within the safe boundaries of global warming, the world now has 30 years to decarbonize its economy. This represents a very significant challenge for tourism as a growth system. Much attention has been paid to different tourism subsectors such as aviation, accommodation, and activities to reduce emissions, mostly on the basis of (future) technology. However, the Paris Agreement demands immediate action and significant year-on-year progress on a zero-carbon trajectory. This article discusses destination management under the new low-carbon imperative. It analyses challenges, including economic viability and resilience, that have also gained importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and explores opportunities for better profitability on the basis of a leakage/spending value dichotomy proposition. The final section highlights the foremost role that destination managers must play in building prosperous and resilient low-carbon tourism destination systems and discusses the key insights for destination managers. © The Author(s) 2020. carbon management; climate change; COVID-19; destination management; resilience; value generation  Entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance in a sanctioned economy – does the CEO play a role? Purpose: Entrepreneurship, in many low-resilient economies, plays a critical role in overcoming external shocks. Thus, it is crucial in such situation that entrepreneurial firms can survive and even grow so that the whole economy can benefit from a higher level of resilience. The purpose of this study is to understand how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) brings about firms' performance through the moderating role of CEOs' self-transcendence values in the context of a low-resilient sanctioned economy. Design/methodology/approach: This is a quantitative research that employs hierarchical regression analysis of a sample of 114 Iranian entrepreneurial firms composed of 62 knowledge-based and 52 creative firms. Findings: The analysis revealed that in the low-resilient sanctioned economy, Iran, EO-performance link is moderated by the level of CEOs' self-transcendence value, that is, higher level of CEO self-transcendence leads to stronger impact of EO on performance. This moderation is not different in creative sector vs. knowledge-based sector of the economy. Originality/value: This paper addresses a major gap in the traditional EO-performance relationship which is related to the role of CEO values. Also, the context of Iran's low level of economic resilience adds more novelty to this study, emphasizing on the role of CEO personal values of self-transcendence in times of crisis. The results could also be generalized in many economies now facing the COVID-19 pandemic crisis during which CEOs' self-transcendence values are vitally important in overcoming the difficulties of doing business in such situation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Green Dead Ends and Ways Out of the COVID-19 Crisis The coronavirus crisis has opened up a window of opportunity for transformation. This should be used without getting off the regulatory track. Green recovery programs must not be reduced to a mere competition for green subsidies. Abandoning barriers to green investments and imposing a carbon price are equally important. Where economically sensible, green subsidies should contribute both to stabilizing the economy and mitigating climate change. Moreover, smart green recovery programs may contribute to raising revenues for the additionally necessary public expenditures. © 2020, The Author(s).

The viruses have adapted to infect a large number of animal species, ranging from bats to camels. At present, seven CoVs infect humans, of which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe. Healthcare systems around the globe have been stretched beyond their limits posing new challenges to emergency healthcare services and critical care. The outbreak continues to jeopardize human health, social life and economy. All known human CoVs have zoonotic origins. Recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pet, zoo and certain farm animals has highlighted its potential for reverse zoonosis. This scenario is particularly alarming, since these animals could be potential reservoirs for secondary zoonotic infections. In this article, we highlight interspecies SARS-CoV-2 infections and focus on the reverse zoonotic potential of this virus. We also emphasize the importance of potential secondary zoonotic events and the One-Health and One-World approach to tackle such future pandemics. © 2020 The Author(s).

A Dsge Modeling In Small Open Economy This article aims to investigate the relationship between inbound tourism and housing market along with the recent boom in Icelandic real estate sector, in which both house and rental prices have been rising dramatically. To this end, we construct a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model enclosing a tourism sector and a housing market with owner-occupied and rental sections. The simulation results unveil a transmission channel that indicates the higher inbound tourism demand raises both house prices and rental prices. Variance decomposition and historical decomposition show that both inbound tourism demand shock and manufacturing technology shock are the key driving forces of the fluctuations of Icelandic house prices, consumption, and investment, whereas housing preference shock plays the most important role in determining the volatility of rental prices. The policy implications indicate that any shocks to tourism could easily spillover to housing market dynamics and aggregate fluctuations. © The Author(s) 2020.

Simultaneous with the rise of trade protectionism in the twenty-first century has been a resurgence in nationalist politics, most notably in the USA, the UK, and parts of the EU. These developments in international and US trade policy, including Washington’s launch of a full-fledged trade war against China in March 2018, have converged disastrously with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in November 2019 and the onset of a worldwide pandemic. Given the status of the USA as the world’s hegemon since 1945, what is new here is the effort of the Trump administration to abdicate US leadership, jettison longstanding alliances, and turn back the clock on the country’s close integration with the world economy. Already, greatly reduced flows of goods, services, and people have translated into radically reduced global growth, widespread business disruptions, and high unemployment. Remarkably, the White House has refused to recognize the severity of the pandemic and has undermined the precautions of the US science community. We argue that these multiple shocks constitute a major critical juncture on par with what the world community faced in 1945. However, in the twenty-first century we have seen that high levels of economic uncertainty and political instability have superseded the long-held notion that international interdependence would pull the world community through tough times such as these. Could the triple whammy of a destructive trade war, deadly pandemic, and secular decline of US leadership trigger a new generation of policy innovation and institution building on par with the post-1945 era? In terms of the global trade regime, it would be difficult to imagine a buoyant recovery of the world economy in the absence of a serious reckoning with the pattern of norm erosion that we identify here. © 2020, Fudan University.

The authors analyse the economic, social and political factors that have shaped the government's fiscal policy response to this economic shock. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyse the federal and provincial budget documents for the fiscal year 2020–21 to study the fiscal response of the government. The authors review recent research articles and news pieces to examine the determinants of these budgetary measures. Findings: The government adopted expansionary fiscal policy measures such as reduced taxation and increased government expenditure to counter the recessionary pressures of the pandemic. These measures, however, were largely constrained by macroeconomic issues of high fiscal debt, slow economic growth and low fiscal space and political influences from the military and religious groups. Research limitations/implications: The coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing issue which may pose more threats and elicit more policy responses as it evolves. This research may be extended as the pandemic progresses, to include further policy responses. Originality/value: This research provides insight into the unique problems faced by the Pakistani government during the pandemic, and how it steers the economy despite these limitations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Expectations for a vaccine are high while the case numbers continue to rise. As of mid-August 2020, more than 20 million people have been infected and more than 760 000 lives have been lost worldwide. The threat of this virus to health, the economy and to society is so great that the wish for a fast track vaccine is understandable, but how realistic is it? This survey article tries to give an overview of vaccine candidates in development, including preclinical and clinical testing, and it mentions some of the societal problems of vaccine acceptance. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd   COVID-19 lockdown and penalty of joblessness on income and remittances: A study of inter-state migrant labourers from Assam, India Present study made an attempt to examine the penalty of joblessness following coronavirus induced lockdown on income and remittances of inter-state migrant labourers from Assam. The primary data for the study were collected through telephonic-based survey of 451 labourers during May–June 2020. The results of this study showed that, on an average, labourers in the study area remained jobless for nearly 2 months and incurred income loss of INR 28,955 thereby failed to send remittances towards their families by an amount of INR 12,215 during the reference period. As per the analysis of covariance the income loss and remittances unsent amount was higher amongst the elderly labourers engaged in professions which remained non-operational during lockdown period. Further, the additional days of joblessness increased their hardship in terms of income and remittances. With coronavirus being more than a health crisis, in short term it is necessary to minimise the loss of life, forwarding social and financial security for the families of migrant labourers and vulnerable sections for extended period of crisis, strategies for supporting agriculture and allied activities, promotion of small and medium-size enterprises, imparting skill training for the unemployed and reverse migrant labourers, financial assistance for self-employment may be helpful. Suitable coordination of monetary and fiscal policy would be helpful for reducing the unemployment heading from the recessionary trend of the economy in the long run. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Operating room efficiency and timing during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in a referral orthopaedic hospital in Northern Italy Purpose: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affected health care systems at different levels with important consequences on health, economy, and social structures. This paper aims to analyse the impact on surgical block utilisation and efficiency in an orthopaedics reference centre in Northern Italy. Methods: The timeframe chosen for the current analysis was April 2020, to be compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Number and type of procedures, first case delay, occupancy rate, and turnover time were used as indicators to benchmark the activities. Results: The overall number of surgical procedures decreased by 57%, from 537 in 2019 to 230 in the same timeframe in 2020. Orthopaedic procedures predominated in 2019, with 434 cases (80.8%), while in 2020, trauma was the leading activity, with 200 cases (86.9%). Orthopaedic surgery had a relative decrement of 93% while trauma has relatively increased by 94%. Mean first case delay in orthopaedic room (OR) was two hours and 36 minutes (SD 01:40:21) in 2020 compared with only 19 minutes (SD 00:02:15) in 2019. OR occupancy rate was 59% in 2020 compared with 89% in 2019. Turnover time raised from 21 minutes in 2019 to 53 min in 2020. Conclusions: These data clearly show the deep impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OR facilities. Efficiency indicators fell dramatically in April 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019. This scenario will deeply affect both the waiting lists and the economic burden of the hospital. Regaining efficiency and maintaining the quality and safety of the process while restoring elective orthopaedic surgery are among the main challenges that surgeons will face in the next time. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.

There are both biological (sex) and socio-cultural (gender) factors, compounded by socio-economic factors and ethnicity, that impact on the aftermath of what has occurred over the short time that this novel coronavirus has been circulating the world. The potential life-long morbidity as a result of the infection and as a consequence of highly invasive critical care treatment needs to be factored into the rehabilitation of survivors. There are also many men whose lives will have been severely affected both physically and emotionally by the pandemic without ever contracting the disease, with the widespread disruption to normal existence and its impact on their social world and the economy. The implications of the closure of many healthcare services over the initial lockdown will also have both a shorter- and longer-term impact on other diseases due to missed early diagnosis and disrupted treatment regimes. Getting effective public health messages out to the population is critical and this current pandemic is demonstrating that there needs to be a more focused view on men’s health behavior. Without effective public support for preventative action, the more likely the disease will continue its path unabated. This review explores the wider ramifications of the disease both for those men who have survived the disease and those that have been affected by the wider social effects of the pandemic. The pandemic should be a wake-up call for all involved in the planning and delivery of health and social care for the greater attention to the central role of sex and gender. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This paper aims to investigate the potential of innovative regional development of the structurally disadvantaged industrial region focused on the steel and mining industry by means of the local currency. Being the important players of local economies and regional development, SMEs have always been in the center of interest for practitioners of the local and community currencies. Therefore, our research team analyzed and explored major benefits and barriers that SMEs perceive to adopt and use local currency. In parallel with the specified aims, the researchers employed the structured questionnaire survey with open and dichotomous questions focused on SMEs with no practical experience with the acceptance and use od the local or community currencies in Cieszyn Silesia region. The results of our research show that SMEs are prone to be active members of local currency communities, and they positively perceive the support that major regional producers, service providers, and practitioners can provide for them through this instrument. Moreover, some SMEs also perceive local currencies as a marketing and promotion tool that increases product-service quality and mutual transactions of firms. According to the respondents, high participation fees and exchange rates, lack of usage by customers and coverage by national currencies, counterfeiting, and fraud, liquidity risk, taxability, accountability, legislative and technical issues, credibility and trustworthiness of practitioners have been main impediments in the adoption and usage of these currencies by SMEs. This research provides innovative solutions and suggestions for policymakers in case of the regional development of the structurally disadvantaged industrial regions to overcome the barriers of local currencies. Since local currencies can be created in digital formats, the increasing importance of local digital currencies in the Covid-19 pandemic has also been highlighted. © 2020 by the authors.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) is responsible for causing this pandemic across different continents. It is not only impacting the world economy but also quarantined millions of people in their homes or hospitals. Purpose: At present, there is no Food and Drug Administration-approved drug or vaccine available to treat this disease. Still, people are trying various pre-existing medicines that are known to have anti-viral or anti-parasitic effects. In view of this, the present study aimed to study the binding potential of various phytochemicals present in multiple natural plant extract as a secondary metabolite to non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) protein, a drug target known to play a crucial role in virulence of coronavirus. Method: Nsp15 protein was selected because it shows 89% similarity to the other SARS-CoV, which caused the earlier outbreak. The assumption is that inhibition of Nsp15 slowdowns the viral replication. Phytochemicals are selected as these are present in various plant parts (seed, flower, roots, etc.), which are used in different food cuisines in different geographical regions across the globe. The molecular docking approach was performed using two different software, i.e., Autodock, and Swissdock, to study the interaction of various phytochemicals with Nsp15 protein. Hydroxychloroquine is used as a positive control as it is used by medical professionals showing some positive effects in dealing with coronavirus. Results: The present study demonstrated the binding potential of approximately 50 phytochemicals with Nsp15 and capable of inhibiting the viral replication, although in vitro and in vivo tests are required to confirm these findings. Conclusions: In conclusion, the present study successfully demonstrated the binding of phytochemicals such as sarsasapogenin, ursonic acid, curcumin, ajmalicine, novobiocin, silymarin and aranotin, piperine, gingerol, rosmarinic acid, and alpha terpinyl acetate to Nsp15 viral protein and they might play a key role in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Molecular docking; Non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15); Phytochemicals; SARS-CoV-2; Sarsasapogenin  Capitalism in Australia: New histories for a reimagined future Capitalism is back. Three decades ago, when all alternatives to liberal democracy and free markets appeared discredited, talk of capitalism seemed passé. Now, after a decade of political and economic turmoil, capitalism and its temporal critique of progress and decline again seems an indispensable category to understanding a world in flux. Among the social sciences, historians have led both the embrace and critique of this ‘re-emergent’ concept. This roundtable discussion between leading and emerging Australian scholars working across histories of economy, work, policy, geography and political economy, extends this agenda. Representing the outcome of a workshop convened at La Trobe University in November 2018 and responding to questions posed by conveners Huf and Rees, five participants debate the nature, utility and future of the new constellation of ‘economic’ historical scholarship. While conducted well before the outbreak of COVID-19, the ensuring discussion nevertheless speaks saliently to the crises of our times. © The Author(s) 2020. activism; Australia; capitalism; economics; history; political economy  Seeing like a city: how tech became urban The emergence of urban tech economies calls attention to the multidimensional spatiality of ecosystems made up of people and organizations that produce new digital technology. Since the economic crisis of 2008, city governments have aggressively pursued economic growth by nurturing these ecosystems. Elected officials create public-private-nonprofit partnerships to build an “innovation complex” of discursive, organizational, and geographical spaces; they aim not only to jump-start economic growth but to remake the city for a new modernity. But it is difficult to insert tech production space into the complicated urban matrix. Embedded industries and social communities want protection from expanding tech companies and the real estate developers who build for them. City council members, state legislators, and community organizations oppose the city government’s attempts to satisfy Big Tech companies. While the city’s density magnifies conflicts of interest over land-use and labor issues, the covid-19 pandemic raises serious questions about the city’s ability to both oppose Big Tech and keep creating tech jobs. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

There is widespread recognition that ecosystem disruption, including land-use change and illegal wildlife trade, is linked to the increasing emergence of zoonotic diseases. Here, we emphasize that protected areas play a fundamental role in buffering against novel disease outbreaks by maintaining ecosystem integrity. However, protected areas worldwide are facing increasing human pressures, which are being amplified by the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. Increased resources are thus urgently needed to mainstream a One Health approach to protected area management, focusing specifically on i) monitoring illegal wildlife trade, ii) biodiversity trends and iii) surveillance of zoonotic pathogens. Improving integration of public healthinto global biodiversity conservation policies should be a top priority to reduce the risk of future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.   The theory and empirics of the structural reshaping of globalization Petricevich and Teece’s (2019) article on the reshaping of globalization raises profound issues on the theory and empirics of international business. The fracture in the world economy between the USA and China is the result of Government policy, but its relationship to rising VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) elements in globalization is more complex than simple policy changes. This paper suggests that a reappraisal of theory is required, not least because of the eruption of Covid-19, but that internalization theory is the best source of theoretical restructuring in the face of the new empirical realities facing the global economy. © 2020, Academy of International Business.

I show that the consequences of FinTech are full of controversies, which are part of broader, long-standing debates on the role of finance in economy and society, and need to be approached from geographical perspectives. The intense fusion of fin and tech, arguably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, complicates and elevates these controversies to a new level. © The Author(s) 2020. financial geography; financial governance; financial inclusion; financial regulation; financial stability; financial technology; FinTech  Viral sovereignty or sequence etiquette? Asian science, open data, and knowledge control in global virus surveillance On several occasions, the People’s Republic of China refused to share influenza viruses isolated on their territory with the World Health Organization pandemic flu surveillance system. Scholars in STS and allied disciplines have described these disputes as examples of growing conflict between global health norms of free exchange and Asian state claims of viral sovereignty. However, the discussion has largely over-looked the fact that laboratories in China freely shared genetic sequence data from isolated viruses, even when they refused to ship physical samples, a fact that complicates the opposition of open data and viral sovereignty with the different material forms of the physical sample and the nucleotide sequence. This article provides a comprehensive comparison of the heterogeneous circulations of influenza virus samples and virus gene sequences in global health influenza surveillance and argues this difference is rooted in the different knowledge-control regimes designed for exchanging samples and sequences. Engaging with debates on the position of Asian science within global scientific circulations, the article suggests that Asian scientists confront a multiplicity of global scientific infrastructures and do not necessarily rely on the authority of nation-state sovereignty to reshape global exchanges. © 2020 Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

One way for AMNEs to address these challenges would be by adopting agile sustainability governance mechanisms. Drawing on the theories of experimentalist governance and deliberation, we propose a processual framework suited to develop agile sustainability governance mechanisms. We explore the challenges to supplier participation and the factors that enable an authentic dialogue in the process. We contribute to the scholarship on transnational governance and strategic agility, and offer practical implications which are also relevant for disruptions like COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Addressing this challenge, particularly as it pertains to Eurasia, our multinational group of scholars draws on past and ongoing research to suggest a roadmap for a new pandemic politics research subfield. Key research questions include not only how states are responding to the new coronavirus, but also reciprocal interactions between the pandemic and society, political economy, regime type, center-periphery relations, and international security. The Foucauldian concept of “biopolitics” holds out particular promise as a theoretical framework. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.   Technology and the sustainable tourist in the new age of disruption We are in the midst of a transition into a new age of travel and tourism based on the convergence of several key disruptive influences in the form of new technologies, periodic chaos in markets and economies, health and safety concerns, and environmental crises. How we navigate these disruptive influences is important for the enjoyment of tourists, the success of tourism service providers and other local people, and the integrity of the natural world. The purpose of this research note is to discuss a surrogate ecotour experience that allows tourists to remain home while employing local guides to facilitate personalised, interactive, real-time tours (PIRTs). It is argued that there is a market for this type of experience for persons with disabilities and the elderly who have accessibility needs, and for the sustainable citizen who wishes to minimise his/her impact on the planet. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. alternative hedonism; COVID-19; disruption; sustainable citizen; Technology  Serological assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), March 2020 Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has major impacts on health systems, the economy and society. Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions. We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making. Aim: Our objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies. Methods: We developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT90) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls. Results: IgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT90 were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls. We found that PRNT90 tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge. Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test. Conclusion: Using IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT90, is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies. © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Although less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, it has taken several lives and taken down the economies of many coun-tries. Before this outbreak, the most recent coronavi-rus outbreaks were the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV outbreaks that happened in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Since, the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, they share several similarities. So, this review aims at un-derstanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses. Studies re-veal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses. The presence of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the S protein priming and might increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other beta coronaviruses. So, furin inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the tensor train decomposition approach is presented as a global convergence algorithm. The idea of the proposed method is to extract the tensor structure of the optimized functional and use it for multidimensional optimization problems. Secondly, for the refinement of the unknown parameters, three local optimization approaches are implemented and compared: Nelder-Mead simplex method, gradient method of minimum errors, adaptive gradient method. For gradient methods, the evident formula for the continuous gradient of the misfit function is obtained. The identification problem for the diffusive logistic mathematical model which can be applied to social sciences (online social networks), economy (spatial Solow model) and epidemiology (coronavirus COVID-19, HIV, etc.) is considered. The numerical results for information propagation in online social network are presented and discussed. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020. gradient method; Inverse problem; optimization; parameter estimation; partial differential equations; regularization; social network; tensor train; tensor train decomposition Boundary value problems; Gradient methods; Information dissemination; Linear programming; Tensors; Adaptive gradient methods; Decomposition approach; Identification problem; Information propagation; Minimization problems; Multidimensional optimization; Nelder-Mead simplex methods; On-line social networks; Social networking (online) Rethinking international subsidy rules Geo-economic tensions, notably associated with the rise of China, and global collective action problems—climate change and the COVID-19pandemic—call for international cooperation to revise and develop rules to guide both the use of domestic subsidies and responses by governments to cross-border competition spillover effects. Current WTO rules dividing all subsidies into prohibited or actionable categories are no longer fit for purpose. Piecemeal efforts in preferential trade agreements and bi- or trilateral configurations offer a basis on which to build but are too narrow in scope. Addressing spillover effects of subsidies could start with G20 countries launching a work programme to mobilise an epistemic community concerned with subsidy policies, tasked with building a more solid evidence base on the magnitude, purpose and effects of subsidy policies. The need for such cooperation has become even more pressing by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated increase in the use of subsidy programmes in major economies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd G20; international cooperation; spillovers; Subsidy policies; WTO  Democracy and Entrepreneurship Entrepreneurship has been claimed to matter and deserve priority because it has been linked to some of the most compelling economic and social issues of our time. This paper suggests that entrepreneurship is also inextricably linked to a fundamental value common among the western developed economies, democracy. Three distinct contexts are examined to link democracy to entrepreneurship, two historical and one contemporary. The first is National Socialism in Germany, which emerged by suppressing both entrepreneurship and democracy. The second is the rise of the Trusts, or dominant large corporations and concomitant decline of small business in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. Finally, both measurement and perception suggest a decline in democracy as well as entrepreneurship in the contemporary era. These concerns are only exacerbated in the current Covid-19 crisis. The paper concludes that an important policy mandate for entrepreneurship may be to ensure the independent, decentralized and autonomous decision-making serving as a cornerstone of democracy. © The Author(s) 2020. authoritarianism; democracy; entrepreneurship; freedom; small business; start-ups; totalitarianism  Organizational participation in post-covid society–its contributions and enabling conditions The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the economic and social problems that societies face today. At the same time, the public response to the crisis points to a constructive way forward. It has brought people together and unleashed a desire to contribute in many ways, some small and others spectacular. It has demonstrated how opportunities for people to participate in collective activities both psychologically and behaviorally can achieve remarkable results, especially when addressing a common danger. This paper argues that it is timely to widen participation in organizational decision-making as an approach to addressing many of the problems which will continue to be with us post-Covid, and which indeed the pandemic has exacerbated. In order to arrive at practical policy options, it proceeds through the following stages. The first is to establish a working definition of organizational participation and to develop a framework for classifying its principal forms. This framework serves to identify the more advanced and consequential forms of participation, and is then used to structure an evidence-based review of how they can constructively contribute to economic and social improvement. The final part of the paper reviews conditions bearing on the practical implementation of participation and which serve to clarify practical policy implications. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Drawing upon feminist theory, we introduce the notion of ‘inclusiveness’ as a fresh conceptualization of the impact of meaning rendering from working, almost irrespective of where work takes place. The ‘new (ab)normal’ that is emerging, is challenging the future of corporations not only in fulfilling their purpose, but also in leading the future leadership necessary to restore the balance between the economy and ecology. In this respect, the corporation is more than a workplace, and leadership is more than a relational process. Inclusive leadership, as we will elaborate when ‘leading from home’, invites us to rethink social distancing and remote working as a platform for rebuilding the fundamentals of humanity. We propose an agenda for leading on leadership in co-creating the future of work and corporations by outlining themes as well as an approach to connecting that no longer separates research and business practice. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd future of corporation; future of work; inclusiveness; leading on leadership; meaningfulness; social distancing  Evaluation of medicinal herbs as a potential therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 targeting its main protease The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a worldwide pandemic and caused huge damage to the lives and economy of more than hundred countries. As on May 10, 2020, more than 4,153,300 people stand infected from the virus due to an unprecedented rate of transmission and 282,700 have lost their lives because of the disease. In this context, medicinal plants may provide a way to treat the disease by targeting specific essential proteins of the virus. We screened about 51 medicinal plants and found that Tea (Camellia sinensis) and Haritaki (Terminalia chebula) has potential against SARS-COV-2 3CLpro, with an IC50 for Green Tea as 8.9 ± 0.5 μg/ml and Haritaki 8.8 ± 0.5 μg/ml. The in-silico studies suggested that Tea component Thearubigins binds to the cysteine 145 of protease active site and could be a pharmacoactive molecule. We predict that the inhibition in protease activity may be able to halt the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and therefore, we propose Green Tea, Black Tea, and Haritaki plant extracts as potential therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation on role of bioactive constituents of extracts is needed to establish the molecular basis of inhibition and towards expedited drug discovery. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 3CLpro; Haritaki; medicinal plants; SARS-CoV-2; tea  The Final Frontier: China, Taiwan, and the United States in Strategic Competition for Central America China’s rise as a global power corresponded with a diminution of Taiwanese diplomacy, which has left Central America as the last region to host a continuous bloc of countries that recognize the ROC. In this article, we argue that China’s success in gaining diplomatic recognition from Taiwan’s former allies has largely resulted from China's economic policy, specifically its promises of large-scale infrastructure projects and the integration of Central American economies with Chinese markets. However, there are limits to how far China has advanced in gaining full recognition from the region. The competing political and economic interests of China, Taiwan, the United States, and the Central American countries themselves, continue to influence patterns of diplomatic switching. More specifically, we argue that the threat of punitive measures from the United States combined with a turn in Taiwanese diplomacy toward assistance efforts to combat Covid-19 may deter future switching in the short to medium-term. Our analysis offers case studies of four Central American countries (Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador and Nicaragua) to illustrate the multi-year processes by which China’s economic strategy leads to diplomatic switching and examine the paths ahead for the remaining holdouts facing the prospect of economic and political penalties by the United States. © 2020, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies. Chinese investments in Central America; Dollar diplomacy; Taiwanese recognition  Integrated approaches to reveal mechanisms by which RNA viruses reprogram the cellular environment RNA viruses are major threats to global society and mass outbreaks can cause long-lasting damage to international economies. RNA and related retro viruses represent a large and diverse family that contribute to the onset of human diseases such as AIDS; certain cancers like T cell lymphoma; severe acute respiratory illnesses as seen with COVID-19; and others. The hallmark of this viral family is the storage of genetic material in the form of RNA, and upon infecting host cells, their RNA genomes reprogram the cellular environment to favor productive viral replication. RNA is a multifunctional biomolecule that not only stores and transmits heritable information, but it also has the capacity to catalyze complex biochemical reactions. It is therefore no surprise that RNA viruses use this functional diversity to their advantage to sustain chronic or lifelong infections. Efforts to subvert RNA viruses therefore requires a deep understanding of the mechanisms by which these pathogens usurp cellular machinery. Here, we briefly summarize several experimental techniques that individually inform on key physicochemical features of viral RNA genomes and their interactions with proteins. Each of these techniques provide important vantage points to understand the complexities of virus-host interactions, but we attempt to make the case that by integrating these and similar methods, more vivid descriptions of how viruses reprogram the cellular environment emerges. These vivid descriptions should expedite the identification of novel therapeutic targets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.   Macroprudential policy and the probability of a banking crisis The ultimate purpose of macroprudential policy is to avoid financial instability, such as banking crises, which have a long-lasting and devastating effect on the economy. Although a growing number of studies have examined the effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth, few empirical studies have analyzed its effect on the probability of a banking crisis. Does macroprudential policy actually affect the probability of a banking crisis? Do other macroeconomic policies matter for the effectiveness of macroprudential policy? To answer these questions, this paper empirically investigates the effect of macroprudential policy on the probability of a banking crisis and its relationship with other macroeconomic policies. Specifically, using data on 65 countries from 2000 to 2016, we employ a probit model to analyze the effect of changes in the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on crisis probability. Our results show that macroprudential policy is effective in changing the probability of a banking crisis via a credit channel and that its effectiveness depends on other macroeconomic policies. Changes in the LTV ratio are found to be effective in influencing the probability of a banking crisis in countries that have inflation targeting frameworks, floating exchange rate regimes, and/or no capital controls. Our results underscore the importance of policy coordination among different government bodies to design an appropriate macroprudential policy, especially in the current context of the Covid-19 crisis. © 2020 The Society for Policy Modeling Banking crisis; Capital control; Exchange rate regime; Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio; Macroprudential policy  The shifting preferences of patients and physicians in nonsurgical hair loss treatment Background: There are multiple etiologies for hair thinning and loss, including genetic, hormonal, immune, scaring, and infectious. Hair loss treatment involves both surgical intervention and nonsurgical therapies such as pharmaceuticals, haircare products, vitamins, and low-level laser therapy (LLLT). While pharmaceuticals have been extensively researched, the efficacy of other therapies remains inconclusive. With so many available treatments, consumers often research their options using search engines such as Google and/or seek help from hair restoration physicians. Aims: To identify and analyze changing trends in international consumer and physician interest in nonsurgical hair loss therapies. Methods: Worldwide trends in Google searches of hair loss products (2004-2020) were compared with product prescription frequency surveys from members of the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (2004-2019, ~29% response rate). Results: Minoxidil and finasteride were the most prescribed hair loss treatments, while “minoxidil” was the most “Googled” term. Generic products were searched more often than their brand counterparts. Nutritionals and haircare prescriptions increased over time. LLLT was also increasingly prescribed, with Internet searches increasing following government regulation announcements. The COVID-19 pandemic initially negatively affected hair loss treatment searches, which have since returned to, and surpassed, pre-pandemic levels. Conclusion: Regulations and social media have influence on consumer interest in hair loss products. A weak economy and coronavirus fears may persuade consumers to turn to cheaper hair loss treatment alternatives. Hair restoration specialists need to keep abreast of online trends to communicate effectively with their patients. Patients should be cognizant of the safety and efficacy of hair restoration treatments. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC Google; hair growth; hair loss; ISHRS; laser treatment; minoxidil  Perception of health risks in Lao market vendors Wet markets are a critical part of South-East Asian culture and economy. However, their role in circulation and transmission of both endemic and emerging disease is a source of concern in a region considered a hotspot of disease emergence. In the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR, Laos), live and dead wild animals are frequently found in wet markets, despite legislation against the bushmeat trade. This is generally considered to increase the risk of disease transmission and emergence, although whether or not wildlife vendors themselves have indeed increased incidence of zoonotic disease has rarely been assessed. In preparation for a future longitudinal study of market vendors investigating vendors’ exposure to zoonotic pathogens, we conducted a pilot survey of Lao market vendors of wildlife meat, livestock meat and vegetables, to identify demographic characteristics and potential control groups within markets. We also investigated baseline risk perception for infectious diseases among market vendors and assessed the association between risk perception and risk mitigation behaviours. The surveys conducted with 177 vendors revealed similar age, sex, ethnic background and geographical origin between vendor types, but differences in professional background and work history for livestock meat vendors. The perception of disease risk was very low across all vendors, as was the reported use of personal protective equipment, and the two appeared unrelated. Personal risk discounting and assumptions about transmission routes may explain this lack of association. This information will help inform the development of future research, risk communication and risk mitigation policy, especially in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 The Authors.

While the events directly affecting the world population are concentrated on certain masses, the perception of the society is also affected in this direction and creates cultural changes. One of these global problems is Covid-19 pandemic, which began to spread from Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. WHO declared covid-19 caused by corona virus as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. It spreads rapidly through the respiratory tract and is declared to result in death, especially in patients with chronic diseases and the elderly. It is supported by cultural codes that pandemic is a respiratory disease that increases the risk of death of the elderly population and follows different policies around treatment, care, prevention and protection according to the development level of the countries. Being under direct risk, the elderly population over the age of 65 and those with chronic illnesses in Turkey faced curfew on March 22 and protection approaches are intended to be taken for the elderly population. It is predicted that the risk of transmission will increase compared to the density of the elderly population and measures have been taken accord-ingly. It should be emphasized that the epidemic process and the measures taken affect the aging culture, and cultural changes should be determined by taking into consideration the rate of increase in the population. In this way, revealing the value gains and losses of the elderly in the society and the change experienced by the culture of the aging through the epidemic process will be evaluated in terms of folklore. When the policies of the state are analyzed, the viewpoint of the society towards the elderly and the vital value of the elderly can change. For this reason, it is necessary to reveal the difference between the policies pursued by the state from the policies followed in other world states and to determine the culture-based approaches. Policies on health, economy, socialization, physical isolation, social support and the protection and preventive measures implemented in this context have enabled the change of the culture of elderliness and the change in the society’s perception of elderly in remembering, longing, belonging, fear and anxiety arising from the loss of their value attract attention. How the elderly perceive the epidemic, how they reflect their feelings and perceptions on social media, and their attitude towards the reactions have been directly influential in the regaining of their social roles. The obligatory contact of the elderly group with technology took place in this period and acquiring the right information through the media has gained importance in terms of ease of access to information. Since the prevention of socialization with the curfew only covers the physical distance, communication with people continued remotely through technology, neighbors, friends, balconies, building spaces, etc. and it is thought that communication has been used more intensively with the change of size. When those who comply with the decisions implemented by the state within the scope of health measures and those who do not comply are evaluated, it can be concluded that the perception of aging in the society gains value. It can be said that the approach established by the state on protection and trust is based on respect and love for the elderly in culture.

"2","8","Redesigning Supply Chains using Blockchain-Enabled Circular Economy and COVID-19 Experiences The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed businesses and societies to the shortfalls of normal patterns of production, consumption, and their long-lasting impact on supply chains. In this opinion paper, we provide insights from the COVID-19 pandemic for making supply chains more resilient, transparent, and sustainable. These insights include supply chains needing to develop localization, agility, and digitization (LAD) characteristics. We link LAD to a potential solution using blockchain technology and circular economy principle capabilities. Use cases are used to show how blockchain-enabled circular economy practices can support supply chain LAD efforts. Supply chain tracking, tracing, and responsiveness can be supported through blockchain-enabled circular economy practices. One result of identifying these relationships include solutions and insights at multiple levels and stakeholders – individual, organizational, supply chain, governmental, and community. These crisis-related observations and findings set a future research foundation for sustainable production and consumption. © 2020 Agility; Blockchain technology; Circular economy; COVID-19; Digitization; Localization; Supply chain sustainability  Urban flooding events pose risks of virus spread during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic Since the first report in December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to most parts of the world, with over 21.5 million people infected and nearly 768,000 deaths to date. Evidence suggests that transmission of the virus is primarily through respiratory droplets and contact routes, and airborne carriers such as atmospheric particulates and aerosols have also been proposed as important vectors for the environmental transmission of COVID-19. Sewage and human excreta have long been recognized as potential routes for transmitting human pathogens. The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been detected in human feces and urine, where it could remain viable for days and show infectivity. Urban flooding, a common threat in summer caused by heavy rainfalls, is frequently reported in urban communities along with sewage overflows. With summer already underway and economy re-opening in many parts of the world, urban flooding and the often-accompanied sewage overflows could jeopardize previous mitigation efforts by posing renewed risks of virus spread in affected areas and communities. In this article, we present the up-to-date evidence and discussions on sewage-associated transmission of COVID-19, and highlighted the roles of sewage overflow and sewage-contaminated aerosols in two publicized events of community outbreaks. Further, we collected evidence in real-life environments to demonstrate the shortcuts of exposure to overflowed sewage and non-dispersed human excreta during a local urban flooding event. Given that communities serviced by combined sewer systems are particularly prone to such risks, local municipalities could prioritize wastewater infrastructure upgrades and consider combined sewer separations to minimize the risks of pathogen transmission via sewage overflows during epidemics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, such predictions will likely be aggravated by the excessive use and consumption of single-use plastics (including personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves) due to COVID-19 pandemic. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the effects of COVID-19 on macroplastic pollution and its potential implications on the environment and human health considering short- and long-term scenarios; addressing the main challenges and discussing potential strategies to overcome them. It emphasises that future measures, involved in an emergent health crisis or not, should reflect a balance between public health and environmental safety as they are both undoubtedly connected. Although the use and consumption of plastics significantly improved our quality of life, it is crucial to shift towards sustainable alternatives, such as bio-based plastics. Plastics should remain in the top of the political agenda in Europe and across the world, not only to minimise plastic leakage and pollution, but to promote sustainable growth and to stimulate both green and blue- economies. Discussions on this topic, particularly considering the excessive use of plastic, should start soon with the involvement of the scientific community, plastic producers and politicians in order to be prepared for the near future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (βCoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The surge mitigation is complicated and associates many factors, including the pandemic status, policy, socioeconomics and resident behaviours. Modelling and analytics with spatial-temporal big urban data are required to assist the mitigation of the pandemic. This study proposes a novel perspective to analyse the spatial-temporal potential exposure risk of residents by capturing human behaviours based on spatial-temporal car park availability data. Near real-time data from 1,904 residential car parks in Singapore, a classical megacity, are collected to analyse car mobility and its spatial-temporal heat map. The implementation of the circuit breaker, a COVID-19 measure, in Singapore has reduced the mobility and heat (daily frequency of mobility) significantly at about 30.0%. It contributes to a 44.3%–55.4% reduction in the transportation-related air emissions under two scenarios of travelling distance reductions. Urban sustainability impacts in both environment and economy are discussed. The spatial-temporal potential exposure risk mapping with space-time interactions is further investigated via an extended Bayesian spatial-temporal regression model. The maximal reduction rate of the defined potential exposure risk lowers to 37.6% by comparison with its peak value. The big data analytics of changes in car mobility behaviour and the resultant potential exposure risks can provide insights to assist in (a) designing a flexible circuit breaker exit strategy, (b) precise management via identifying and tracing hotspots on the mobility heat map, and (c) making timely decisions by fitting curves dynamically in different phases of COVID-19 mitigation. The proposed method has the potential to be used by decision-makers worldwide with available data to make flexible regulations and planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Air-emission reduction; Car mobility behaviour; COVID-19; Flexible lockdown strategy; Risk mitigation; Spatial-temporal analysis Advanced Analytics; Behavioral research; Curve fitting; Data Analytics; Decision making; Electric circuit breakers; Flexible electronics; Garages (parking); Regression analysis; Flexible circuit; Human behaviours; Near real-time datum; Potential exposure; Regression model; Space-time interactions; Spatial temporals; Urban sustainability; Sustainable development The interplay of circular economy with industry 4.0 enabled smart city drivers of healthcare waste disposal Generation of healthcare waste from different patient care activities in hospitals, pathology labs and research centres has been a matter of great concern for environmental and social bodies across the world. This concern comes from its infectious and hazardous nature which brings life taking disease such as human immunodeficiency virus and Hepatitis-B. Moreover, with the outbreak of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic across the world, healthcare waste has become even more infectious like never before and showing its potential for claiming lives if not disposed properly. Additionally, the COVID-19 has put up another challenge in terms of exponentially increasing demand for personal protective equipments for healthcare workers such as doctors, nurses, ward boys, and sanitation workers. In this paper, seven criteria related to smart healthcare waste disposal system infused by circular economy aspects to recover value from disposables are identified and analysed using a decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The criteria have been prioritized by its importance and net cause and effect relationship through a causal diagram. Two criteria, (i) digitally connected healthcare centres, waste disposal firms and pollution control board, and (ii) providing a pollution control board's feedback app to public and other stakeholders, feature as strong reasons for a smart healthcare waste disposal system. Conclusively, this study provides a causal relationship model among the intertwined drivers of industry 4.0 and circular economy for developing a smart healthcare waste disposal system enriched with the benefits of circular economy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Circular economy; COVID-19; Healthcare waste; Industry 4.0; IoT; Multi-criteria decision making; Smart city Decision making; Economic and social effects; Health care; Industrial economics; Industry 4.0; Pollution control; Protective clothing; Smart city; Viruses; Causal relationship models; Cause-and-effect relationships; Connected healthcares; Decision making trial and evaluation laboratories; Healthcare wastes; Healthcare workers; Human immunodeficiency virus; Personal protective equipment; Waste disposal The moral and political economy of the pandemic in Bangladesh: Weak states and strong societies during Covid-19 As the Covid-19 pandemic spread in 2020, the government of Bangladesh ordered a lockdown and promised a program of relief. Citizens complied at first, but soon returned to economic and social life; relief proved slow and uncertain, and citizens could not rely on government assistance. The government tacitly and then officially permitted the lockdown to end, despite a rising Covid-19 caseload. This article draws on theories about state capacity to make and enforce policy to understand why Bangladesh proved unable to sustain a lockdown deemed necessary to contain the pandemic in this densely populated, low income country. Drawing on original qualitative mobile phone-based research in six selected communities, this article examines how the state exercised its capacities for coercion, control over lower factions within political society, and sought to preserve and enhance its legitimacy. It concludes that despite a) the growth in the capacity of the Bangladeshi state in the past decade and b) strong political incentives to manage the pandemic without harm to economic wellbeing, the pressures to sustain legitimacy with the masses forced the state and its frontline actors to tolerate lockdown rule-breaking, conceding that the immediate livelihood needs of the poor masses overrode national public health concerns. Chronically unable to enforce its authority over local political elites, the state failed to ensure a fair and timely distribution of relief. The weakness of the Bangladeshi state contrasts with the strength of widely shared ‘moral economy’ views within society, which provided powerful ethical and political justification for citizens’ failures to comply with the lockdown, and for officials’ forbearance in its enforcement. The Covid-19 pandemic highlights both the importance of state capacity in managing novel shocks from within the global system, and the challenges in settings where weak states are embedded in strong societies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Bangladesh; Covid-19; Moral economy; Social protection; State capacity COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; political economy; public health; respiratory disease; state; viral disease; Bangladesh A critical review of the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and ecosystems and opportunities for circular economy strategies The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, but the world is still reeling from its aftermath. Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus. These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Impact analysis of COVID-19 on ship recycling using Weibull tonnage estimation and scenario analysis method The sustainability of the ship recycling industry strongly linked with the global shipping market and international commodity flows. More than 80% of the End of Life (EoL) ships are dismantled in South Asian countries, namely Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Due to measures taken to minimize the propagation of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an international supply chain is broken to a historic low, except for certain medical-related urgencies. Due to the disruption of global supply chains, the industry may submerge into uncertainty due to, perhaps, lack of adequate labor force to dismantle increased EoL ships and due to disturbances of vessel transportation to the recycling nations amid strong precautionary measures. Our estimate suggests that about 300 million Gross Tonnage (GT) available for demolition in the next five years and the inability to get them recycled would cost about 20 billion dollars. More importantly, South Asian recycling nations would suffer from economic losses and employment opportunities. In this study, we also apply a scenario analysis technique to understand the impact range of COVID-19 in the short term and in the long term. The disruption is viewed through a circular economy framework, identifying a critical lack of ‘global scale’ acknowledgment in the circular economy framework. This article suggests that a formalized global scale, paralleled with favorable policies, may reduce supply chain disruption and improve sustainable development in the receiving nations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. circular economy; COVID-19; disruption response; global circular economy; scenario analysis; ship recycling Losses; Ships; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Employment opportunities; Global supply chain; International supply chains; Precautionary measures; Scenario analysis; Scenario analysis techniques; Supply-chain disruptions; Recycling; COVID-19; environmental economics; estimation method; recycling; regional economy; respiratory disease; scenario analysis; vessel; viral disease; Weibull theory; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; economic recession; lifespan; mathematical model; recycling; socioeconomics; Bangladesh; India; Pakistan; Coronavirus Whatever it takes? The global financial safety net, Covid-19, and developing countries Multilateral financial institutions have pledged to do whatever it takes to enable emerging market and developing countries to fill a $2.5 trillion financing gap to combat Covid-19 and subsequent economic crises. In this article, we present new datasets to track the extent to which multilateral financial institutions are meeting these goals, and conduct a preliminary assessment of progress to date. We find that the International Monetary Fund and the principal regional financial arrangements have made relatively trivial amounts of new financing available and have been slow to disburse the financing at their disposal. As of July 31, 2020, these institutions had committed $89.56 billion in loans and $550 million in currency swaps, totaling $90.11 billion—just 12.6% of their current capacity. The new datasets allow scholars, policymakers, and civil society to continue to track these trends, and eventually examine the impact of such financing on health and development outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Covid-19; Global economic governance; Global financial safety net; International Monetary Fund; Regional financial arrangements COVID-19; data set; developing world; finance; global economy; governance approach; IMF; regional economy The impact of COVID 19 on air pollution levels and other environmental indicators - A case study of Egypt The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only affected health and economics, but also its effect extended to include other aspects, such as the environment. Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country's economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015–2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic. Therefore, stricter laws must be enacted to protect the environment in Egypt. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Absorbing aerosol index; Carbon monoxide and ozone; COVID-19; Environmental impacts in Egypt; Medical and municipal solid wastes; Nitrogen dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; disease prevalence; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; groundwater pollution; nitrogen dioxide; recycling; satellite data; solid waste; viral disease; Alexandria [Egypt]; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt; Coronavirus Challenges and strategies for effective plastic waste management during and post COVID-19 pandemic The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the complexities of plastic waste management. Our improved, hyper-hygienic way of life in the fear of transmission has conveniently shifted our behavioral patterns like the use of PPE (Personal protective equipment), increased demand for plastic-packaged food and groceries, and the use of disposable utensils. The inadequacies and inefficiencies of our current waste management system to deal with the increased dependence on plastic could aggravate its mismanagement and leakage into the environment, thus triggering a new environmental crisis. Mandating scientific sterilization and the use of sealed bags for safe disposal of contaminated plastic wastes should be an immediate priority to reduce the risk of transmission to sanitation workers. Investments in circular technologies like feedstock recycling, improving the infrastructure and environmental viability of existing techniques could be the key to dealing with the plastic waste fluxes during such a crisis. Transition towards environmentally friendly materials like bioplastics and harboring new sustainable technologies would be crucial to fighting future pandemics. Although the rollbacks and relaxation of single-use plastic bans may be temporary, their likely implications on the consumer perception could hinder our long-term goals of transitioning towards a circular economy. Likewise, any delay in building international willingness and participation to curb any form of pollution through summits and agendas may also delay its implementation. Reduction in plastic pollution and at the same time promoting sustainable plastic waste management technologies can be achieved by prioritizing our policies to instill individual behavioral as well as social, institutional changes. Incentivizing measures that encourage circularity and sustainable practices, and public-private investments in research, infrastructure and marketing would help in bringing the aforementioned changes. Individual responsibility, corporate action, and government policy are all necessary to keep us from transitioning from one disaster to another. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The world economy is very threatened by the new situation, which has not bypassed the energy sector either. The mortality rate is relatively high, people are not leaving their homes, which is directly reflected in the increase of the energy consumption in the residential sector. The same is valid for water consumption. For a household located in Kragujevac (Central Serbia), 4 simulation scenarios were analyzed (S1 – reference case, S2 – mild protection measures, S3 – semi-quarantine measures, S4 – complete quarantine) to assess the link between people's behavior (on the one hand) and the consumption of natural gas, electricity and water (on the other hand), in the residential sector, in unforeseen circumstances, such as the COVID-19 virus pandemic. The analysis was conducted numerically for the month of March 2020, using EnergyPlus software packages. In defining the above scenarios, a one-minute time step schedule of people's behavior was used, taking into account the number of family members in the household, their age, occupation, lifestyle, habits (all in accordance with cultural and socio-economic circumstances), as well as the measures taken by the Government of the Republic of Serbia to fight the pandemic. Also, an analysis of energy consumption at the level of the city of Kragujevac for the past three years was made, based on data obtained from public companies – distributors (thermal energy, natural gas, electricity, water). In this paper, an analysis of air quality for the same time period was conducted, which is closely related to energy consumption and limited population movement. The simulatinos show that the consumption of natural gas can increase by 21.26% (S2), electricity by 58.39% (S4), and the consumption of water from the city water supply network by 25.45% (S3) compared to the reference case (S1). On the other hand, based on the invoice for payment of services to distributors, the actual energy consumption that was made on the analyzed house during the month of March 2020 was: natural gas (260.36 Sm3), electricity (1418 kWh), and water (22.5 m3). The conducted economic analysis showed that the largest funds at the level of the entire facility were allocated in S3 (27.33% more than in S1), and that the actual costs were 15.09% higher than in S1, and 16.41% lower than in S2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The error correction terms (ECT) and cointegration processing tools have been applied in studies for identifying possible transmission mechanisms between distinct time series. This paper adopts the vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate the dynamic coupling between the pandemics (e.g., the COVID-19, EBOLA, MERS and SARS) and the evolution of key stocks exchange indices (e.g., Dow-Jones, S&P 500, EuroStoxx, DAX, CAC, Nikkei, HSI, Kospi, S&P ASX, Nifty and Ibov). The results show that the shocks caused by the diseases significantly affected the markets. Nonetheless, except for the COVID-19, the stock exchange indices reveal a sustained and fast recovering when an identical length time window of 79 days is analyzed. In addition, our findings contribute to point a higher volatility for all financial indices during the COVID-19, a strong impact over the Ibov-Brazil and its poor recover when compared to the other indices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. Cointegration; COVID-19; Disease outbreaks; Market dynamics  Degradation and disease: Ecologically unequal exchanges cultivate emerging pandemics An estimated 75 percent of new infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin, directly resulting from human and animal interactions (CDC, 2017). New diseases like COVID-19 most often originate from biodiversity hotspots such as tropical rainforests, and forest loss represents one of the most significant forms of environmental degradation facilitating new human and animal interactions. A political-economy approach illuminates how trade inequalities lead to the exploitation of the environment and people in poor nations, creating conditions under which pandemics like COVID-19 appear. Cross-national patterns in deforestation and forest use illuminate how consumers in the Global North are keenly tied to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd  Animalia Unlocking challenges and opportunities presented by COVID-19 pandemic for cross-cutting disruption in agri-food and green deal innovations: Quo Vadis? COVID-19 pandemic is on a trajectory to cause catastrophic global upheaval with the potential to alter geopolitical and socio-economic norms. Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first ‘Green Deal’ initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19. Candidate areas for future consideration will focus on climate action, digitization, manufacturing, and sustainable food production, security, and waste mitigation. Recommendations are also provided to facilitate community transitioning, training, enterprise, and employment to low carbon economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It is likely that the negative impacts for women and families will last for years without proactive interventions. What we commonly refer to as “the economy” would not function without the (often unrecognized) foundation of work provided by the “care economy”: the reproduction of everyday life through cooking, raising children, and so forth. The paid economy has slowed not only because people are physically not allowed into workplaces, but also because many families currently need to raise and educate their children without institutional support, which is reducing remunerated working hours and increasing stress. It has long been recognized that gross domestic product ignores the care economy and heterodox economists have promoted alternative economic systems that could value care work and facilitate a fairer sharing of domestic labor while promoting environmental and economic sustainability. This policy brief builds on recent work on the care economy to explore implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and opportunities for addressing the burden of unpaid care work. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

These workers and their dependents are in a socially vulnerable and economically difficult situation due to the dire impacts of the COVID-19. Migrant workers from Bangladesh in other countries are facing adverse impacts such as unemployment, short working hours, isolation, poor quality of living, social discrimination and mental pressure while their dependents at home are facing financial crisis due to the limited or reduced cash flow from their working relatives. A significant number of migrant workers have been sent back to Bangladesh and many are in constant fear of being sent back due to the impacts of COVID-19 in their host countries. Thus, COVID-19 intensifies numerous socio-economic crises such as joblessness, consumption of reserve funds by family members, and shrinking of the country's remittance inflow. In this situation, the most urgent and important need is to give financial security and social safety to the workers abroad and those who have returned to Bangladesh. Apart from diplomatic endeavors to maintain the status quo of policy, the government of Bangladesh may take initiatives to provide financial support to these workers as a short-term strategy to overcome hardships during the pandemic and design a comprehensive plan with a detailed database of all migrant workers to create a need-based and skilled workforce as a long-term solution. These strategies can mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 at present and address migration related problems in future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Migrant workers; National economy; Remittance; Unemployment, Bangladesh  The impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on faith-based investments: An original analysis This paper examines the rapid spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) and its short-term impact on the Shariah-compliant UK Dow Jones market index to capture the dynamic behavior of stock returns at economy and industry levels. Using daily data over the period January 20 to May 20 and ten UK industrial sector groupings, the findings suggest a strong and statistically significant relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the performance of the conventional stock market index. The findings also suggest that the disease interacts negatively but insignificantly with the Dow Jones faith-based ethical (Islamic) index compared to its UK counterpart. In addition, through an analysis of sector groupings, the paper shows that the stock returns of the information technology sector performed significantly better than the market, while stock returns of consumer discretionary sector, which includes transportation, beverages, tourism and leisure, consumer services performed significantly worse than the market during the COVID-19 outbreak. Other sector groupings fail to yield significantly plausible parameter values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe has resulted a newer challenge and paradigm for an evolving socio-scientific priorities. It is generally expected that the impacts of the pandemic would be in shorter time-scale, while the planned time and pathway for attaining the SDG are typically mandated in longer-term, hence may remain mostly unaffected. However, the stringent lockdown measures, isolated economies and financial burden to contain the pandemic emergency have resulted to slowdown of socio-economic development, which if continues for a longer period, would put a question mark on developing plans and pathways to achieve the SDGs, even in decadal-scale. Hence, in these newer times, it is important to understand the real priorities of availability of clean water and air, which are already stressed worldwide and in India, because of various natural and human-influenced triggers. This ongoing pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the impact of human development and consequent feedback of nature and human society in pre- and post-COVID scenarios on water–air–human life, which can help to re-think and re-orient the societal development priorities. It is a rare opportunity for scientists to impress the policy-makers with real-time examples on the efficacies of potential mitigation strategies for climate change, water and air pollution, and the importance of enduring investment on environmental causes and consequent benefits that can secure health and development for our future generations.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as an emerging therapeutic option for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, numerous clinical trials have been registered to examine the safety and efficacy of different types of MSCs and their exosomes for treating COVID-19 patients, with less published data on the mechanism of action. Although there is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19 as of yet, MSC therapies showed an improvement in the treatment of some COVID-19 patients. MSC’s therapeutic effect is displayed in their ability to reduce the cytokine storm, enhance alveolar fluid clearance, and promote epithelial and endothelial recovery; however, the safest and most effective route of MSC delivery remains unclear. The use of poorly characterized MSC products remains one of the most significant drawbacks of MSC-based therapy, which could theoretically promote the risk for thromboembolism. Optimizing the clinical-grade production of MSCs and establishing a consensus on registered clinical trials based on cell-product characterization and mode of delivery would aid in laying the foundation for a safe and effective therapy in COVID-19. In this review, we shed light on the mechanistic view of MSC therapeutic role based on preclinical and clinical studies on acute lung injury and ARDS; therefore, offering a unique correlation and applicability in COVID-19 patients. We further highlight the challenges and opportunities in the use of MSC-based therapy. © 2020, The Author(s).

The catastrophic impact a pandemic has on humans and economy should serve as a reminder to be better prepared to the advent of known and unknown pathogens in the future. The goal of having a set of initiatives and procedures to tackle them is the need of the hour. Rapid detection and point-of-care (POC) analysis of pathogens causing these diseases is not only a problem entailing the scientific community but also raises challenges in tailoring appropriate treatment strategies to the healthcare sector. Among the various methods used to detect pathogens, Electrochemical Biosensor Technology is at the forefront in the development of POC devices. Electrochemical Biosensors stand in good stead due to their rapid response, high sensitivity and selectivity and ease of miniaturization to name a few advantages. This review explores the innovations in electrochemical biosensing based on the various electroanalytical techniques including voltammetry, impedance, amperometry and potentiometry and discusses their potential in diagnosis of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (Re-EIDs), which are potential pandemic threats. © 2020 Amperometry; Corona Virus; COVID-19; Impedance; Potentiometry; Voltammetry Biosensors; Diagnosis; Electroanalytical techniques; Electrochemical biosensing; Electrochemical biosensor; Emerging infectious disease; Healthcare sectors; High sensitivity; Re-emerging infectious disease; Scientific community; Diseases Living to Spend Another Day: Exploring Resilience as a New Fourth Goal of Ecological Economics The three main goals of ecological economic theory seek to predict and prevent system breakdowns. However chaos theory and human uncertainty/ignorance guarantee that shocks, breakdowns and catastrophes like COVID-19 will increasingly occur due to converging environmental resource crises. The challenge then is designing a resilient (safe-fail) economy that can endure, adapt to and successfully recover from breakdowns and avoid collapse. To date little attention has been paid in ecological economics to the implications of resilience for broader economic decisions affecting the design of global civilization. This paper provides a general introduction to resilience and an argument for why it should become a much larger focus of ecological economic research going forward. Five arguments are advanced for why resilience should not be subsumed under an existing goal, including that efforts to build resilience have the potential to both complement and contradict the other three goals, especially efficiency. The Resilience Alliance‘s adaptive cycle highlighting the cost to resilience of increasing scale and complexity meshes readily with ecological economist's own critiques of growth, encouraging increased collaboration between these transdisciplines. The need to further study these tensions provides justification for adding “Resilient Design” as a distinct fourth policy goal to core ecological economic theory. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It has caused 9+ million confirmed cases and 400,000+ deaths at the time of writing and triggered unprecedented preventative measures that have confined a substantial portion of the global population and established ‘social distancing’ as a new global behavioral norm. The COVID-19 crisis has affected all aspects of everyday life and work, and heavily impacted the global economy. This crisis also offers unprecedented insights into how the global climate crisis may be managed, as there are many parallels between the COVID-19 crisis and what we expect from the imminent global climate emergency. Reflecting upon the challenges of today's crisis may help us better prepare for the future. Here we compile a list, by no means comprehensive, of the similarities and differences between the two crises, and the lessons we can learn from them: (i) High momentum trends, (ii) Irreversible changes, (iii) Social and spatial inequality, (iv) Weakening of international solidarity, and (v) Less costly to prevent than to cure. © 2020 Climate change; Climate emergency; COVID-19 Environmental engineering; Pollution; Global climates; Global economies; Global population; Irreversible changes; Climate change; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; climate change; COVID-19; economic impact; global climate; global economy; respiratory disease; viral disease; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; coronavirus disease 2019; daily life activity; economic recession; financial management; health care disparity; human; incidence; incubation time; infection prevention; international cooperation; isolation; job performance; pandemic; priority journal; resource management; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social aspect; social distance; social status; unemployment; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Climate Change; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Covid-19 pandemic and food: Present knowledge, risks, consumers fears and safety Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that has paralyzed social life and the economy around the world since the end of 2019, and which has so far killed nearly 600,000 people. The rapidity of its spread and the lack of detailed research on the course and methods of transmission significantly impede both its eradication and prevention. Scope and approach: Due to the high transmission rate and fatality resulting from COVID-19 disease, the paper focuses on analyzing the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 as well as its potential connection with food as a source of pathogen and infection. Key findings and conclusions: There is currently no evidence (scientific publications, WHO, EFSA etc.) that COVID-19 disease can spread directly through food and the human digestive system. However, according to the hypothesis regarding the primary transmission of the virus, the source of which was food of animal origin (meat of wild animals), as well as the fact that food is a basic necessity for humans, it is worth emphasizing that food can, if not directly, be a carrier of the virus. Particular attention should be paid to this indirect pathway when considering the potential for the spread of an epidemic and the development of prevention principles. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Food safety; Prevention; Virus transmission Animals; Digestive system; Transmissions; Viruses; Food of animal origin; High transmission rate; Primary transmission; Scientific publications; Social life; Wild animals; Diseases Distance education during the COVID-19 outbreak: A cross-sectional study among medical students in North of Jordan Introduction: In the spot of the new emerging COVID-19 pandemic and its major impact worldwide on day-to-day activities many rules had to be changed in order to fight this pandemic. Lockdown started in Jordan and around the globe affecting several aspects of life including economy, education, entertainment, and government policies. Regarding education, the priority was to ensure the safety and progress of the educational process. Thus, new methods of teaching had to be applied using the online learning at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), Faculty of Medicine. This study was done to assess (1) Class Experience (2) Students and Lecturers' Interaction (3) Online Learning Advantages & Disadvantages (4) Students’ Preference. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from the participants using a survey composed of 18 questions on Google Forms platform. A link was sent to the undergraduate medical students at the Jordan University of Science & Technology via their e-learning accounts (n = 3700). The form was available from May 22nd, 2020 to May 30th, 2020 for 8 days long. Data analysis was done using SPSS V 23. Results: 2212 out of 3700 students responded, (55.8%) of them were in the basic years and (44.2%) of them were in the clinical years. (55.8%) of students started to take online lectures after 3 weeks. (45.7%) used the hybrid teaching method (asynchronous and synchronous), (31.4%) used live classes, and 22.8% recorded classes. Zoom was the most used platform. (48.7%) and (57%) of clinical students and basic students express their interaction as bad, while the others had good and excellent interaction. Maintaining social distance was the most advantage of online teaching, while poor technical setup and no direct contact were the most disadvantage, furthermore inability to have real clinical access was a significant problem for clinical students (p <.001). With reference to students’ preferences 75% of students were not pleased with their experience and 42% of students prefer to integrate online learning with traditional learning. Conclusion: Most medical students at JUST preferred the traditional face-to-face teaching method over the solo online teaching methods with recommendations to convert to a more integrated educational system. Also, a well-established infrastructure should be done in involving online teaching. © 2020 The Author(s) Covid-19; Jordan; Medical students; Online learning  Can digitization mitigate the economic damage of a pandemic? Evidence from SARS The work presented in this paper uses empirical evidence to highlight the important role digital technology plays in mitigating a pandemic's economic disruption. As extensive datasets including the effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic are still unavailable, this study provides an assessment of the role of digitization at the time of SARS in 2003. Results are robust in pointing out that those countries with better broadband connectivity were able to mitigate some of the economic losses incurred by the pandemic. While anecdotal evidence is plentiful even for COVID-19, this study provides rigorous analysis to support that a reliable telecommunications infrastructure and a high level of digitization is crucial to keep the economy running under pandemic conditions. These results provide valuable evidence for the current context of COVID-19, which has resulted in several national lockdowns around the world. In consequence, we believe that the public and private sectors must collaborate and work together to promote the enhancement of the digital ecosystem. In the long run, a suitable regulatory framework seems crucial to stimulate private investments to close the digital supply gap, as well as promoting the digitization of business process and the training of the workforce to acquire digital skills. In the short term, we discuss several measures that can be taken to accommodate the expected increases in internet traffic in such circumstances and maintain the quality of service. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Digital ecosystem; Pandemics; Telecommunications Investments; Losses; Anecdotal evidences; Broadband connectivity; Digital technologies; Private investment; Public and private sector; Regulatory frameworks; Rigorous analysis; Telecommunications infrastructures; Quality of service Emotional, Behavioral, and Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 prompted consternation in many parts of the world. Due to its fast dissemination, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020. Aiming to contain the spread of the virus, leaders of many countries restrained social movement, targeting to flatten the curve of contamination with social distancing. This review aimed to analyze how human behavior has changed throughout this period. We also approached the key components of the emotional reaction to the pandemic, how internal and external factors, such as personality traits, gender, the media, the economy and the governmental response, influence the social perception of the pandemic and the psychological outcomes of the current scenario. Moreover, we explored in depth the groups at increased risk of suffering mental health burden secondary to these circumstances. These include the healthcare professionals, elderly individuals, children, college students, black subjects, latin and LGBTQ+ communities, economically disadvantaged groups, the homeless, prisoners, the rural population and psychiatric patients. We also discussed several measures that might minimize the emotional impact derived from this scenario. It is crucial that the health authorities, the government and the population articulate to assist the vulnerable groups and promote emotional and psychological support strategies. Moreover, it is fundamental that the population is provided with accurate information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Pedrosa, Bitencourt, Fróes, Cazumbá, Campos, de Brito and Simões e Silva. behavior; COVID-19; mental health; psychological changes; restricting measures; SARS-CoV-2; social isolation  COVID-19, the food system and the circular economy: Challenges and opportunities This paper analyzes the causes and effects of the COVID-19 crisis, with a specific focus on the food system. Food consumption and production has not only been impacted by the crisis, but it may have also contributed to causing the pandemic. After providing a brief introductory framework, the paper presents the results of a pilot study on the link between COVID-19 and the food system, as indicated by the social media activity of selected European Union (EU) Twitter accounts, measured using an original ""theme popularity"" metric. Thereafter, a systematic review of the literature is proposed to identify the causes of the rise in popularity of a sustainable food system theme, the potential consequences of the COVID-19 crisis for the food system (targeting the production, consumption and waste disposal phases) and possible solutions, focusing on the circular economy. Challenges and opportunities for policymakers in the short and long term are discussed. A holistic approach is advocated, as the global food system is intimately connected with society and requires deep cooperation among nation states and economic actors. © 2020 by the authors.

While one of the aspects of a pandemic is the loss of human life, the outbreak has multi-dimensional impacts across regional and global societies. In this paper, a comparative regressive and neural network model is developed to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) on the electricity and petroleum demand in China. The environmental analysis shows that the epidemic severeness significantly affects the electricity and the petroleum demand, both directly and indirectly. The outputs of the model stated that the elasticity of petroleum and electricity demand toward the population of the infected people is −0.1% and −0.65%, respectively. The mentioned results show that pandemic status has a significant impact on energy demand, and also its impacts can be tracked into every corner of human society. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Demand analysis; Economic impacts; Energy policy; Socio-economic analysis  A new approach for COVID-19 treatment by micro-RNA MicroRNAs (miRNAs) naturally occur in plants and all living organisms. They play an important role in gene regulation through binding toa specific region in open reading frames (ORFs) and/or untranslated regions (UTRs) to block the translation processes through either degrading or blocking mRNA resulting in knocking down or suppression of targeted genes. Plants and many organisms protect themselves from viruses through the production of miRNAs, which are complementary to 3UTR of viruses resulting in degrading the viral mRNA or block the translation on ribosomes. As pandemic, COVID-19, and its consequences on the global economy, we hypothesized a new approach for the treatment of COVID-19 paints. This approach includes designing a mix of miRNAs targeting several regions on COVID-19 open reading frame (ORF) and 3 UTR and suitable delivery system targeting respiratory system tissues. These synthesized miRNAs may be delivered to humansinnon-viral delivery systems such as liposomes like exosome (extracellular vesicle), polymer-based carriers, or inorganic nanoparticles, which are considered to be more suitable for human use. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; miRNAs; Treatment; Virus microRNA; virus RNA; 3' untranslated region; coronavirus disease 2019; gene sequence; gene targeting; human; Letter; nonhuman; open reading frame; pandemic; progeny; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virus genome Measuring imported case risk of COVID-19 from inbound international flights --- A case study on China With COVID-19 spreading around the world, many countries are exposed to the imported case risk from inbound international flights. Several governments issued restrictions on inbound flights to mitigate such risk. But with the pandemic controlled in many countries, some decide to reopen the economy by relaxing the international air travel bans. As the virus has still been prevailing in many regions, this relaxation raises the alarm to import overseas cases and results in the revival of local pandemic. This study proposes a risk index to measure one country's imported case risk from inbound international flights. The index combines both daily dynamic international air connectivity data and the updated global COVID-19 data. It can measure the risk at the country, province and even specific route level. The proposed index was applied to China, which is the first country to experience and control COVID-19 pandemic while later becoming exposed to high imported case risk after the epidemic centers switched to Europe and the US afterward. The calculated risk indexes for each Chinese province or region show both spatial and temporal patterns from January to April 2020. It is found that China's strict restriction on inbound flights since March 26 was very effective to cut the imported case risk by half than doing nothing. But the overall index level kept rising because of the deteriorating pandemic conditions around the world. Hong Kong and Taiwan are the regions facing the highest imported case risk due to their superior international air connectivity and looser restriction on inbound flights. Shandong Province had the highest risk in February and early March due to its well-developed air connectivity with South Korea and Japan when the pandemic peaked in these two countries. Since mid-March, the imported case risk from Europe and the US dramatically increased. Last, we discuss policy implications for the relevant stakeholders to use our index to dynamically adjust the international air travel restrictions. This risk index can also be applied to other contexts and countries to relax restrictions on particular low-risk routes while still restricting the high-risk ones. This would balance the essential air travels need and the requirement to minimize the imported case risk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd China; COVID-19; Imported case risk; International air travel  COVID-19 financial resources for physicians The appropriate focus in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been addressing access and delivery of care to the population affected by the outbreak. All sectors of the U.S. economy have been significantly affected, including physicians. Physician groups of all specialties and sizes have experienced the financial effects of the pandemic. Hospitals have received billions of dollars to support and enable them to manage emergencies and cover the costs of the disruption. However, many vascular surgeons are under great financial pressure because of the postponement of all nonemergency procedures. The federal government has announced a myriad of programs in the form of grants and loans to reimburse physicians for some of their expenses and loss of revenue. It is more than likely that unless the public health emergency subsides significantly, many practices will experience dire consequences without additional financial assistance. We have attempted to provide a concise listing of such programs and resources available to assist vascular surgeons who are small businesses in accessing these opportunities. © 2020 Society for Vascular Surgery Coronavirus Aid; Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act; COVID-19; Pandemic; Relief and Economic Security Act; Virus compensation; Coronavirus infection; economics; elective surgery; financial management; health service; hospital management; human; income; legislation and jurisprudence; management; pandemic; reimbursement; surgeon; United States; vascular surgery; virus pneumonia; Appointments and Schedules; Compensation and Redress; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Financing, Government; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Income; Insurance, Health, Reimbursement; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Policy Making; Surgeons; United States; Vascular Surgical Procedures COVID-19 energy sector responses in Africa: A review of preliminary government interventions The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed unprecedented shocks across all facets of society, from strained healthcare systems to the closure of schools and economies. The energy sector is of no exception, with several concerns being raised about the ramifications that will arise for the clean energy transition. The goal of our study is to review how governments in Africa have responded to this challenge in the energy sector. We used an internet search to gather information from government policy statements/briefs, and websites of international organizations such as the IMF, WHO, KPMG, and the World Bank. Our review revealed that the majority of preliminary responses were short-term and include the provision of free electricity, waiver/suspension of bill payments, and VAT exemptions on electricity bills. These measures were more pronounced in sub-Sahara Africa while oil-rich countries of the North mostly have broad economic measures that target their oil and gas sectors. Economic stimulus packages prepared by most countries do not explicitly mention energy sector companies/institutions, especially the Renewable Energies (RE) sector. Only three countries (Nigeria, Kenya, and Burkina Faso) had specific interventions for renewables. Overall, interventions were mostly fiscal/financial and short-term, with medium to long term measures often broad without being specific to the energy sector. As governments take measures to bolster their economies, they must pay particular attention to the challenges posed by the pandemic in the energy sector and capitalize on the opportunities that it presents to drive the clean energy transition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Africa; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Energy; Energy policy; Energy transition  Circular economy in Poland: Profitability analysis for two methods of waste processing in small municipalities The problem of diminishing resources on our plant is now getting due attention from the governments as well as scientists around the world. The transition from a linear economy to a circular economy (CE) is now among the top priorities. This article discusses the implementation of the circular economy paradigm in Poland through the analysis of the existing and planned mechanisms, and actions taken by the Polish government which can be replicated by other young European countries. Further, the article discusses the direction of change and projected measures planned by the Polish government to improve the quality of municipal solid waste management. In this context, profitability analysis is carried out for two methods of waste processing (incineration and torrefaction) intended for small municipalities and settlements in which district heating and trading of generated electricity are not feasible. The results of the analysis shows that torrefaction is clearly a more desirable waste processing option as a step towards the implementation of CE for civic society in the urban context, as well as profitability, in comparison to incineration. The analysis accounts for several scenarios before the lockdown caused due to the COVID-19 pandemic and after it was lifted. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The COVID-19 pandemic has struck the renewable energy manufacturing facilities, supply chains, and companies and slowed down the transition to the sustainable energy world. The global decline in economy-driven demand could damage the positive trend of green and low-carbon energy progress. Although it is too early to judge how profound the negative effects of the pandemic on the global renewable and sustainable energy systems will be, a significant short-run contraction to the development of renewables is inevitable. Therefore, the energy and climate policies may require to be restructured based on the new circumstances. In this context, several beneficial stimuluses should be offered by the governments to persuade the private sectors and society to invest on renewables. Undoubtedly, intelligent policies could convert the menaces of COVID-19 to the great opportunities for renewables and ultimately the world's sustainable energy scenario could return to its long-term trajectory toward green power generation and utilization over the next few years. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd   COVID-19: Adjustments for in the scientific research work in Mexico [COVID-19: Los reajustes en el trabajo de investigación científica en México] In the immediate future and the medium term, activities of Scientific and Technological Research, Human Resource Training, and Linkage and Social Appropriation of Knowledge will suffer the hardships of the new restrictions imposed by the new reality of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Societies, economies, Research and Higher Education Institutions that manage to adapt faster to these new challenges and have the structural capacities to make their processes flexible, will have a better chance to fastly overcome this global contingency. In Mexico, un-der the perspective of social transfer of knowledge, far from being a disruptive phenomenon, the evolution that this transfer has followed seems to find –from the confinement and impact of the COVID 19 pandemic–real possibilities of increasing interest for science topics and the opportunity of accessing them through the use of information technologies (ICTs). This is the case of actions for the social transfer of knowledge in a public research center, Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste, S.C. (CIBNOR), in which digital platforms have been consolidated to positively face the times. In this work, detailed, concrete and specific recom-mendations are provided so that the public institutions of research and Higher Education in Mexico can adapt to the new reality imposed by the pandemic as efficiently and functionally as possible in terms of scientific, humanistic and technological research, the training of human resources, and in the linkage and social appropriation of knowledge. © 2020 Terra Latinoamericana.

Although some exposed individuals have no symptoms and most symptomatic infections are not severe, COVID-19 cases span a wide spectrum, ranging from mild to critical and sometimes resulting in life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia, severe respiratory distress and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no curative drug for COVID-19 and vaccines are still under development. We are presenting here a strategy for the fast development of natural live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our proposed approach is based on screening for, identifying, analyzing and selecting naturally attenuated yet highly immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 strains, which may lead to a shorter cycle of vaccine development, as well as higher vaccine effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.

In November 2019, the Global Health Security (GHS) Index was released as the first detailed assessment and benchmarking of 195 countries to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. This paper presents the first comparison of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries' performance during the pandemic, with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic preparedness as determined by the GHS Index. Using a rank-based analysis, four indices were compared between select countries, including total cases, total deaths, recovery rate, and total tests performed, all standardized for comparison. Our findings suggest a discrepancy between the GHS index rating and the actual performance of countries during this pandemic, with an overestimation of the preparedness of some countries scoring highly on the GHS index and underestimation of the preparedness of other countries with relatively lower scores on the GHS index. © 2020 Abbey et al.

Spatial agglomeration of manufacturing in the Wuhan metropolitan area: An analysis of sectoral patterns and determinants The important role of the entity economy, especially manufacturing, has been further highlighted after the outbreak of COVID-19. This study fills a research gap on manufacturing in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area by analyzing the spatio-temporal evolution patterns and characteristics of manufacturing, exploring the major location factors causing spatial reconstruction and comparing the effect intensities of the different factors in the manufacturing sector. From 2003 to 2018, the process of industrial suburbanization in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area continued to strengthen and currently the overall spatial pattern of manufacturing in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area is characterized by spreading in metropolitan areas and aggregation in industrial parks. The results of a spatial metering model showed that the dominant factors affecting the layout of manufacturing included innovation and technical service platforms, industrial parks, the number of large enterprises, living convenience, and air quality. However, the effect intensity of the different location factors varied among industries. The findings may help the government to understand the characteristics of agglomeration and spreading in the manufacturing industry and, in accordance with the dominant factors affecting the location of this industry, rationally develop ideas for adjusting the industrial layout in the post-coronavirus age. © 2020 by the authors.

The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs. © Copyright © 2020 Beeraka, Sadhu, Madhunapantula, Rao Pragada, Svistunov, Nikolenko, Mikhaleva and Aliev.

It is indicated by the reputed organizations and medical fraternity that corona will stay here for a longer period contrary to the earlier assumptions. Hence the purpose of this study is to suggest a strategy which balances both preventive measures and economic losses to control the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: There is a need for the identification of the critical success factors (CSFs) for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies to control the pandemic with an economy-centric approach. Findings: The six CSFs identified are “Effective communication”, “Social distancing”, “Adopting new technology”, “Modify the rules and regulation at workplace”, “Sealing the borders of the territory” and “Strong leadership and government control”. Research limitations/implications: The study has a vital contribution to literature as no previous study has identified CSFs for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies while focusing on the economy. Practical implications: Further, these identified CSFs are helpful in medium and longer-term planning which is required to rebalance and re-energize the economy following this epidemic crisis. Originality/value: The study has given a model that depicts the cause and influence relationship between the key factors in the system under question. The importance of study increases many fold, as resources are limited and the outcome of the study could be used to channelize the resources effectively. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines against future pathogens. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Sartorius, D’Apice, Manco and De Berardinis. antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19; emerging infectious diseases; epidemics; pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; vaccines; viruses bacterial vaccine; CD47 antigen; DNA vaccine; hemagglutinin; hepatitis B surface antigen; live vaccine; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; subunit vaccine; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; inactivated vaccine; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody response; avian influenza (H5N1); cross reaction; cytokine production; dendritic cell; dengue; Dengue virus; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; gene expression; health care personnel; hepatitis E; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; innate immunity; Lassa fever; liver injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Review; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; SARS coronavirus; vaccination; virus infection; virus neutralization; virus particle; West Nile fever; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vaccines, DNA; Vaccines, Inactivated; Vaccines, Subunit; Viral Vaccines Coronavirus RNA Proofreading: Molecular Basis and Therapeutic Targeting The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is wreaking havoc on worldwide public health and economies has heightened awareness about the lack of effective antiviral treatments for human coronaviruses (CoVs). Many current antivirals, notably nucleoside analogs (NAs), exert their effect by incorporation into viral genomes and subsequent disruption of viral replication and fidelity. The development of anti-CoV drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to proofread and remove mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and transcription. Here, we review the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading complex and evaluate its potential as a drug target. We also consider existing nucleoside analogs and novel genomic techniques as potential anti-CoV therapeutics that could be used individually or in combination to target the proofreading mechanism. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Robson et al. examine the molecular basis of the coronavirus proofreading mechanism and how this contributes to the resistance of this family of viruses to nucleoside analog (NA) antiviral drugs. They discuss antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy in combination with NAs to potentially improve the potency and delivery of antiviral drugs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. anti-coronavirus drugs; antisense oligonucleotide; ASO; coronavirus; CoV; ExoN; exonuclease; NA; non-structural protein 14; nsp14; nucleoside analog anticoronavirus agent; beta d n4 hydroxycytidine; cytidine derivative; exonuclease; favipiravir; methyltransferase; nsp10 protein; nsp12 protein; nsp7 protein; nsp8 protein; nucleoside analog; remdesivir; sofosbuvir; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus RNA; adenosine phosphate; alanine; amide; antivirus agent; EIDD-2801; favipiravir; pyrazine derivative; remdesivir; ribonucleoside; viral protein; virus RNA; Coronaviridae; death domain superfamily; drug repositioning; drug targeting; exon; gene replication; genetic transcription; human; molecular biology; nonhuman; protein domain; protein protein interaction; Review; RNA capping; virus genome; virus replication; zinc finger motif; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; mutation; pandemic; pathogenicity; procedures; severity of illness index; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Amides; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Genome, Viral; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pyrazines; Ribonucleosides; RNA, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; Transcription, Genetic; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Virus Replication Stock market reactions to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak: Quantitative evidence from ARDL bounds tests and granger causality analysis This paper examines the linkages in financial markets during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak. For this purpose, daily stock market returns were used over the period of December 31, 2019–April 20, 2020 for the following economies: USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, China, and Romania. The study applied the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to explore whether the Romanian stock market is impacted by the crisis generated by novel coronavirus. Granger causality was employed to investigate the causalities among COVID-19 and stock market returns, as well as between pandemic measures and several commodities. The outcomes of the ARDL approach failed to find evidence towards the impact of Chinese COVID-19 records on the Romanian financial market, neither in the short-term, nor in the long-term. On the other hand, our quantitative approach reveals a negative effect of the new deaths’ cases from Italy on the 10-year Romanian bond yield both in the short-run and long-run. The econometric research provide evidence that Romanian 10-year government bond is more sensitive to the news related to COVID-19 than the index of the Bucharest Stock Exchange. Granger causality analysis reveals causal associations between selected stock market returns and Philadelphia Gold/Silver Index. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Functions of the dependence on the number of the infected populations in Eastern Europe on pandemic duration were calculated based on trend analysis. Factors affecting the intensity of disease and the number of infected persons have been determined. Integral model of their influence has been built using regression analysis. Based on the values of the factors, the number of infected people and the rate of infection were predicted for each of the Eastern European countries. The prognostic duration of the stage of exponential disease growth and the total duration of quarantine (epidemiological saturation point) are substantiated. The predicted decline in Eastern European GDP due to COVID-19 has been estimated based on the construction of a prognostic regression model. The results obtained can be used by state authorities and economic agents as a tool for active and preventive response. They can also serve as an example of the urgent need to develop, especially in non-standard situations, mechanisms and products of open innovation. © 2020 by the authors.

Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases. © 2020 The Author Coronavirus; Economy; Health; Lockdown; Model; Norms Article; child development; clinical outcome; coronavirus disease 2019; economic development; economic recession; education; employment; endowment effect; gross national product; health care personnel; health promotion; hospital bed capacity; human; mathematical model; pandemic; population size; priority journal; public health; quarantine; risk; social determinants of health; social support; virus transmission The first two months epidimiological study of COVID-19, related public health preparedness, and response to the ongoing epidemic in Pakistan As an underdeveloped country, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has posed a major risk to the health and economy of Pakistan. The SIR (susceptible–infected–recovered) model of epidemiologic analysis predicts that there should have been more cases since late March 2020 in Pakistan. We therefore sought to investigate COVID-19's prevalence and epidemiologic trends in Pakistan. Research for COVID-19 is still in its early stages, so data were collected from official websites and research journals, then analyzed for the disease's prevalence, epidemiology, mortality and recoveries. The results indicated that a rapid increase had indeed occurred in the number of COVID-19 infections in Pakistan, with the first case reported on 25 February, 2020. From 25 February 25 to April, 2020, COVID-19 infected 11,155 people in Pakistan, with 237 deaths (2.12%) and 2527 recoveries (19.96%). We found a statistically significant positive correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 and the mortality ratio (r = 0.983, r2 = 0.966; p ≤ 0.05). We concluded that proper management must be undertaken to improve the quarantine system, and the World Health Organization guidelines must be closely followed to cope with COVID-19. There is no vaccine for COVID-19, so antiviral drugs (interferon alfa, ribavirin) may be useful to prevent COVID-19; however, severe control measures implemented in China have significantly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Suspected and confirmed cases must be treated in separate rooms. Staying home and social distancing are the safe way to proceed. © 2020 Comparison; COVID-19; Current outbreak; Epidemiology; Prevention alpha interferon; ribavirin; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemic; human; mortality rate; Pakistan; pandemic; practice guideline; prevalence; priority journal; public health; social distancing Lower Incidence of COVID-19 at High Altitude: Facts and Confounders Pun, Matiram, Rachel Turner, Giacomo Strapazzon, Hermann Brugger, and Erik R. Swenson. Lower incidence of COVID-19 at high altitude: Facts and confounders. High Alt Med Biol. 21:217-222, 2020. - The rapid transmission, increased morbidity, and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exhausted many health care systems and the global economy. Large variations in COVID-19 prevalence and incidence have been reported across and within many countries worldwide; however, this remains poorly understood. The variability and susceptibility across the world have been mainly attributed to differing socioeconomic status, burden of chronic diseases, access to health care, strength of health care systems, and early or late adoption of control measures. Environmental factors such as pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns at different latitudes may influence how severe the pandemic is and the incidence of infection in any part of the world. In addition, recent epidemiological data have been used to propose that altitude of residence may not only influence those environmental features considered key to lesser viral transmission, but also susceptibility to more severe forms of COVID-19 through hypoxic-hypobaria driven genomic or nongenomic adaptations specific to high-altitude populations. In this review, we critically examine these factors and attempt to determine based upon available scientific and epidemiological data whether living in high-altitude regions might be protective against COVID-19 as recent publications have claimed. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

In Hong Kong, where tourism is a pillar industry, the hotel industry is essential to maintaining a stable economy. Facing multiple forms of pressure, the industry's status deserves close attention. More than 200 hotels in Hong Kong were taken as the research set in this study. A Python-based web crawler was used to collect daily hotel prices from various online travel agencies. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis, and descriptive analysis were employed to study hotels' room rate fluctuations over time. Results indicated that room rates across hotels in Hong Kong were primarily influenced by holidays and festivities prior to COVID-19, whereas rates tended to decline after the outbreak. Data analysis based on hotels' star ratings revealed that 5-star hotels were relatively less affected by COVID-19 while 4- and 4.5-star hotels were most seriously affected. District-level analysis also showed that hotel room rates were differentially influenced by the virus: Hong Kong's Islands district was hit hardest, followed by Kowloon. These findings offer valuable implications for hotel managers and relevant government departments in making rational decisions based on the current market state. © 2020 by the authors.

There is much pressure to develop both preventative and curative therapies for SARS-CoV-2 as there is no evidence to support therapies to improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Medications that inhibit certain steps of virus life cycle that are currently used to treat other illnesses such as Malaria, Ebola, HIV and Hepatitis C are being studied for use against SARS-CoV-2. To date, data is limited for medications that facilitate clinical improvement of COVID-19 infections. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 2019-nCoV; acetazolamide; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); autoimmune; camostat mesylate; chloroquine; COVID-19; high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE); hydroxychloroquine; Lopinavir/Ritonavir; novel coronavirus 2019; pandemic; Remdesivir; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors; SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV); SARS CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Umifenovir adenosine phosphate; alanine; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; camostat; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; gabexate; hydroxychloroquine; indole derivative; lopinavir; lopinavir-ritonavir drug combination; monoclonal antibody; remdesivir; ritonavir; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; tocilizumab; umifenovir; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; drug combination; drug effect; drug repositioning; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; immunology; pandemic; pathogenicity; virology; virus pneumonia; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Drug Combinations; Drug Repositioning; Gabexate; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Indoles; Lopinavir; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Ritonavir; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus Covid-19: Mechanisms of vaccination and immunity Vaccines are needed to protect from SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. Vaccines that induce large quantities of high affinity virus-neutralizing antibodies may optimally prevent infection and avoid unfavorable effects. Vaccination trials require precise clinical management, complemented with detailed evaluation of safety and immune responses. Here, we review the pros and cons of available vaccine platforms and options to accelerate vaccine development towards the safe immunization of the world’s population against SARS-CoV-2. Favorable vaccines, used in well-designed vaccination strategies, may be critical for limiting harm and promoting trust and a long-term return to normal public life and economy. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is being used widely to detect COVID-19 from various types of biological specimens, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and may not be rapidly deployable in remote or resource-limited settings. This might lead to hindrance in acquiring realistic data of infectivity and community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. This review summarizes the existing status of current diagnostic methods, their possible limitations, and the advantages of biosensor-based diagnostics over the conventional ones for the detection of SARS-Cov-2. Novel biosensors used to detect RNA-viruses include CRISPR-Cas9 based paper strip, nucleic-acid based, aptamer-based, antigen-Au/Ag nanoparticles-based electrochemical biosensor, optical biosensor, and Surface Plasmon Resonance. These could be effective tools for rapid, authentic, portable, and more promising diagnosis in the current pandemic that has affected the world economies and humanity. Present challenges and future perspectives of developing robust biosensors devices for rapid, scalable, and sensitive detection and management of COVID-19 are presented in light of the test-test-test theme of the World Health Organization (WHO). © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

Our results, using both GARCH (1,1) and VAR specifications, suggest that such events are directly affecting the dry bulk and the dirty tanker segments. In addition, the results also suggest that second round effects, mostly via the decline in oil prices and, in some cases, third round effects via the impact from the stock market, also exist. Finally, by employing daily port calls a proxy variable for the demand for transportation services, we show that both the dry bulk and clean tankers are highly affected by the demand side of the economy, while vessels which transport crude oil do not register such a relationship. © 2020 The Authors Covid-19; Freight rates; Shipping markets  Air quality implications of COVID-19 in California The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected human health and the economy. The implementation of social distancing practices to combat the virus spread, however, has led to a notable improvement in air quality. This study compared the surface air quality monitoring data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)'s AirNow network during the period 20 March-5 May in 2020 to those in 2015-2019 from the Air Quality System (AQS) network over the state of California. The results indicated changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of-2.04 ± 1.57 μg m-3 and ozone of-3.07 ± 2.86 ppb. If the air quality improvements persist over a year, it could potentially lead to 3970-8900 prevented premature deaths annually (note: the estimates of prevented premature deaths have large uncertainties). Public transit demand showed dramatic declines (~80%). The pandemic provides an opportunity to exhibit how substantially human behavior could impact on air quality. To address both the pandemic and climate change issues, better strategies are needed to affect behavior, such as ensuring safer shared mobility, the higher adoption of telecommuting, automation in the freight sector, and cleaner energy transition. © 2020 by the authors.

Originating in China in late 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak spread across the entire world in a matter of three to four months. This volume examines the first responses to the pandemic, the contexts of earlier epidemics and the epidemiological basics of infectious diseases. Further, it discusses patterns in the spread of the disease; the management and containment of infections at the personal, national and global level; effects on trade and commerce; the social and psychological impact on people the disruption and postponement of international events; the role of various international organizations like the WHO in the search for solutions; and the race for a vaccine or a cure. Authored by a medical professional and an economist working on the frontlines, this book gives a nuanced, verified and fact-checked analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic and its global response. A one-stop resource on the COVID-19 outbreak, it is indispensable for every reader and a holistic work for scholars and researchers of medical sociology, public health, political economy, public policy and governance, sociology of health and medicine, and paramedical and medical practitioners. It will also be a great resource for policymakers, government departments and civil society organizations working in the area. © 2021 Tapas Kumar Koley and Monika Dhole.   The impact of COVID-19 on franchising in emerging markets: An example from Brazil The outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had significant economic, political, and social consequences worldwide. The franchising sector, consisting mostly of retail and service businesses, is an example of an industry that has been deeply affected. The experiences of franchising stakeholders in Brazil highlight the strengths of the franchising model in such situations. This investigation, based on primary data from webinars with food service, education, retail, and business-to-business service companies in Brazil, coupled with reports from commercial and franchising entities, reveals how the COVID-19 outbreak has affected the franchising sector. It illustrates the measures that were taken, the negotiations that take place between suppliers and landlords, the adaptation of business models, the effects on franchisor-franchisee relationships, and the impact the pandemic has had on relationships with customers. The strategies adopted by Brazilian franchisors and franchisees suggest lessons for other franchising companies in similar situations, such as those in developing and emerging economies. © 2020 The Authors.

A property oriented pandemic surviving trading model The COVID-19 pandemic produced adverse effects on the global economy. The devastating impact of COVID-19 or coronavirus on the prices of commodities such as oil and gas as well as foreign exchange (Forex) trading systems and currency pairs across the nations, resulted in the collapse of businesses and shutdown of the economy. It was also accompanied with great loss of fund for investors in stock and Forex due to the consequent failure of some stock and forex software systems and strategies which were designed without envisaging the great volatility of market prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This study focuses on the examination and analysis of the performance of some Forex systems in the period of the pandemic. It identifies failed and successful systems during the period of the pandemic and proposes a pandemic surviving trading model to address the problem of the effect of unforeseen disaster such as the pandemic on trading systems. The systems examines the properties and data of failed and successful systems and integrates the best properties in the proposed model to provide a model which is likely to survive any possible future pandemic. The results show that systems developed with the property oriented pandemic surviving trading model produced a significant increase in profit during the pandemic compared to the existing system. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

Approximately 19.3 million people have now been infected and over 700,000 have died. This global public health crisis has since cascaded into a series of challenges for leaders around the world, threatening both the health and economy of populations. This paper attempts to compartmentalise leadership aspects, allowing a closer examination of published reports and the analysis of current outcomes, thus enabling the authors to formulate a number of evidence-based recommendations on the de-escalation of restrictions. © 2020 COVID-19; Healthcare policy; Leadership; Management; Novel coronavirus coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; emergency care; evidence based practice; health care policy; hospital admission; human; interpersonal communication; leadership; medical specialist; morbidity; mortality rate; pandemic; patient monitoring; population; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment planning; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; public health; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Policy; Humans; Leadership; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health Challenges of COVID-19 in children in low- and middle-income countries As the coronavirus pandemic extends to low and middle income countries (LMICs), there are growing concerns about the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in populations with high prevalence of comorbidities, the impact on health and economies more broadly and the capacity of existing health systems to manage the additional burden of COVID-19. The direct effects of COVID are less of a concern in children, who seem to be largely asymptomatic or to develop mild illness as occurs in high income countries; however children in LMICs constitute a high proportion of the population and may have a high prevalence of risk factors for severe lower respiratory infection such as HIV or malnutrition. Further diversion of resources from child health to address the pandemic among adults may further impact on care for children. Poor living conditions in LMICs including lack of sanitation, running water and overcrowding may facilitate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The indirect effects of the pandemic on child health are of considerable concern, including increasing poverty levels, disrupted schooling, lack of access to school feeding schemes, reduced access to health facilities and interruptions in vaccination and other child health programs. Further challenges in LMICs include the inability to implement effective public health measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene, timely identification of infected people with self-isolation and universal use of masks. Lack of adequate personal protective equipment, especially N95 masks is a key concern for health care worker protection. While continued schooling is crucial for children in LMICs, provision of safe environments is especially challenging in overcrowded resource constrained schools. The current crisis is a harsh reminder of the global inequity in health in LMICs. The pandemic highlights key challenges to the provision of health in LMICs, but also provides opportunities to strengthen child health broadly in such settings. © 2020 Child; COVID; Indirect effects; Low-middle income countries; Resource allocation child health; community living; coronavirus disease 2019; crowding (area); disease course; disease transmission; hand washing; health care access; health care facility; health care personnel; health program; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; low income country; malnutrition; middle income country; nonhuman; poverty; prevalence; priority journal; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk factor; sanitation; school; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; social isolation; treatment interruption; vaccination; Betacoronavirus; child; child health; Coronavirus infection; developing country; education; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; malnutrition; pandemic; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; water supply; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child Health; Coronavirus Infections; Crowding; Developing Countries; Education; HIV Infections; Humans; Malnutrition; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Poverty; Risk Factors; Sanitation; Water Supply Vaccine development against coronavirus (2003 to present): An overview, recent advances, current scenario, opportunities and challenges Background and aim: The pandemic COVID-19 occurring due to novel emerging coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is severely affecting the worldwide public health, culture, economy and human social behaviour. Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine. Method: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine.

With the worldwide adverse socio-economic effects of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), such application now becomes timely. Therefore, relying on a Random Utility theoretic formulation of youths' preferences for the biosphere (ecosystem services, sustainability) and science-based disease prevention to characterize their planetary health interests, this paper adopts a micro-based planetary view of markets to retrospectively analyze the health and ecological implications of digital media consumption among youths in the global economy. Empirically, we rely on a mixed bivariate ordered probit specification, which is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Our findings reveal a strong, positive correlation coefficient (0.835) between youths' interests in the biosphere and science-based disease prevention. Moreover, digital media consumption in the form of increased frequency of ecological website visits, news blogs visits, and web-browsing on broad science, significantly reduce youths' interests in the biosphere. A similar reduction in youths' interest in science-based disease prevention is observed, from news blogs visits and web-browsing on broad science. Conversely, ecological website visits appear to raise youths' interests in science-based disease prevention. Furthermore, we find a gender-based gradient in youths' planetary health interest, in favor of the female gender. Overall, our findings confirm the appropriateness of a holistic view of health, and suggests a couple of policy implications for the long-term sustainability of our planet. © 2020 by the authors.

Infectious diseases account for more than 20% of global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths. Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, however there have been previous outbreaks of different versions of the beta coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV1) from 2002 to 2003 and the most recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. All of the above have been recognised as major pathogens that are a great threat to public health and global economies. Currently, no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified; however, certain drugs have shown apparent efficacy in viral inhibition of the disease. Natural substances such as herbs and mushrooms have previously demonstrated both great antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, the possibilities of natural substances as effective treatments against COVID-19 may seem promising. One of the potential candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be Inonotus obliquus (IO), also known as chaga mushroom. IO commonly grows in Asia, Europe and North America and is widely used as a raw material in various medical conditions. In this review, we have evaluated the most effective herbs and mushrooms, in terms of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects which have been assessed in laboratory conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

To date, there is no specific medicine or vaccine available against this pandemic disease. However, the presence of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules with antiviral properties might also be a successful strategy in order to develop therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this review will summarize the available literature and other information/data sources related to antiviral medicinal plants, with possible ethnobotanical evidence in correlation with coronaviruses. The identification of novel antiviral compounds is of critical significance, and medicinal plant based natural compounds are a good source for such discoveries. In depth search and analysis revealed several medicinal plants with excellent efficacy against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which are well-known to act on ACE-2 receptor, 3CLpro and other viral protein targets. In this review, we have consolidated the data of several medicinal plants and their natural bioactive metabolites, which have promising antiviral activities against coronaviruses with detailed modes of action/mechanism. It is concluded that this review will be useful for researchers worldwide and highly recommended for the development of naturally safe and effective therapeutic drugs/agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be used in therapeutic protocols alone or in combination with chemically synthetized drugs. © 2020, MDPI AG.

From this perspective, plasmonic-based biosensing can manage the threat of infectious diseases by providing timely virus monitoring. In recent years, many plasmonics’ platforms have embraced the challenge of offering on-site strategies to complement traditional diagnostic methods relying on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This review compiled recent progress on the development of novel plasmonic sensing schemes for the effective control of virus-related diseases. A special focus was set on the utilization of plasmonic nanostructures in combination with other detection formats involving colorimetric, fluorescence, luminescence, or Raman scattering enhancement. The quantification of different viruses (e.g., hepatitis virus, influenza virus, norovirus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus) with particular attention to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reviewed from the perspective of the biomarker and the biological receptor immobilized on the sensor chip. Technological limitations including selectivity, stability, and monitoring in biological matrices were also reviewed for different plasmonic-sensing approaches. © 2020 by the author.

The consequences from the pandemic are devastating, not only for human health and the national health systems throughout the world, but also for the global economy. Bats, pangolins, muskrats and other wild animals have been implicated as possible hosts of the virus. According to recent research data, the increased concentration of particulate air matter in the atmosphere appears to have contributed significantly to the spread (airborne transmission) and aggressiveness of the disease, as large cities with high levels of air pollution showed the highest numbers of SARS-CoV2 cases and deaths. It also appears that the collapse of natural ecosystems resulting from the ever-evolving climate change has been crucial for the migration of animals to new areas and their interaction with other animals that they would not normally encounter, resulting in the emergence of new pathogens, which in turn infected humans. It is now clear that the era of “climate medicine” which will be a cornerstone for the practice of medicine in the 21st century, has already begun. © Athens Medical Society.

Based upon current researches, this virus is spreading from one human to another through respiratory droplets, i.e. cough and sneeze. Till now, there has not been any specific treatment found for this virus. Hence, there is a critical need to discover alternative techniques to cope with the current scenario. Recent Findings: This review conducted an online search for prevention of coronavirus infection with the help of nutritional interventions. It has been observed that the effect of the virus is mostly on the individual with low immunity, individual affected with diseases like diabetes, and individual using any immune-suppressed drug or having past history of major surgeries or severe medical conditions. Summary: Therefore, consuming foods which boost immunity helps in preventing respiratory-related disorder or suppressing diseases-related problems, which could be helpful in controlling the spread of this virus. In conclusion, it has been suggested that before the beginning of generalised treatments and interventions in each infected patient, nutritional status should be evaluated, as it can help in creating a specific nutrition intervention for the infected individual. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Now in the 21st century in the post‐antibiotic era, the miracle is turning into a nightmare, due to the growing problem of the resistance of microorganisms to classic antimicrobials and the non‐investment by the pharmaceutical industry in new antimicrobial agents. Unfortunately, the current COVID‐19 pandemic has demonstrated the global risks associated with uncontrolled infections and the various forms of impact that such a pandemic may have on the economy and on social habits besides the associated morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to recycle classic antibiotics, as is the case in the use of ionic liquids (ILs) based on antibiotics. Thus, the aim of the present review is to summarize the data on ILs, mainly those with antimicrobial action and especially against resistant strains. The main conclusions of this article are that ILs are flexible due to their ability to modulate cations and anions as a salt, making it possible to combine the properties of both and multiplying the activity of separate cations and anions. Also, these compounds have low cost methods of production, which makes it highly attractive to explore them, especially as antimicrobial agents and against resistant strains. ILs may further be combined with other therapeutic strategies, such as phage or lysine therapy, enhancing the therapeutic arsenal needed to fight this worldwide problem of antibacterial resistance. Thus, the use of ILs as antibiotics by themselves or together with phage therapy and lysine therapy are promising alternatives against pathogenic microorganisms, and may have the possibility to be used in new ways in order to restrain uncontrolled infections. © 2020 by the authors.

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, is even more devastating in terms of patient mortality. At the time of this writing, the nanoscopic SARS-Cov-2 virus has paralyzed the world economy and resulted in what are likely permanent changes in our expectations of society and daily life. New technology is needed to reduce the economic and social impacts of diseases such as COVID-19 and prevent additional negative consequences resulting from subsequent pandemics. As viruses such as Influenza A and SARS-Cov-2 are transmitted from person to person by exposure to infected secretions, inexpensive at-home or workplace tests for the analysis of the virus content within those secretions, such as saliva or mucus from the nasopharynx (as in a swab-based test) or oropharynx (as in a saliva-based test), will be critical for a safe return to work, school, and cultural activities. The most reliable approaches for viral sensing are polymerase chain reaction and protein detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; however, these approaches require extensive sample handling, laboratory infrastructure, and long sample-to-result time. Advances are leading to increased point-of-care capability for these testing methods, but even this effort is insufficient for curbing the impact of the current pandemic. There are many options for alternative virus (or antigen) detection currently in development. These novel approaches are more amenable for testing in home or workplace without specialized equipment and training and include measurements of mass changes, heat of adsorption, electrochemical changes, changes in optical properties, and changes in electronic properties. Of these transduction mechanisms, electronic property measurements of materials as they interact with virus-containing secretions offer the greatest potential for simplicity, selectivity, and sensitivity needed to revolutionize traditional laboratory assays for at-home pathogen detection. We have, therefore, focused this review on the operation and architecture of electronic antigen sensors, specifically those demonstrating a change in electrical conductivity when interacting with a specific antigen, with hopes that a brief summary of over five decades of research in this area will be beneficial to those developing alternative, user-friendly routes for detection of viruses at this or any time. A key element in electronic virus sensing with useful sensitivity is the use of nanomaterials with ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratios, maximizing the change in charge carrier density upon adsorption events. So-called ""low-dimensional materials""are materials characterized by nanoscopic length scales in at least one dimension. One-dimensional nanomaterials such as nanowires and nanotubes are well-established as effective sensing materials with potential for high sensitivity; however, their realization on a large scale has been challenging. Two-dimensional materials are planar materials with thicknesses of one or a few molecular layers and represent the ultimate limit of the surface-to-volume ratio with promising demonstrations of large-scale production and sensitive, selective virus sensing with many options for functionalization. All aspects of 2D sensor fabrication, functionalization, and use are addressed. © 2020 Author(s).

The discovery and development of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies could be one approach to treat or prevent infection by this coronavirus. Here we report the isolation of sixty-one SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to hospital with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Among these are nineteen antibodies that potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, nine of which exhibited very high potency, with 50% virus-inhibitory concentrations of 0.7 to 9 ng ml−1. Epitope mapping showed that this collection of nineteen antibodies was about equally divided between those directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and those directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD), indicating that both of these regions at the top of the viral spike are immunogenic. In addition, two other powerful neutralizing antibodies recognized quaternary epitopes that overlap with the domains at the top of the spike. Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of one antibody that targets the RBD, a second that targets the NTD, and a third that bridges two separate RBDs showed that the antibodies recognize the closed, ‘all RBD-down’ conformation of the spike. Several of these monoclonal antibodies are promising candidates for clinical development as potential therapeutic and/or prophylactic agents against SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.  neutralizing antibody; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; epitope; immunoglobulin F(ab) fragment; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; antibody; concentration (composition); global economy; inhibition; reconstruction; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virus; amino terminal sequence; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cryoelectron microscopy; hospital admission; human; immunogenicity; in vitro study; inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; priority journal; protein conformation; protein domain; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus isolation; virus spike; animal; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; disease model; epitope mapping; female; immunology; lung; male; Mesocricetus; molecular model; pandemic; pathology; serodiagnosis; ultrastructure; virology; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Disease Models, Animal; Epitope Mapping; Epitopes, B-Lymphocyte; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments; Lung; Male; Mesocricetus; Models, Molecular; Neutralization Tests; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus Daily Monitoring of Emotional Responses to the Coronavirus Pandemic in Serbia: A Citizen Science Approach The COVID-19 pandemic, a health emergency with international consequences, has brought serious impact on all aspects of society and affects not only health and economy, but psychological functioning and mental health as well. This research was conducted in order to examine and further our understanding of emotional reactions to the ongoing pandemic. Change in emotional reactions during the pandemic and relations with specific pandemic related behaviors and personality traits from the revised Reinforcement sensitivity theory were explored. The research was conducted in Serbia for 35 days while the country was in a state of emergency, as a citizen science project. Out of the 1526 participants that joined the study, 444 (67% female) had measures for all five weeks. Longitudinal changes in four emotional states during the pandemic were examined: worry, fear, boredom, and anger/annoyance. Results indicate a decrease in all four emotional states over time. The biggest decrease was present in case of worry, followed by fear and boredom. Regression analysis showed that personality dimensions, as well as behavioral responses in this situation significantly predicted emotional reactions. Findings revealed the Behavioral activation system was significantly related to worry, fear and boredom, Fight with boredom and anger, and the Behavioral inhibition system with anger. Adherence to protection measures, as well as increased exposure to the media, had significant positive relations with worry and fear. These results indicate that both stable characteristics and specific pandemic-related behaviors are significantly related to emotional response during the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Sadiković, Branovački, Oljača, Mitrović, Pajić and Smederevac. citizen science; COVID-19; emotional reactions; RRST; the state of emergency  Household Financial Decision Making Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic This paper investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household investment decisions using a novel survey conducted by the Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance. We use linear probability and probit models to analyze the effects of COVID-19 at the household level. Our results show that households who know someone infected with COVID-19 lose confidence in the economy. They are more likely to change their risk behavior and become risk-averse. Further, COVID-19 increases the probability that a household will change its investment portfolio. More specifically, it causes a 9.15% decrease in the total investment amount. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. coronavirus; COVID-19; Financial decision making; pandemic; risk behavior  Implications of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Global Trade Networks This article measures the trade interconnectedness among countries before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and forecasts the future direction of trade. Using Trade Network Analysis and Artificial Neural Networks, our findings show that: (1) There is a drastic reduction in trade interconnectedness, connectivity, and density among countries after the COVID-19 outbreak. (2) There is a visible change in the structure of trade-network (3) China’s ‘center’ position in the trade network is not affected by the pandemic.

We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian financial market and compare it with the outcomes of two recent structural changes of the Indian economy: demonetization and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Using daily stock return, net foreign institutional investment, and exchange rate data from January 3, 2003 to April 20, 2020, we find negative stock returns for all the indices during the COVID-19 outbreak, unlike during the post-demonetization and GST phases. Markov switching vector autoregression shows the impact of COVID-19 on stock returns is severe in comparison to that of demonetization and the GST. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Using a sample of 23 emerging markets across three regions, our findings suggest that decreasing (increasing) trend in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases is associated with improving (deteriorating) liquidity in financial markets. We also find that policy interventions in terms of restrictions on movement and businesses are associated with improved liquidity.

Each country has a different response method, and the damage scale is also distinct. This study aims to find out how COVID-19-related news was handled in the domestic media to seek ways to minimize the pandemic. The paper focuses on the number of news features by period and by disaster and analyzes related words based on big data. The results of the analysis are as follows. First, in the initial response phase, keywords to identify accurate sources of actual broadcast contents, fake news, social networking service (SNS), etc. were also ranked in the top 20. Second, in the active response phase, when the number of confirmed persons and the government’s countermeasures were announced, more than 100 COVID-19-related articles were issued, and the related words increased rapidly from the initial response stage. Therefore, the fact that COVID-19 has been expressed as a keyword indicates that our society is watching with great interest in the government’s response to the disease. © 2020 by the authors.

This disease has hugely affected healthcare systems as well as the economy to an extent never seen before. To date, COVID-19 infection has led to about 165000 deaths in 150 countries. At present, there is no specific drug or efficient treatment for this disease. In this analysis based on evidential relationships of the biological characteristics of MSCs, especially umbilical cord (UC)-derived MSCs as well as the first clinical trial using MSCs for COVID-19 treatment, we discuss the use of UC-MSCs to improve the symptoms of COVID-19 in patients. ©The Author(s) 2020.

This disease makes some problems in the health system, society, politics, and economy. Several reports showed that mortality in COVID-19 patients was related to abnormal kidney function. This condition should be considered to prevent death. Some investigational drugs are on the way in the preclinical and clinical trials. Some of them no have a study for safety in the kidney especially in chronic kidney disease patients including those who undergo hemodialysis. Some give a satisfying effect. Understanding COVID-19, kidney diseases, and drugs will help us to get the most potent treatment. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.

Yet, few have provided a synthesis that examines how these factors relate to each other. This article fills this gap in the debate by comparing COVID-19 responses among five advanced economies in East Asia: Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan. Although agile actions and competence of top leadership are necessary to confront an unprecedented crisis, they are by themselves insufficient. Equally critical is whether a society has the necessary institutional infrastructure in place when a crisis strikes. Policy instruments are more likely to succeed when existing institutional infrastructure supports their administration and implementation. For an instrument to generate enduring impact, it must be compatible with a polity’s underlying culture; instruments that accommodate the underlying cultural orientations are more likely to elicit public cooperation and voluntary compliance over time. Policy instruments must also address equity issues by reaching marginalized groups across all layers of the population. Progress in emergency management may be visible in mainstream society but masking brewing problems among marginalized groups. A comparison across the five advanced economies in East Asia yields several implications for comparative research and policy. © The Author(s) 2020.

Most countries are enforcing strict quarantine to control the havoc of this highly contagious disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many data analyses have been done to provide close support to decision-makers. We propose a method comprising data analytics and machine learning classification for evaluating the effectiveness of lockdown regulations. Lockdown regulations should be reviewed on a regular basis by governments, to enable reasonable control over the outbreak. The model aims to measure the efficiency of lockdown procedures for various countries. The model shows a direct correlation between lockdown procedures and the infection rate. Lockdown efficiency is measured by finding a correlation coefficient between lockdown attributes and the infection rate. The lockdown attributes include retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, residential, and schools. Our results show that combining all the independent attributes in our study resulted in a higher correlation (0.68) to the dependent value Interquartile 3 (Q3).

Effects on psychology, environment and economy-perspective COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on unconstrained (r = −0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob > .0203 with 49 observations) and based on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown. The application of lockdown by governments is also thought to be effective on psychology, environment and economy besides having impact on Covid-19. © 2020 The Author Correlation; COVID-19; Economy; Environment; Lockdown; Psychology air quality; Article; carbon footprint; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; cumulative scale; descriptive research; economic aspect; economic evaluation; environment; environmental factor; food intake; human; infection prevention; major clinical study; mental disease; mental health; mortality rate; pandemic; priority journal; psychology; quarantine; remote sensing; social behavior; social isolation; social status; statistical analysis; time series analysis; water quality Newly emerging human coronaviruses: Animal models and vaccine research for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 The recent emergence of the novel coronavirus (CoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global threat to human health and economy. As of June 26, 2020, over 9.4 million cases of infection, including 482,730 deaths, had been confirmed across 216 countries. To combat a devastating virus pandemic, numerous studies on vaccine development are urgently being accelerated. In this review article, we take a brief look at the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoVs and discuss recent approaches to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development. © 2020.

As the world is struggling to minimize the transmission of this devastating disease, several strategies are being actively deployed to develop therapeutic interventions. Pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers are relentlessly working to investigate experimental, repurposed or FDA-approved drugs on a compassionate basis and novel biologics for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and treatment. Presently, a tremendous surge of COVID-19 clinical trials are advancing through different stages. Among currently registered clinical efforts, ~86% are centered on testing small molecules or antibodies either alone or in combination with immunomodulators. The rest ~14% of clinical efforts are aimed at evaluating vaccines and convalescent plasma-based therapies to mitigate the disease's symptoms. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic modalities being evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Recently, concerns have been raised about possible association between ethnicity, incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 arisen from early government data. In this review, we will explore the possible association using both recent COVID-19 studies and studies of previous pandemics. We call for data on ethnicity to be routinely collected by governments, as part of an international collaboration, alongside other patient demographics and further research to robustly determine the magnitude of association. Moreover, governments must learn from previous pandemics and recommended strategies to mitigate risks on minority ethnicities due to socioeconomic disadvantages. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.  vitamin D; ACE2 gene; adaptive immunity; Asian; attitude to health; BCG vaccination; Black person; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; cellular immunity; coronary artery disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cultural factor; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease predisposition; disease severity; ethnic group; gene; genetic polymorphism; genetic predisposition; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; government; health care policy; high risk population; human; hypertension; incidence; innate immunity; kidney disease; lifestyle; lung function; oxidative stress; pandemic; public health; quantitative trait locus; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; social status; socioeconomics; vitamin blood level; vitamin D deficiency; Asian continental ancestry group; Betacoronavirus; Black person; Coronavirus infection; ethnic group; ethnology; health care disparity; incidence; international cooperation; isolation and purification; minority health; organization and management; pandemic; virus pneumonia; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Ethnic Groups; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Incidence; International Cooperation; Minority Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors Mask or no mask for COVID-19: A public health and market study Efficient strategies to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are peremptory to relieve the negatively impacted public health and global economy, with the full scope yet to unfold. In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies. © 2020 Li et al.

Disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19 will change the world in many ways and the road to redemption from the ongoing economic distress may require a novel approach. This paper proposes a path towards economic recovery that keeps sustainability at the forefront. A computable general equilibrium model is used to simulate different green tax reform (GTR) policies for triple dividend (TD), consisting of lower emissions, higher GDP and higher employment. The GTR design consists of an energy tax coupled with one of three tax revenue recycle methods: (i) reduction of payroll tax, (ii) reduction of goods and services tax (GST) and (iii) a mixed-recycling approach. The paper also presents the impact of higher productivity on the tax reform simulations, which is a possible positive externality of lower emissions. The study is based on the Australian economy and the salient findings are twofold: (i) productivity gain in the GTR context improves the GDP and employment outcomes in all three different simulation scenarios and (ii) GST reduction has the highest TD potential, followed by reduction of payroll tax. © 2020 by the authors.

At present, the development of supply chain finance is facing an important point: The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has a wide impact on the global economy, which not only generates the strong demand for supply chain finance, but also brings new uncertainty. At the same time, the accelerated development of Fintech provides more possibilities and tools for supply chain finance model innovation and risk management. This paper summarizes the current situation of supply chain finance from two aspects of practical development and theoretical research, and analyzes its future development trend. First of all, the practical development of supply chain finance is sorted out and divided into four stages for analysis. Secondly, with the help of bibliometrics tools, this paper analyzes and compares English and Chinese literature, and summarizes the theoretical research status from three aspects: Theoretical basis, optimization decision-making and risk management. Finally, there are three development trends of supply chain finance in the future, that is, the formation of healthy network ecosystem is an important basis for the development of supply chain finance, the adoption of modern Fintech enabling is a powerful tool for the development of supply chain finance, and bearing the social responsibility of sustainable development is the long-term goal of supply chain finance development. Meanwhile, it gives five key research issues that deserve attention. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China. All right reserved.

More than 213 Countries and Territories around the world have affected by the coronavirus COVID-19 and many more nations have been going through most critical situations in health and financial contexts as well. So many major attempts are made practicing to overcome negative impacts of this viral infection but there is no permanent solution has not been found yet. No availability of either vaccine or therapeutic antiviral drugs till now in any country to prevent and cure this infection. As the COVID19 infections were asymptomatic, the proper serodiagnostic tools also very essential besides the real time PCR as it takes much time for the results. Some of the practices have been running continuously like detection methods and alternative treatments for this major virus respiratory infection. But the major issue to be resolved patients are found be in again re-infection by COVID19. © International Knowledge Press. All rights reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality workforce in situ between mid-April and June 2020. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper that brings together a variety of sources and intelligence relating the impacts on hospitality work of the COVID-19 pandemic at three levels: macro (global, policy, government), meso (organisational) and micro (employee). It questions whether the situations faced by hospitality workers as a result of the pandemic are seed-change different from the precarious lives they normally lead or just a (loud) amplification of the “normal”. Findings: In light of the fluid environment relating to COVID-19, conclusions are tentative and question whether hospitality stakeholders, particularly consumers, governments and the industry itself, will emerge from the pandemic with changed attitudes to hospitality work and hospitality workers. Practical implications: This raises questions about hospitality work for key stakeholders to address in the future, some of which are systemic in terms of how precarious labour forces, critical to the global economy are to be considered by policy makers, organisations in a re-emerging competitive market for talent and for those who chose (or not) to work in hospitality. Social implications: This paper contributes to ongoing debates about precarious work and the extent to which such practices are institutionalised and adopts an “amplification model” that may have value in futures-orientated analysis about hospitality and tourism. Originality/value: This paper is wholly original and a reflection on the COVID-19 crisis. It provides a point of wider reference with regard to responses to crises and their impact on employment in hospitality, highlighting how ongoing change, fluidity and uncertainty serve to magnify and exacerbate the precarious nature of work in the industry. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The sport sector has been especially influenced by the COVID-19 crisis in a way that has never been seen before. This has meant an urgent need for most sport enterprises to think about new business models in order to cope with the change. The purpose of this article is to discuss in more detail how the sport sector can utilise entrepreneurship as a way of combatting uncertainty whilst promoting the recognition of new opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the existing literature on COVID-19 in terms of crisis management, entrepreneurship and sport is undertaken. This helps to understand the linkage between sport and entrepreneurship and how this can be used in times of the COVID-19 crisis. Findings: All sport businesses, athletes, managers, fans and consumers need to utilise entrepreneurial thinking in order to act creatively. This will help combat the unease and uncertainty, associated with the COVID-19 crisis and create more entrepreneurial ecosystems to develop. Originality/value: This article is the first to explicitly state the need for sport businesses to harness the entrepreneurial potential of the COVID-19 crisis thereby contributing to new practices that will help the sport sector survive this uncertain time period and flourish in the future. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Resource-poor countries with weaker health systems are struggling with epidemics of their own and are now in a more uncertain situation with this rapidly spreading infection. Frontline healthcare workers are succumbing to the infection in their efforts to save lives. There is an urgency to develop treatments for COVID-19, yet there is limited clinical data on the efficacy of potential drug treatments. Countries worldwide implemented a stay-at-home order to “flatten the curve” and relieve the pressure on the health system, but it is uncertain how this will unfold after the economy reopens. Trehalose, a natural glucose disaccharide, is known to impair viral function through the autophagy system. Here, we propose trehalose as a potential preventative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. © Copyright © 2020 Martinon, Borges, Gomez and Shimada. autophagy; COVID-19; prophylaxis; SARS-CoV-2; trehalose interleukin 1beta; peptides and proteins; transcription factor eb; trehalose; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; trehalose; adult respiratory distress syndrome; autophagy (cellular); clinical trial (topic); contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; cross presentation; cytokine release; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; herd immunity; human; infection control; nonhuman; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virus replication; virus transmission; adult; aged; asymptomatic disease; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; middle aged; pandemic; physiology; post exposure prophylaxis; pre-exposure prophylaxis; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Asymptomatic Diseases; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Post-Exposure Prophylaxis; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Trehalose; Virus Replication COVID-19: Emergence of Infectious Diseases, Nanotechnology Aspects, Challenges, and Future Perspectives Wuhan, a city of China, is the epicenter for the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses. The antiviral drugs and their clinical advances, along with herbal medicines for viral inhibition and immunity boosters, are described. Elaboration of tables related to CoVs for the compilation of the literature has been adopted for the better understanding. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This paper aims to assess the initial response undertaken by Central European companies in the early stages of the outbreak. The survey was conducted as a research method to collect data from a large number of companies. Since it takes time to assess long-term effects of the pandemic and related measures, various changes in supply chains are examined as the early results of the COVID-19 crisis and measures implemented by companies. The study examines how different economy sectors were changed due to this situation. The changes in operating volumes were identified as the most commonly used measures to accommodate new market developments. However, developing the new supply chain partnership was the most successful measure. This measure correlates with an increase in revenues and an increase in the number of customers. In some cases, disruptions in supply chains had positive effects on revenues as a reaction to the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. Cross-country examinations found that all Polish companies implemented at least one new measure to tackle this crisis. Nearly 20% of Slovak companies and nearly 30% of Czech companies made no changes in their operations during the early stages of the crisis. However, overall, the supply chains in Central European countries turned out to be quite resilient, since most companies managed to survive the supply chain disruptions and in some cases even show signs of overcoming them completely. © 2020 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a conceptual one based on a review of literature relating to the acquisiting and use of secondary residences or “second homes”. Findings: This paper observes that the secondary residence is often the object of a material over-investment that is symbolic and mental. The owners never quite leave their main place of residence when in the secondary one. The result is not two complementary spaces, but a hybrid space made up of the interlocking of the two. This paper also concludes that digitalization has made it easier to rent a secondary residence for a short period of time, using for instance the Airbnb platform, thus making it more an object of trade than a second home. From a sustainability perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring to the relatively rapid growth of short-term renting a halt. Further, it may encourage owners to be more psychologically and physically invested in their secondary residence, thereby contributing more to the local economy. Originality/value: Few authors have considered the way digital tools can alter the relation with the secondary place of residence. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

COVID-19 is unique in that it is spread through everyday contact with other people. Therefore, social protective measures, beyond medical protective measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, border closures, and human tracing are initiated to control the spread of COVID-19. Such responses have produced secondary issues such as drastic changes in people’s way of life and work, housing instability, economic shock, and privacy issues. This paper examines the four domains of urban and regional issues related to the secondary impact of COVID-19, including (1) social distancing, urban structure, community, and density; (2) housing affordability; (3) lockdowns, border closures, reshoring, and regional economic recovery; and (4) smart city technology, contact tracing, and privacy. The following six recommendations have been proposed. First, institutional and cultural factors are more important than urban features, such as population density. To handle infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it is important to build systems, technology, infrastructure, and urban structures that can strengthen resilience instead of implementing a directionless policy of dispersion. Second, it is necessary to improve accessibility to essential services at the community level, including medical facilities and food supply. Third, continuous effort should be made to boost housing affordability, as it is directly related to people’s basic life. Fourth, measures are needed to protect those people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. There is also the need to restore global trade and economic relations. Fifth, since data technology-based COVID-19 control raises the human tracing and privacy issue, we must ensure the principles of privacy management, such as transparency and voluntary consent, are being met. Finally, since COVID-19 is spread through people, individuals may become anxious and fearful of others without grounds; this may increase prejudice and hatred, including xenophobia. Significant social effort is needed to overcome such ill-defined anxiety and fear and maintain a healthy civil society. © 2020 The Institute of Urban Sciences. community; COVID-19; density; housing; pandemic; privacy; regional economy; smart city; urban and regional planning  Stuck in neutral? Federalism, policy instruments, and counter-cyclical responses to COVID-19 in the United States Federalism plays a foundational role in structuring public expectations about how the United States will respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, as both an unprecedented public-health crisis and an economic recession. As in prior crises, state governments are expected to be primary sites of governing authority, especially when it comes to immediate public-health needs, while it is assumed that the federal government will supply critical counter-cyclical measures to stabilize the economy and make up for major revenue shortfalls in the states. Yet there are reasons to believe that these expectations will not be fulfilled, especially when it comes to the critical juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the federal government has the capacity to engage in counter-cyclical spending to stabilize the economy, existing policy instruments vary in the extent to which they leverage that capacity. This leverage, we argue, depends on how decentralized policy arrangements affect the implementation of both discretionary emergency policies as well as automatic stabilization programs such as Unemployment Insurance, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Evidence on the US response to COVID-19 to date suggests the need for major revisions in the architecture of intergovernmental fiscal policy. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

With the development of global economy and the improvement of living standard, the incidence of diabetes is increasing year by year. And it is more common in the elderly. COVID-19 is associated with much chronic disease, especially diabetes. At present, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality based on large scale of data between diabetes and COVID-19 all over the world. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The databases of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Wanfang Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database (CNKI) and VIP were searched by computer, and the researches related to diabetes mellitus and mortality of COVID-19 were collected. The searching time was from the establishment of the database to April 30 2020. The meta-analysis was carried out by Review Manager Version 5.3 and stata 14.0 software for Mac software after 2 researchers independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the bias risk. The main outcome was the mortality of COVID-19 which was included in meta-analysis and subgroup analysis. The bias of the study was evaluated independently by NOS scale, and published by funnel chart. The sensitivity was analyzed row by row. RESULTS: The results will be published at a peer-reviewed journal.Registration number: INPLASY202040158.

It can spread among animals and has been reported to be transmitted from animal to human. COVID-19 cases have been increasing day by day and its economic impact on poor people has brought them down. The main aim of the study is to study the knowledge and awareness of the general public about the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. An online survey was conducted with a self-structured questionnaire comprising 15 questions that were distributed through the google forms among 100 subjects. The data were collected and the results were statistically analyzed. 65% of the participants were aware of COVID-19 and the economic impact caused due to this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world and the number of cases is increasing rapidly. Analyzing all the challenges, it was understood that participants were aware of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research. All rights reserved.

Processes of Formalization and the Circular Economy Post-COVID-19 The effects of COVID-19 have been severe in developing countries. It has been a particularly difficult time for informal small-scale farmers who live in rural areas and lack formal safety nets. These farmers are the cornerstone of national food security strategies. In this perspectives article, we discuss how circular economy principles could help these farmers reduce their states of vulnerability whilst engaging with nonlinear pathways of formalization. We argue that circular principles can go hand-in-glove with processes of formalization as long as interventions are made to help informal small-scale farmers overcome structural problems. We make a series of recommendations for policy makers and other stakeholders. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

Using a case study from Canada, this paper examines how the political dynamics of industry-Indigenous relations have changed and speculates about how these dynamics might continue to change in the future. The economic crisis has already intensified political conflicts and struggles between Indigenous peoples and mining, oil, and gas companies. We identify and discuss four points of conflict between Indigenous communities and extractive industries that have become more acute as a result of the current economic crisis. It is important for researchers to pay close attention to how these conflicts are affected by the pandemic, in order to help Indigenous communities develop strategies to cope with changes in industry-Indigenous relations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Canada; COVID-19; Indigenous politics  Current status of potential therapeutic candidates for the COVID-19 crisis As of April 15, 2020, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic has swept through 213 countries and infected more than 1,870,000 individuals, posing an unprecedented threat to international health and the economy. There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In developing economies and regions, the pandemic's disruption of the agriculture commodity supply chain has made it difficult for smallholder farmers to exist. Smallholder farmer's traditional struggles have worsened. However, technology may provide promise of improving conditions for vulnerable farmers even in a period of crises such as the COVID-19 period. In this article, we draw on lessons learned in developed and developing countries to propose critical digital transformation for building a resilient and sustainable post-COVID-19 supply chains for developing countries, especially for smallholder farmers operating in global value chains. We discuss how digital technologies and specifically digital inclusion of smallholder farmers can prevent major disruptions from damaging the livelihoods of society's most vulnerable. We discuss feasibility and provide some caveats for a post-COVID-19 digital inclusion in developing countries. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

The new and fast dynamics of the pandemic are challenging the health systems of different countries. In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, mitigation policies, such as social isolation and lock-down of cities, have been adopted, but the results vary among different countries. Some countries were able to control the disease at the moment, as is the case of South Korea. Others, like Italy, are now experiencing the peak of the pandemic. Finally, countries with emerging economies and social issues, like Brazil, are in the initial phase of the pandemic. In this work, we use mathematical models with time-dependent coefficients, techniques of inverse and forward uncertainty quantification, and sensitivity analysis to characterize essential aspects of the COVID-19 in the three countries mentioned above. The model parameters estimated for South Korea revealed effective social distancing and isolation policies, border control, and a high number in the percentage of reported cases. In contrast, underreporting of cases was estimated to be very high in Brazil and Italy. In addition, the model estimated a poor isolation policy at the moment in Brazil, with a reduction of contact around 40%, whereas Italy and South Korea estimated numbers for contact reduction are at 75% and 90%, respectively. This characterization of the COVID-19, in these different countries under different scenarios and phases of the pandemic, supports the importance of mitigation policies, such as social distancing. In addition, it raises serious concerns for socially and economically fragile countries, where underreporting poses additional challenges to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic by significantly increasing the uncertainties regarding its dynamics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Epidemiology; Mathematical modeling; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty quantification Disease control; Estimation; Sensitivity analysis; Border control; Emerging economies; Mitigation policies; Mitigation strategy; Model parameters; Social isolation; Time-dependent coefficients; Uncertainty quantifications; Uncertainty analysis Effects of COVID-19 on Indian energy consumption Just after the Indian government issued the first lockdown rule to cope with the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in March 2020, the energy consumption in India plummeted dramatically. However, as the lockdown relaxed, energy consumption started to recover. In this study, we investigated how COVID-19 cases affected Indian energy consumption during the COVID-19 crisis by testing if the lockdown release had a positive impact on energy consumption and if richer regions were quicker to recover their energy consumption to the level before the lockdown. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the study reveals that a long-run relationship holds between the COVID-19 cases and energy consumption and that the COVID-19 cases have a positive effect on Indian energy consumption. This result indicates that as lockdown relaxed, energy consumption started to recover. However, such a positive impact was not apparent in the Eastern and North-Eastern regions, which are the poorest regions among the five regions investigated in the study. This implies that poorer regions need special aid and policy to recover their economy from the damage suffered from the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020 by the authors.

A systematic literature review of Coronavirus related diseases in Pakistan Pakistan is also seeing the profound effect of the outbreak of COVID-19, which demands an urgent investigation of literature and further scientific investigation for cure and prevention. This study has employed the systematic approach for searching the literature from the recently compiled database of researches namely COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and related diseases. The literature on Pakistan has shown the evidence of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission of viruses, the presence of antibodies of MERS-CoV in camels, and careless attitude towards preventive measures of such respiratory diseases. There is a lot of gap in the literature regarding coronaviruses and their antibodies creating herd immunity for another coronavirus and COVID-19. In particular to Pakistan, and in general, for other developing countries, a weak health-care system coupled with the trembling economy has many implications of COVID-19 which should be carefully thought-out to combat the spread. © 2020 Haq et al.

The rate of infection fastens everyday, where India stands 6th among all the countries in the world. Daily wage workers are the most affected personalities due to to covid-19 lockdown. Although many organisations help them and take them into attention, still a lot of them continue to struggle. The aim of the study is to create and test the extent of awareness on various effects of COVID-19 on daily wage workers. A self-assessed questionnaire comprising about 12 questions were passed on to 109 individuals through an online platform “google forms”. The responses were collected and analysed using SPSS software. Most of the respondents are aware about the various issues faced by the workers in their day to day life. They can also coexist in this society with us, after the massacre that is caused to them due to the lockdown, if we show some gratitude towards them. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

Compared with its neighbors China and Iran, which were rated as epi-centers of the outbreak, Pakistan has lower standards of health care, unstable economy and dearth of financial resources to tackle the outbreak. Like other institutes and industries in the country, clinical laboratories were succumbed to a variety of challenges. This article is based on the experience and adapted workflow measures from the Clinical Chemistry laboratory at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, which serves as a national referral center with its widespread network of satellite laboratories and phlebotomy centers across the country. It highlights the challenges faced and the appropriate responses to ensure the provision of diagnostic facilities during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the lessons acquired and necessary preparations for the post crisis situation are also incorporated. © 2020 Challenges; COVID-19; Laboratory; Lessons; Pakistan accreditation; biochemical analysis; clinical laboratory; clinical practice; compensation; coronavirus disease 2019; developing country; disease surveillance; epidemic; good laboratory practice; health care policy; housekeeping; human; medical education; pandemic; point of care testing; priority journal; psychological well-being; quality control; Review; salary; social distance; virtual learning environment; work; workflow COVID-19 healthcare planning: Predicting mortality and the role of the herd immunity barrier in the general population Using a mathematical model for COVID-19 incorporating data on excess of mortality compared to the corresponding period of the previous year obtained from the daily monitoring of mortality in Spain (MoMo), the prediction of total number of casualties in Spain for the first outbreak has been computed. From this figure, and following a stepwise meta-analysis of available reports, the case fatality rate (CFR) and the infectious case fatality rate (IFR) for the outbreak have been estimated. As the impact of age on these rates is notable, it is proposed to include an age-related adjusted fatality ratio in future comparative analyses between studies, calculated by adjusting the results by risk ratio to a reference age band (e.g., 60-69). From the casualty figures, and the corresponding CFR and IFR ratios, the forecast of serologically positive cases in the general Spanish population has been estimated at approximately 1% (0.87-1.3%) of the samples. If the data are confirmed by the ongoing study of the Carlos III Institute, until a vaccine is found, the immunity acquired in the general population after the infectious outbreak is far from the 65-70% herd immunity required as a barrier for COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper offers a critical and context-based approach to understanding globalization and localization by challenging the conceptualization of ‘value’ and ‘risk’ within the current global production networks framework as well as identifying key operational strategies in risk management and national security. An analysis of the adaptation strategies of the GPNs of 91 companies identifies the role played by four different forms of value in configuring production networks. This is to balance ‘economic value’ with non-price-based sources of value and alternative values. The analysis underscores the critical role of the state in ensuring national and human security as well as its increasing power as a key actor in GPNs and the global economy. © 2020 Royal Dutch Geographical Society / Koninklijk Nederlands Aardrijkskundig China-United States trade war; COVID-19; evolutionary economic geography; global production networks; risk; value  COVID-19 and economy [краткое описание не найдено]  Chinese; communicable disease control; coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; global health; government; gross national product; human; industrial production; Letter; primary infection Addressing inequality: The first step beyond COVID-19 and towards sustainability The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted billions of lives across the world and has revealed and worsened the social and economic inequalities that have emerged over the past several decades. As governments consider public health and economic strategies to respond to the crisis, it is critical they also address the weaknesses of their economic and social systems that inhibited their ability to respond comprehensively to the pandemic. These same weaknesses have also undermined efforts to advance equality and sustainability. This paper explores over 30 interventions across the following nine categories of change that hold the potential to address inequality, provide all citizens with access to essential goods and services, and advance progress towards sustainability: (1) Income and wealth transfers to facilitate an equitable increase in purchasing power/disposable income; (2) broadening worker and citizen ownership of the means of production and supply of services, allowing corporate profit-taking to be more equitably distributed; (3) changes in the supply of essential goods and services for more citizens; (4) changes in the demand for more sustainable goods and services desired by people; (5) stabilizing and securing employment and the workforce; (6) reducing the disproportionate power of corporations and the very wealthy on the market and political system through the expansion and enforcement of antitrust law such that the dominance of a few firms in critical sectors no longer prevails; (7) government provision of essential goods and services such as education, healthcare, housing, food, and mobility; (8) a reallocation of government spending between military operations and domestic social needs; and (9) suspending or restructuring debt from emerging and developing countries. Any interventions that focus on growing the economy must also be accompanied by those that offset the resulting compromises to health, safety, and the environment from increasing unsustainable consumption. This paper compares and identifies the interventions that should be considered as an important foundational first step in moving beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and towards sustainability. In this regard, it provides a comprehensive set of strategies that could advance progress towards a component of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 to reduce inequality within countries. However, the candidate interventions are also contrasted with all 17 SDGs to reveal potential problem areas/tradeoffs that may need careful attention. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus, it is important to understand how global factors linked with the functioning of the Anthropocene are responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. We tested hypotheses that the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths and growth rate of recorded infections: (1) are positively associated with population density as well as (2) proportion of the human population living in urban areas as a proxies of interpersonal contact rate, (3) age of the population in a given country as an indication of that population's susceptibility to COVID-19; (4) net migration rate and (5) number of tourists as proxies of infection pressure, and negatively associated with (5) gross domestic product which is a proxy of health care quality. Data at the country level were compiled from publicly available databases and analysed with gradient boosting regression trees after controlling for confounding factors (e.g. geographic location). We found a positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases in a given country and gross domestic product, number of tourists, and geographic longitude. The number of deaths was positively associated with gross domestic product, number of tourists in a country, and geographic longitude. The effects of gross domestic product and number of tourists were non-linear, with clear thresholds above which the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased rapidly. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was positively linked to the number of tourists and gross domestic product. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was negatively associated with the mean age of the population and geographic longitude. Growth was slower in less urbanised countries. This study demonstrates that the characteristics of the human population and high mobility, but not population density, may help explain the global spread of the virus. In addition, geography, possibly via climate, may play a role in the pandemic. The unexpected positive and strong association between gross domestic product and number of cases, deaths, and growth rate suggests that COVID-19 may be a new civilisation disease affecting rich economies. © 2020 Skórka et al.

While lockdowns may be an important tool to limit transmission, they come at a potentially great cost with regard to economic impact, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from non–COVID-19 diseases. Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries. Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to “unlock” or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. “Precision physical distancing”—distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings—is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19. It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures. Precision physical distancing can be one important component of a sustainable long-term solution that is proportionate to the risk yet does not have a disproportionate impact on society and the economy, allowing a partial return to normal activities, with the community as an essential partner.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused more than 3.7 million infected people and 260000 deaths over 210 countries around the world from December 2019 to May 7, 2020, which has seriously affected the safety of people, the stability of social order, and the development of the economy. Therefore, it is urgent to explore and implement new prevention and control programs for such major pandemics. With the development of robots and artificial intelligence technologies, various intelligent robots for emergency prevention and control in complex conditions have emerged, and they have played paramount roles in disease prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing. Based on the problems of insufficient supply of materials and heavy disinfection tasks during the prevention and control of major outbreaks, we study the systematic procedures and applications of medical material handling robots, multi-scene disinfection robots, medical assistant robots, prevention and control robots, and production resumption robots. Moreover, we comparatively analyze the current situation of key technologies of pandemic emergency prevention and control robots, such as environmental perception, autonomous navigation, motion planning, and 5G communication technology. In conclusion, we put forward a technical prospect of intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics. © 2020, Science Press.

The virus uses its spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain to interact with host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) sites to initiate a cascade of events that culminate in severe acute respiratory syndrome in some individuals. In efforts to curtail viral spread, authorities initiated far-reaching lockdowns that have disrupted global economies. The scientific and medical communities are mounting serious efforts to limit this pandemic and subsequent waves of viral spread by developing preventative vaccines and repurposing existing drugs as potential therapies. In this review, we focus on the latest developments in COVID-19 vaccine development, including results of the first Phase I clinical trials and describe a number of the early candidates that are emerging in the field. We seek to provide a balanced coverage of the seven main platforms used in vaccine development that will lead to a desired target product profile for the “ideal” vaccine. Using tales of past vaccine discovery efforts that have taken many years or that have failed, we temper over exuberant enthusiasm with cautious optimism that the global medical community will reach the elusive target to treat COVID-19 and end the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Funk, Laferrière and Ardakani. clinical trial; coronavirus; COVID-19; immune response; public health; SARS-CoV-2; vaccine advac; azd 1222; bnt 162; coronavac; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; COVID 19 vaccine; DNA vaccine; inactivated virus vaccine; ino 4800; live vaccine; messenger RNA 1273; nvxcov 237; nvxcov 2373; per.c6; placebo; recombinant protein; RNA vaccine; scb 2019; unclassified drug; coronavirus disease 2019; drug design; drug research; drug targeting; human; Human adenovirus 5; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptomatology; treatment indication; vaccination; virus genome; virus transmission Covid-19 Outbreak In Italy: Are We Ready for the Psychosocial and the Economic Crisis? Baseline Findings From the PsyCovid Study The Covid-19 pandemic is burning all over the world. National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding the psychosocial and economic effects is growing quickly. The PsyCovid Study assessed the influence of psychosocial variables on individual differences from the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the issues of health and economy in the Italian population. Italian volunteers from different regions completed an online anonymous survey. The main outcomes were the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health and the economy. A two-way MANOVA evaluated differences in the main outcomes, with geographical area (northern, central, and southern regions) and professional status (healthcare workers or not) as factors. We then tested the relationship linking psychosocial variables (i.e. perceived distress and social isolation, empathy, and coping style) to the main outcomes through two different mediation models. 1163 responders completed the survey (835 females; mean age: 42 ± 13.5 y.o.; age range: 18-81 y.o.) between March 14 and 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and people living in northern Italy reported a significantly worse outbreak impact on health, but not on the economy. In the whole sample, distress and loneliness were key variables influencing the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health, while empathy and coping style affected the perceived impact on the economy. The Covid-19 pandemic is a worldwide emergency in terms of psychological, social, and economic consequences. Our data suggests that in the Italian population, actual differences in individual perception of the Covid-19 outbreak severity for health are dramatically modulated by psychosocial frailty (i.e., distress and loneliness). At the same time, problem-oriented coping strategies and enhanced empathic abilities increase people's awareness of the severity of the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on economics. There is an immediate need for consensus guidelines and healthcare policies to support interventions aimed to manage psychosocial distress and increase population resilience towards the imminent crisis. © Copyright © 2020 Cerami, Santi, Galandra, Dodich, Cappa, Vecchi and Crespi. coping abilities; Covid-19 outbreak; distress; economic crisis; empathy; loneliness; perceived impact on health; psychosocial frailty adult; aged; Article; awareness; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; distress syndrome; economic aspect; economic crisis; empathy; epidemic; female; human; Italian (citizen); Italy; loneliness; major clinical study; male; perception; psychosocial care; risk factor; social isolation; young adult ECMO use in COVID-19: Lessons from past respiratory virus outbreaks - A narrative review The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to grow exponentially in most countries, posing an unprecedented burden on the healthcare sector and the world economy. Previous respiratory virus outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic H1N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), have provided significant insights into preparation and provision of intensive care support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Many patients have already been supported with ECMO during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and it is likely that many more may receive ECMO support, although, at this point, the role of ECMO in COVID-19-related cardiopulmonary failure is unclear. Here, we review the experience with the use of ECMO in the past respiratory virus outbreaks and discuss potential role for ECMO in COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).

Based on Granger test, questionnaire survey, enterprise research and expert interview, the overall impacts of shipping and port industry were evaluated. Focusing on different market segments, the different impacts on ports, containers, tankers, dry bulk cargoes, cruise ships and other subdivisions were evaluated. Combined with the current difficulties of the shipping and port industry, major countermeasures were put forward. Research result shows that the COVID-19 epidemic has taken a severe recession on global economy, trade and industry, and has been transmitted to the shipping industry by global supply chains. There is a strong Granger causal relationship between the COVID-19 daily new cases and the Baltic Dry Index. In the first quarter of 2020, the throughput of cargo and containers of main monitored ports in China were 105 353×104 t and 3 766.6×104 TEU, respectively, and year-on-year decrease by 3.5% and 8.6%, respectively. The epidemic has a greater short-term impact on dry bulk cargo, containers and oil tankers. In February 2020, the throughput of the eight major container hub ports declined by 19.8% year-on-year, and cruise passenger transport was hit by the overall closure. The recovery will be a slow process, and the COVID-19 epidemic will continue to have a negative impact on the shipping and port industry. It is suggested that some measures are put forward such as strengthening overseas port policy and port linking tracking, avoiding ship charter disputes and legal risks, improving the system of prevention and control of cruise ships, and promoting the development of smart ports and smart shipping. 3 tabs, 8 figs, 32 refs. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

It has also sparked fears of an impending economic crisis and recession. Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions have lead to a reduced workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast, the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector is also facing increased demand due to panic-buying and stockpiling of food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy. © 2020 IJS Publishing Group Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Economic impact; Economy; SARS-CoV-2 agriculture; aviation; China; coronavirus disease 2019; domestic violence; drug industry; economic aspect; education; Europe; finance; food industry; game addiction; health care industry; hospital; housing; human; Japan; manufacturing industry; oil industry; pandemic; petrochemical industry; priority journal; real estate; research; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social media; socioeconomics; sport; tourism; United Kingdom; United States; Betacoronavirus; catering service; commercial phenomena; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; economics; employment; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Commerce; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Employment; Food Supply; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Socioeconomic Factors Base protocol for real time active random surveillance of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) – Adapting veterinary methodology to public health The pandemic of new coronavirus disease COVID-19 is threatening our health, economy and life style. Collaborations across countries and sectors as a One Health World could be a milestone. We propose a general protocol, for setting timely active random surveillance of COVID-19, at the human community level, with systematic repeated detection efforts. Strengths and limitations are discussed. If considered applicable by public health, the protocol could evaluate the status of COVID-19 epidemics consistently and objectively. © 2020 The Authors Active random surveillance; COVID-19; New coronavirus; Pandemic apparent prevalence; Article; clinical protocol; communicable disease control; confidence interval; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease surveillance; health care system; human; measurement precision; prevalence; probability; public health; randomization; SARS-related coronavirus; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; true prevalence; veterinary medicine; virus transmission Covid-19: Crisis of globalization and “revenge of the border”.

The pandemic is entering a phase of global instability, linked to the tensions caused by the trade war between the United States and China, as well as the slowdown of the economy and the growth of populisms. In this sense, the consequences of the pandemic have caused the greatest shock to the international order since the Second World War. © 2020 Universita degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata.

Whereas it is essential that their conservation, management, and enjoyment are sustainable, it is also necessary that the environmental, cultural, and socio-economic contexts in which they are integrated are sustainable too. Like other amenities, BHRs can improve the quality of the urban environment and generate externalities; additionally, they may influence sectors such as real estate, hospitality, and tourism. In this framework, this contribution aims to identify spatial relationships occurring between BHRs and short-term rentals (STRs), i.e., a recent economic phenomenon facilitated by platforms such as Airbnb. Through the application of Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis techniques and taking Turin (Italy) as a case study, this article provides evidence that spatial correlation patterns between BHRs and STRs exist, and that the areas most affected by STRs are the residential neighborhoods located in the proximity of the historic center of the city. Relations with other sets of socio-economic variables are highlighted too, and conclusions suggest that future studies are essential not only to monitor sustainability issues and reflect on new housing models and sustainable uses of buildings, but also to understand the evolution of the phenomenon in light of the pandemic Covid-19. © 2020 by the authors.

We examined how blockchain is likely to affect key supply chain management objectives such as cost, quality, speed, dependability, risk reduction, sustainability and flexibility. The authors attempt to classify different kinds of tokens and explain the terminology related to cryptocurrencies. They analyze the economic development of tokens and legal regulation surrounding their usage in supply chain. The study revealed the advantages of using digital technlogies in supply chain management over traditional business management technologies and logistics systems, especially in covid-19 conditions. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.

In this review, we comprehensively investigate the various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic, taking advantage of data generated in Asia and Europe at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic spread. Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research. In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging. We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer. As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed. As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to further challenge cancer care in several countries. © 2020, The Author(s).  arbidol; corticosteroid; ganciclovir; immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; ribavirin; antiviral therapy; Asia; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer research; cancer therapy; caregiver; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; emotional stress; health care; health care personnel; health care system; human; infection prevention; infection risk; mental health care; oncology ward; pandemic; patient isolation; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; socioeconomics; vulnerable population Global COVID-19: Warnings and suggestions based on experience of China Background Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world currently, seriously threatening people's health and global security as an international public health emergency. The objective of this study is to summarize China's countermeasures and experience in response to the COVID-19 emergence in order to serve as a warning for the global COVID-19 prevention and control, and further provide some suggestions for global fighting to COVID-19. Methods Content analysis, expert consultation, and high frequency word analysis were applied in this study. Relevant data and information were collected from official websites, the experience accumulated in China during the fighting to the novel coronavirus, and suggestions from some experts. Results As of March 29, 2020, China had accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.01%; in the mean time, the global had accumulated 596 042 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.76%. Although the mortality of COVID-19 was not so high, its harmfulness couldn't be ignored. Ten facts during COVID-19 epidemic in China were summarized in the study, including: the COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread through many channels; although elderly people and people with underlying diseases are susceptible, young people can also be victims; isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and secondary disasters induced by COVID-19 should be emphasized in advance. High frequent words of experts' suggestions mainly includes: material, prevention and control, pathogeny, propaganda, education, hygiene, technology, medical care, overall planning, policy, panic, etc. The main concerns of experts are from four aspects: publicity and education, various subjects, medical materials and law construction. Conclusions COVID-19 is a new infectious disease worldwide, and its infectious source, transmission route, susceptible population, and therapy are not clear. In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, no country can stand alone to maintain its own safety. People from all over the world should put aside their difference in ideology, religious belief, politics, economy, and culture, and only by global cooperation and globally unified actions, can we successfully overcome COVID-19 in the end. © 2020 The Author(s).

Above all, from the beginning of the new millennium, scholars and practitioners have paid an increasing attention to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in operational processes management and challenges for new business models, in a sustainable and socially responsible perspective. Thus, the stakeholders can assume a proactive or marginal role in the value creation for business, according to their own environmental awareness. These issues appear still ""open"" in some industries, such as the agri-food system, where the adoption of new technologies requires rethinking and redesigning the whole business model. Methodologically, we brought forward an in-depth review of the literature about major articles in this field. Especially, the study has been conducted following two phases: firstly, we extracted from scientific databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) and studied relevant articles; secondly, we analyzed the selected articles. The findings highlight interesting issues about AI towards a ""space economy"" to achieve sustainable and responsible business models, also in the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

Evidence from smooth time-varying cointegration analysis Background: The stimulus coupon plan is one of the economic relief plans used to boost Taiwan's slumping economy in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. In order to obtain prior information to understand whether or not the stimulus coupon plan would effectively revive the economy in advance, the purpose of this study is to learn lessons from Taiwan's consumption voucher scheme initiated during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis through evaluating the effect of the consumption voucher scheme on private consumption expenditure. Methods: The smooth time-varying cointegration analysis was applied to estimate the income elasticity of consumption, indicating the individual's reaction to consumption vouchers in terms of private consumption expenditure, and then the multiple structural change model was estimated to identify endogenous regime changes of the income elasticity of consumption. Results: We found that the income elasticity of consumption dramatically decreased after 2007Q1, a period that covered the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007-2009 and the time of issuance of the consumption vouchers in 2009. Conclusions: We concluded that Taiwan's consumption voucher scheme might have had either no or little effect on stimulating the economy, so policymakers should be cautioned concerning the potential ineffectiveness of the stimulus coupon plan in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

Arguably, agricultural producers and the retail industry appear to be the best placed to weather the storm in order to respond to such a change in demand. However, this is overly simplistic.

Modelling the Economic Impact and Ripple Effects of Disease Outbreaks The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has had alarming effects on human lives and the economies of affected countries. With the world’s manufacturing hubs experiencing a period of extended factory closures, the economic impact transcends territorial borders via global supply chains. This paper provides a roadmap on how to evaluate the vulnerability that cascades through the supply chain due to a disease outbreak at the firm level, national level, and global scale. The final extent of losses is not yet known, but the development of economic models combined with epidemiological models and network analysis techniques can yield more realistic estimates to select appropriate strategies in a timely manner. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

The virus, unlike other recent epidemics, has resulted in the closing of many schools, businesses, and healthcare facilities. Much of the virus's impact is yet to be determined, however, what has been observed is that children are much less affected than adults and their case fatality is low across the world. Although the adults who care for children at home and in healthcare settings may be at risk, there are many strategies that are being implemented across the nation to address viral spread and move toward business as usual. Government policies that are currently being developed should consider the impact they will have on public health and the economy because they are both intimately intertwined in the daily workings of our nation. We urge consideration of the longterm impact that the pandemic may have on children. Furthermore, we insist that public and private institutions at all levels consider policies and programs that account for children and the indirect and direct deleterious effects that the pandemic is having on their development and well-being. Children in need of surgery have different considerations compared with adult patients with regard to decision-making, convalescence, and long-term outcomes. As children are our future, let us consider mitigation strategies and solutions that can give them the best chance at success. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.  child health; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; economic aspect; health care personnel; health care planning; health education; hospital admission; human; intraoperative period; intubation; model; patient care; perioperative period; postoperative period; preoperative period; prevalence; priority journal; Review; surgery; United States; wellbeing; child; Coronavirus infection; economic recession; elective surgery; endotracheal intubation; extubation; family; mass screening; pandemic; perioperative period; procedures; protective equipment; severity of illness index; time to treatment; virus pneumonia; Airway Extubation; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Economic Recession; Elective Surgical Procedures; Family; Health Personnel; Humans; Intubation, Intratracheal; Mass Screening; Pandemics; Perioperative Care; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; Time-to-Treatment A review on sars-cov-2 virology, pathophysiology, animal models, and anti-viral interventions Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic and transmissible CoV that is presently plaguing the global human population and economy. No proven effective antiviral therapy or vaccine currently exists, and supportive care remains to be the cornerstone treatment. Through previous lessons learned from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV studies, scientific groups worldwide have rapidly expanded the knowledge pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 virology that includes in vitro and in vivo models for testing of antiviral therapies and randomized clinical trials. In the present narrative, we review SARS-CoV-2 virology, clinical features, pathophysiology, and animal models with a specific focus on the antiviral and adjunctive therapies currently being tested or that require testing in animal models and randomized clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors.

However, due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal is not only going to lose a significant portion of remittances but will also face the Herculean task of creating employment for the workforce who may return to Nepal. This paper discusses sustainable options for the Nepali government to help create employment for its citizens in Nepal through the revitalization of fallow lands and other potential agricultural areas, which are below a 15° slope. The land-use and land-cover data for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are derived from the classification of satellite images. These classified and resampled 30 m × 30 m images along with the 30 × 30 m elevation data are brought to the Kibana Platform within the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to analyze the status of land-use and-cover conditions for the 1980 to 2010 period within nine different slope classes at an interval of 5° slope. Our findings suggest there have been massive conversions of forested areas for agricultural land at lower slope areas between 1980 and 2000, but the trend began to reverse from 2000 to 2010 as trees started coming back to the fallow agricultural lands. This happened mainly because, during the countrywide Maoist insurgency period (1996–2006), many youth first took shelter in various urban centers away from their natal homes and then emigrated to foreign countries for remittance purposes. As a result, many farmlands became fallow and barren, and agricultural productivity decreased. Consequently, Nepal, an exporter of rice and pulses until the late 1980s, started importing food grain each year. The major goals of this research are to explore: (a) if Nepal can self-sustain in agricultural products by utilizing potential agricultural lands below a 15° slope in various geographic regions; (b) the means for productively engaging the youth returning to the country; and (c) methods of reinvigorating the ecosystem services of Nepal to support sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

In this overview accompanying the Special Issue of Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews, we examine some of the many social and scientific issues impacted by SARS-CoV2 – personal lives, economy, scientific communication, the environment. International members of Istituto Pasteur in Rome and INITIATE, the Marie Curie Training Network reflect on the lasting global impact of the coronavirus pandemic. © 2020 Covid-19; global pandemic; SARS-CoV2; scientific response Article; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease burden; economic aspect; environmental factor; Europe; financial deficit; human; immunopathogenesis; infection control; mental disease; misinformation; morbidity; mortality; pandemic; priority journal; quarantine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social aspect; social distance; Western Hemisphere; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease control; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; pandemic; pathogenicity; procedures; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Distance Job satisfaction and problems among academic staff in higher education The role of a scientist in society is undoubtedly extremely important. This thesis was particularly confirmed by the global events of the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, when the spread of the COVID-19 virus revealed the helplessness of humanity in the face of a pandemic. Only intensive scientific work, having an interdisciplinary character, gives hope to stop the development of the spread of the virus. It turned out that it is scientists who are necessary to reduce mortality and morbidity, as well as the negative effects of a pandemic on the economy and public health. In this regard, it is worth discussing whether the scientific work of scientists is satisfying for them? Nowadays, the scientist is demanded for immediate effects of scientific research, implementation of inventions tailored to the emerging needs, and quick solutions to the problems of a dynamically changing society. However, along with the growing social expectations towards researchers, is their work increasingly appreciated? The aim of this article is getting to assess the level of satisfaction with scientific work among researchers and to identify the factors that influence its level. The article presents the results of research conducted on a random sample of 763 academics from Poland. The conducted scientific studies have established that: (1) The level of satisfaction of researchers concerning their own scientific work depends on employment conditions, as well as the social significance of the research carried out, (2) the level of satisfaction from work is closely correlated with the scientific opportunities of researchers (that is, the possibility of academic and didactic work, contact with students and co-workers) and negatively correlated with the necessity to carry out administrative work, and (3) the majority of Polish researchers are proud of their scientific achievements and treat their profession as a passion or vocation. © 2020 by the authors.

We discuss the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental effects of shuttering the tournament and suggest that an understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to bring about an alternative, more sustainable sports tourism economy. The cancellation of March Madness resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in tourism revenue for local economies and deprived traveler-fans of pilgrimages to arenas, important socio-cultural gathering spaces for American basketball fans. However, it also prevented the emission of a sizable quantity of greenhouse gasses based on our carbon footprint calculated from the previous year’s tournament. Ultimately, from the disruptive closing down of sport and event tourism, a post-pandemic sports tourism landscape should emerge that takes more seriously the triple-bottom line notion of balancing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the creation and maintenance of resilient local economies all while both acknowledging the important role sport plays in society and keeping tourism actors healthy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. carbon footprint; coronavirus; COVID-19; local economies; sport; Sustainable tourism COVID-19; economic impact; epidemic; health status; respiratory disease; sport; sustainability; tourism economics; tourism market; viral disease; United States; Coronavirus How to influence rural tourism intention by risk knowledge during COVID-19 containment in China: Mediating role of risk perception and attitude With both cost and safety taken into account in the context of the life-threatening COVID-19 pandemic globally, rural tourism is expected to be the top choice for Chinese residents for relaxation and enhancing parent-child relationships. In this paper, a structural equation (SEM) model was proposed to compare risk knowledge, risk perception, risk aversion attitudes and behavioral intentions towards rural tourism. According to the empirical results, there was a large proportion of tourists showing preference for rural tourism recently. Potential participants in rural tourism paid most attention to the performance realization and time cost of scenic spots, while the psycho-social risk posed by COVID-19 had little impact. The inherent risk nature of risk aversion attitudes made knowledge of the pneumonia risk less effective in reducing tourists’ intentions, while knowledge of the pneumonia risk was more effective in alleviating the risk perception that potential tourists have towards rural tourism. With regard to travel intention and recommendation intention of rural tourism, the negative impacts of risk aversion attitude were more considerable compared to risk perception. Meanwhile, the parallel mediating effect of risk perception and risk aversion attitude in rural tourism needed to be taken into consideration together. © 2020 by the authors.

Moreover, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is very high in Africa and approximates to around 62%. Nearly 75% of the total deaths due to diabetes are in individuals lesser than 60 years of age. The multifaceted disease of diabetes mellitus produces chronic complications such as, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy etc. These patients of diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to infections due to compromised immune system. Hence these patients of diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infections. The dual impact of pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections in diabetes mellitus may increase morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hence there is need of health awareness in diabetics as well in the high-risk group for diabetes such as persons with hypertension and obesity. The scarcity of health resources, shortage of trained medical personnel and disease burden of infectious and non-infectious diseases has laid a heavy impact on the economy in Africa and this has been further strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The practice of preventive measures by the risk group of Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus patients will prevent them from getting infected by COVID-19 and at the same time decrease mortality rates and hence the undiscovered group that is the patients of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus needs to be vigilant regarding safe preventive practices. © Jyoti Elgiva John et al.

The European Union has implemented numerous strategies to face emerging issues. Member States have adopted measures such as the closure of borders and significant limitations on the mobility of people to mitigate the spread of the virus. An unprecedented crisis coordination effort between Member States has facilitated the ability to purchase equipment, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies. Attention has also been focused on providing substantive money for research to find a vaccine and promote effective treatment therapies. Financial support has been made available to protect worker salaries and businesses to help facilitate a return to a functional economy. Lessons learned to date from COVID-19 in the European Union are many; the current crisis highlights the need to think about future pandemics from a population-based management approach and apply outside the box critical thinking. Due to the complexity, intensity, and frequency of complex disasters, global leaders in healthcare, government, and business will need to pivot from siloed approaches to decision-making to embrace multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary levels of cooperation. This cooperation requires courage and leadership to recognize that changes are necessary to avoid making the same mistakes we have planned countless times on avoiding. This study focuses on the European Union's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic, starting with how the European Union first learned and processed the global information arising out of China, followed by the incremental population-based medicine/management decisions made that currently are defining the European Union's capacity and capability. The capacity to organize, deliver, and monitor care to a specific clinical population under a population-based management target includes strict social distancing strategies, contact testing and tracing, testing for the virus antigen and its antibodies, isolation, and treatment modalities such as new mitigating medications, and finally, a vaccine. © 2020 by the authors.

This has been communicated in a transparent manner. Small groups of young(er) people of up to approximately 50 individuals are subject to a bigger risk of infection than others. The objective of this paper is to make a case for the argument, that alongside herd-immunity, Sweden is using the social science originated planning approach: backcasting. The government has not been transparent on backcasting. The authors present the use of backcasting only as an argument based on available data and authors' reasoning. A backcasting exercise for the case of the Swedish economy is constructed. This frame outlines five interdependent levels with which a national economy can apply what this paper calls a backcasting herd-immunity approach in its COVID-19 policy. The authors further suggest how it is possible to use social science, natural science and political ideology as complementary in COVID-19 mitigation in particular and in sustainability strategies in general. © 2020 by the authors.

While a detailed longer-term diffusion path of the new virus cannot be anticipated for individual countries, one may anticipate international supply shocks and declining GDP growth in many OECD countries and China in 2020; and one should expect falling asset prices in Asia, the United States and the European Union plus the United Kingdom – except for the price of risk-free government bonds. In the course of 2020/21 the US, the EU and the UK, as well as other countries, will face both an increasing number of infected patients as well as a higher case fatality ratio. Health care expenditures in the US could increase more than in the Eurozone and the EU in the medium term, a development that undermines the international competitiveness of the United States. The analysis suggests that per capita income is a positive function of the effective trade openness and of the new Global Health Security Index indicator from the NTI/Johns Hopkins University. A rising health care-GDP ratio in the US is equivalent to a rising US export tariff. As regards the coronavirus challenge, the ratio of acute care beds to the elderly in OECD countries shows considerable variation. Due to international tourism contraction alone, output growth in the Eurozone, the US and China can be expected to fall by about 1.6% in 2020. The COVID-19 challenge for the US Trump Administration is a serious one, since the lack of experts in the Administration will become more apparent in such a systemic stress situation – and this might well affect the November 2020 US presidential election which, in turn, would itself have considerable impacts on the UK and the EU27 as well as EU-UK trade negotiations. Integrating the health care sector into macroeconomics, which should include growth analysis, is an important task. The role of health quality - and health insurance coverage - for endogenous time horizons and economic welfare, respectively, is emphasized. © 2020, The Author(s).

This paper will not speculate on the many implications of the pandemic for people and the economy. It will only focus on the likely impact that the Covid-19 pandemic will have on smart-city development and on policies to apply digital technologies in urban development. This will be carried out by sketching 10 brief narratives that will range from: “Return to Normal after Summer” to “New Power for the Public Sector” and “Tourism at Home”. The paper will conclude with a brief assessment of winners and losers, and anticipate that smart-city development policies will experience a boost after Covid-19. © 2020, © 2020 ETH–Eidenössiche Technische Hochschule Zürich.

Quantifying the changes of pollutant emissions due to COVID-19 and associated governmental control measures is crucial to understand its impacts on economy, air pollution, and society. We used the WRF-GC model and the tropospheric NO2 column observations retrieved by the TROPOMI instrument to derive the top-down NOx emission change estimation between the three periods: P1 (January 1st to January 22nd, 2020), P2 (January 23rd, Wuhan lockdown, to February 9th, 2020), and P3 (February 10th, back-to-work day, to March 12th, 2020). We found that NOx emissions in East China averaged during P2 decreased by 50% compared to those averaged during P1. The NOx emissions averaged during P3 increased by 26% compared to those during P2. Most provinces in East China gradually regained some of their NOx emissions after February 10, the official back-to-work day, but NOx emissions in most provinces have not yet to return to their previous levels in early January. NOx emissions in Wuhan, the first epicenter of COVID-19, had no sign of emission recovering by March 12. A few provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shanxi, have recovered fast, with their averaged NOx emissions during P3 almost back to pre-lockdown levels. © 2020 by the authors.

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

The public health emergency of international concern declares the agent as the (SARS-CoV-2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The COVID-19 pandemic has an unusual way of stroking the entire world. Crises have spread rapidly, disease load and casualties are still on the rise, and crisis influence is spreading across developing countries. Around the globe, the reactions, perceptions, and outcomes were distinct. The outbreak has reflected unfavourable mental health impacts and symptoms. This pandemic has also affected the healthcare department that is treating the patients suffering from diseases other than corona. The power and severity of slowdown varying from being temporary to a long-term recession, they are unanimous about the fact that the slowdown would have an intense impact amongst various sectors of the economy. Most importantly, some panic among consumers and firms has disfigured standard patterns of consumption and caused market inconsistency. This article would give the overall idea of how the social, economic, cultural, and psychological aspects influenced by the pandemic. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

COVID-19 was first reported in Indonesia on March 03, 2020 then rapidly spread to all 34 provinces by April 09, 2020. Since then, COVID-19 is declared a state of national disaster and health emergency. This research analyzes the difference of CO, HCHO, NO2, and SO2 density in Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi before and during the pandemic. Also, this study assesses the effect of large scale restrictions on the economic growth during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. In a nutshell, the results on Wilcoxon and Fisher test by significance level α=5% as well as odds ratio showed that there are significant differences of CO density in all regions with highest odds ratio in East Java (OR=9.07), significant differences of HCHO density in DKI Jakarta, East Java, and South Sulawesi. There are significant differences of NO2 density before and during public activities limitation in DKI Jakarta, West Java, East Java, and South Sulawesi. However, the results show that there are no significant differences of SO2 density in all regions. In addition, this research shows that there are significant differences of retail, grocery and pharmacy, and residental mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This research also shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic there are severe economic losses, industry, companies, and real disruptions are severe for all levels of life due to large scale restrictions. © 2020 GJESM.

It is justified that this crisis did not originate in the economy itself but that it is the result of the inability of modern medicine to cope with the coronavirus. Therefore, in this case, the economy is a hostage to medicine. It is shown that the coronomic crisis differs from those economic crises that also occurred in the twentieth century for non-economic reasons. In the post-crisis period, the problem of reducing the budget deficit will be especially acute for almost all countries. Apparently, central banks, especially in import-dependent countries, will have to abandon the inflation targeting regime. Particular attention is paid to the problem of the zombie-ing of the economy with anti-crisis methods of supporting companies that had to reduce or completely suspend their economic activity. One of the challenges of the post-crisis period will be such a change in bankruptcy legislation that will help to get rid of the economy of zombie-firms and zombie-banks. © 2020 Bull. Georg. Natl.

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its impact on the global economy. In drawing things to a close, we explore the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G, among others, to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak. © 2013 IEEE. 5G; AI; Blockchain; Coronavirus; COVID-19; global economic impact; IoMT applications; IoT; pandemic; transmission stages; UAVs for disaster management 5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Blockchain; Drones; Coronaviruses; Global economies; Health implications; Health-care system; Internet of thing (IOT); World Health Organization; Internet of things COVID-19 and the importance of space in entrepreneurship research and policy Given the COVID-19 crisis, the importance of space in the global economic system has emerged as critical in a hitherto unprecedented way. Even as large-scale, globally operating digital platform enterprises find new ways to thrive in the midst of a crisis, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) nestled in local economies have proven to be fragile to shocks, causing countless local economies to unravel in the face of severe challenges to survival. Here, we discuss the role of entrepreneurship in re-building local economies that are more resilient. Specifically, we take a spatial perspective and highlight how the COVID-19 crisis has uncovered problems in the current tendency for thin contextualisation and promotion of globalisation. Based on this critique, we outline new perspectives for thinking about the relationship between entrepreneurship, resilience and local economies. Here, a particular emphasis is given to resilience building through deeply contextualised policies and research, localised flows of products and labour, and the diversification of local economies. © The Author(s) 2020.

Millions of employees have lost their jobs and are facing financial hardships. Likewise, capital owners have become illiquid and possibly insolvent within months. This cycle seems to continue for other factors of production as well. Even after lifting quarantines, the global trade might take months (years) to return to its actual potential. Using the GTAP-VA model, the present study simulates the impact of the double-hit scenario of Covid-19 on the global value chains and identifies production losses in different sectors of the world economy. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V. Covid-19; Economy; Global value chains  COVID-19: Progress in diagnostics, therapy and vaccination Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently become a pandemic. As the sudden emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is endangering global health and the economy, the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. At present, various diagnostic kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 are available for use to initiate appropriate treatment faster and to limit further spread of the virus. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 or potential clinical benefits. In addition, institutions and companies worldwide are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines against COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine has yet been specifically approved for COVID-19. Given the urgency of the outbreak, we focus here on recent advances in the diagnostics, treatment, and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to guide strategies to address the current COVID-19 pandemic. © The author(s).

As our knowledge of the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the symptomatology and management of COVID-19 expands, orthopedic surgeons must remain up to date on the latest medical evidence and surgical perspectives. While COVID-19 primarily manifests with pulmonary symptoms, cardiovascular, neurologic, and other major organ systems may also be affected and present with hallmark imaging findings.

Such public safety infectious disease includes influences great pressure on the national economy. At present, some countries and regions in the world are still in epidemic situation, and there is an urgent need to judge the infection situation and travel risk in the region. In a relatively fine scale down to perceive the surrounding situation, and then rational zoning decisions to promote the resumption of production and work. In this study, indicators for the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic were constructed using multi-sourced data. A computational evaluation of 736 fine-grained grids was performed using the GeoDetector model and the decision tree model. The study found that the risk level in older neighborhoods was much higher than in newer neighborhoods; the population density was the most important determinant of infection; the number of urban people slumped to 37% of that in usual times according to Tencent data after the 'city closure'; The model this paper used portrays the major factor in defining low-risk areas and high-risk areas, and offers suggestions and assessment from a geographical perspective to fight COVID-19, thus presenting great practical value. © 2013 IEEE.

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial task, as it reduces the risk of pandemic spread, and early treatment will save patients' life. Due to the time-consuming, complex nature, and high false-negative rate of the gold-standard RT-PCR test used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the need for an additional diagnosis method has increased. Studies have proved the significance of X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The dissemination of deep-learning techniques on X-ray images can automate the diagnosis process and serve as an assistive tool for radiologists. In this study, we used four deep-learning models-DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19-using the transfer-learning concept for the diagnosis of X-ray images as COVID-19 or normal. In the proposed study, VGG16 and VGG19 outperformed the other two deep-learning models. The study achieved an overall classification accuracy of 99.3%. © 2020 by the authors.

Different efforts are ongoing on the development of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 treatment. However, the leading strategy to curtail the spread of the dis-eases has been various control measures which aim at breaking the chain of COVID-19 spread. In this work, we investigate the impact of government control measures and immune system strength on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Discrete delays are used to describe the restriction in social contacts due to government orders and the delay in infection manifestation due to immune response. The qualitative analysis of COVID-19 pandemic steady-state predict a stable state if COVID-19 latent period is negative and unstable state when the latent period is positive. The inclusion of delay in social contacts stabilizes the unstable pandemic steady-state when the infection is symptomatic and unstable when the infection is asymptomatic. Optimal strategy to flatten COVID-19 pandemic curve using social distance is also recommended. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.. All rights reserved.

This article considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gig economy sector, in particular on the work of bicycle couriers in Poland. The main research question is whether in this case the impact is positive (it is a ‘good’ occupation during the pandemic) or negative (gig economy has suffered the consequences of the lockdown just like all other sectors). In order to answer this question, I conducted 20 semi-structured online interviews with Glovo couriers in March and April 2020 and analysed 1300 posts on their internet forum. The analysis of the research material makes it possible to conclude that in the period of the pandemic and the lockdown of the Polish economy, working as a courier was at least a partial ‘remedy’ for the problems on the labour market. The couriers themselves generally did not feel the negative impact of the coronavirus on their occupational situation. © 2020 European Sociological Association.

As on date, around 8.20 million confirmed cases including death of around 443,815 have been reported. The present review deals with the history and origin of the COVID-19, its worldwide pandemic spread, symptoms and preventive measures as an attempt to create awareness of the fatal disease. © 2020 Deuton-X Ltd.

Corona; COVID-19; Global pandemic; Virus  COVID-19: Combined supply-side and demand-side shocks, so lift restrictions (carefully) lest GPD declines ultimately kill more than COVID-19 COVID-19 remains pandemic. Social distancing and travel restrictions have avoided countless deaths and infections but disrupted livelihoods and economies. The global loss of gross (world) product is unprecedented as COVID-19 has inflicted both a supply-side and a demand-side shock. While public health measures have mitigated morbidity and mortality, the excessive loss of GDP will lead to years of life lost due to recession with diminished spend on healthcare, safety and the environment. This paper will review the estimated COVID-19 economic impact and show that it is timely and crucial to (carefully) ease restrictions as any additional economic slide will continue to intensify an already parlous situation and further negatively impact overall global average human life expectancy. The USA and UK will be used as specific examples, as will the general case of delayed cancer treatment due to COVID-19 service disruption. Financial stimuli that attempt to revive flagging economies by governments and blocs will be outlined and the current uniformly bleak global forecasts will be briefly contrasted with the Great Depression of the 1930s. The biased adverse impact on low-income households will be sketched, and a reminder of the unknown eventual costs of lasting illness (“long COVID”) will also have to be factored in restriction removal policies. At this point in time (end of summer 2020), fierce debates rage within each country regarding the potential trade-offs of health vs economy. The need for unbiased and rigorous quantitative evaluations of all possible decisions is paramount. © 2020 COVID-19; Depression; Economics; Health economics; Recession  The underlying factors of the COVID-19 spatially uneven spread. Initial evidence from regions in nine EU countries The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was brought to the global spotlight in early 2020 and has already had significant impacts on daily life, while the effects could last for a long period. However, these impacts appear to have been regionally differentiated, since similar to previous pandemics, geography plays an important role in viruses' diffusion. This paper enriches our knowledge about the initial territorial impact of the pandemic, from January to May 2020, studying the spread of COVID-19 across 119 regional economies in nine EU countries and explaining its underlying factors. Air quality, demographics, global interconnectedness, urbanization trends, historic trends in health expenditure as well as the policies implemented to mitigate the pandemic were found to have influenced the regionally uneven mortality rate of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

It is regarded as one of the worst pandemics, which has consumed both human lives and the world economy. COVID-19 infection mainly affects the lungs triggering severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, also providing a nidus for superimposed bacterial and fungal infections. We report the case of a 73-year-old male who presented with progressive dyspnea; diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2–related severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and complicated with lung cavitations growing Aspergillus sp. COVID-19, to our knowledge, has rarely been associated with subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with aspergillomas. Subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis as a superimposed infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 is a rare entity. By reporting this case, we would like to make the readers aware of this association. © 2020 American Federation for Medical Research. acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19; infection; pulmonary aspergillosis; SARS-CoV-2  Analytical Methods on Determination in Pharmaceuticals and Biological Materials of Chloroquine as Available for the Treatment of COVID-19 With the outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COVID-19), people’s health and existing economies on a global scale are seriously threatened. Currently, most of the countries all over the world are studying extensively to better understand the antimalarial chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for therapeutic purposes due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, CQ and HCQ can have serious side effects, from psychiatric effects to sudden death. Therefore, a faster and more effective detection method is needed to monitor drug concentrations. In this review, a large study was conducted on the detection techniques and quantitative determination methods of CQ and its related metabolites. In this review, chromatography, electrophoresis, electroanalytical, spectroscopic, and immunological methods for CQ and related metabolites are discussed extensively. It is hoped that a better understanding of the CQ used for therapeutic purposes in the COVID-19 outbreak will be provided. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Nearly 2/3rd of the global burden of sickle cell disease (SCD) is found to be in sub-Saharan Africa. There is increased mortality risk in sickle cell disease patients in Africa due to associated complications such as acute chest syndrome, asthma, pulmonary emboli and sepsis. Sickle cell disease management is the major contributor of financial burden on the government. Moreover, there is a shortage of medical specialists in Africa. COVID-19 pandemic has further led to devastating impact on economy and health globally. The chances of SCD patient contracting COVID-19 infections are higher as these patients are immunocompromised and may be at a higher risk of mortality. Practicing preventive measures including isolation and social distancing by these patients will prevent mortality rates as well as economic burden on government in the present unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. © Nitin Ashok John et al.

In addition to the risk of health problems, this pandemic has also disrupted the global economy. The exchange rate of Rupiah also devalued during the COVID 19 outbreak. The interventions from the government to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have impacted the Rupiah exchange rate too. This study tries to use the most appropriate forecasting method to predict further values of the Rupiah exchange rate. The aim of this research is to look for the most useful method of predicting the Rupiah exchange rate, which can be used to capture various data patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The methods that will be involved in this research are Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), NNAR (Neural Network Auto-Regressive), Extreme Learning Machine, and Support Vector Machine. The result is that the LSTM model is the best prediction method for predicting an exchange rate from Rupiah that can allow long-term dependency. This model shows that although there were no COVID-19 events based on the model formed, it was predicted that the rupiah would decline in value against the US dollar. The COVID-19 case made the depreciation of the rupiah currency far greater than predicted. The declining growth of Covid-19 cases in Indonesia, accompanied by the Indonesian government's policy on large-scale social restrictions (Bahasa: PSBB), appears to have managed to increase the value of the rupiah against the US dollar. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

Data on the effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 remain limited. Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcomes data of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to 7 March 2020, were collected. Binary logistic regression model was used to analyse risk factors for disease progression from severe COVID-19 illness to critical illness. The effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 disease were evaluated. Results: The results of the multivariate analysis from 175 patients with severe COVID-19 indicate that the use of methylprednisolone was a protective factor against disease progression from severe to critical illness(P &lt;.001; OR: 0.054 95% CI: 0.017-0.173). Among patients with severe COVID-19 aged &lt; 65 years, both the proportion of patients who progressed to critical illness (42.2% vs 90.0%, P =.000) and the mortality(6.7% vs 30.0%, P =.002) were lower for patients in methylprednisolone group, compared with those in the non-methylprednisolone group, whereas no statistical differences between the methylprednisolone group and the non-methylprednisolone group were found among patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years. Moreover, both the levels of CD4+ T lymphocyte counts (646 vs 463/µL, P =.007) and IL-6 (241.9 vs 82.8 pg/mL, P =.025) were higher among patients with severe COVID-19 aged &lt; 65 years, compared with those patients ≥ 65 years old. Conclusion: Data from the limited sample showed that the early use of low or medium doses of methylprednisolone has a positive effect for patients with severe COVID-19 younger than 65 years old, and excessive immune response and cytokine storm may be some of the reasons for the effectiveness. © 2020 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation COVID-19; cytokine storm; methylprednisolone; prognosis; SARS-CoV-2  Covid-19: Current knowledge, disease potential, prevention and clinical advances The top priority of any nation is to lead the nation towards prosperity, progress, and economic growth, confronting several challenges and concerns arisen from global situations. The sudden outbreak of any disease defies the health care systems and economy of nations. COVID-19 is one of the viral diseases which broke out in Wuhan city of China in 2019. COVID-19 outbreak intermittently prevailed all over the world. It exposes the fragility of the established health care systems across the world in spite of comprising modern science and technology. Unfortunately, there is no chemotherapeutic agent in the regimen of antiviral drugs or no vaccine available to curb this infectious disease. As a consequence, this deadly infection has prevailed all over the world. The antiviral drugs used for viral diseases excluding COVID-19 infection are Ramdesvir, Favipiravir, and Ribavarin, and antimalarial agents (Chloroquine & Hydroxychloroquine) are being administered to the patients for redemption of this infection. Fortunately, these existing drugs have been found clinically active and are being used. In this review, we present the current scenario and status of epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, vaccine development for COVID-19, and its impact on the socio-economic structure. © TÜBİTAK.

This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH COVID-19; MERS; SARS; spike protein; vaccine candidate; vaccine development  Network analysis of global stock markets at the beginning of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak The Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has become one of the biggest threats to the global economy and financial markets. This study aims to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on 56 global stock indices from October 15, 2019 to August 7, 2020 by using a complex network method. Furthermore, the change of the network structure is analyzed in depth by dividing the stock markets into developed, emerging and frontier markets. The findings reveal a structural change in the form of node changes, reduced connectivity and significant differences in the topological characteristics of the network, due to COVID-19. A contagion effect is also identified in the network structure of emerging markets, with the nodes behaving synchronously. The findings also reveal substantial clustering and homogeneity in the world stock market network, based on geographic positioning. Besides, the number of positive correlations in the global stock indices increased during the outbreak. The stock markets of France and Germany seem to be the most relevant developed markets, while Taiwan and Slovenia have this relevance in emerging and frontier markets. The findings of this study help regulators and practitioners to design important strategies in the light of varying stock market dynamics during COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Minimum spanning tree; Network; Network topology; Stock markets  Influencers and COVID-19: reviewing key issues in press coverage across Australia, China, Japan, and South Korea As COVID-19 broke out across the Asia Pacific from December 2019, media coverage on its impacts proliferated online. Among these discourses, coverage on influencers was prominent, likely as many of the issues arising from COVID-19 contingencies – such as digitalization, public messaging, and misinformation – are cornerstones of this digital economy. In response, this cross-cultural study draws on a corpus of Australian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean online news articles published between January and May 2020, to understand how local news ecologies were parsing the impacts of COVID-19 on influencers. From the coding of 150 news articles guided by Grounded Theory, this article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on influencers, and influencers’ engagements with and reactions to the pandemic. Our study of individual governments’ past engagements with their influencer industries suggest that local backstories and contexts are crucial to decipher why news angles tend to pitch particular stories on influencers. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus; COVID-19; influencers; press coverage; social media; wanghong  Deep learning based detection and analysis of COVID-19 on chest X-ray images Covid-19 is a rapidly spreading viral disease that infects not only humans, but animals are also infected because of this disease. The daily life of human beings, their health, and the economy of a country are affected due to this deadly viral disease. Covid-19 is a common spreading disease, and till now, not a single country can prepare a vaccine for COVID-19. A clinical study of COVID-19 infected patients has shown that these types of patients are mostly infected from a lung infection after coming in contact with this disease. Chest x-ray (i.e., radiography) and chest CT are a more effective imaging technique for diagnosing lunge related problems. Still, a substantial chest x-ray is a lower cost process in comparison to chest CT. Deep learning is the most successful technique of machine learning, which provides useful analysis to study a large amount of chest x-ray images that can critically impact on screening of Covid-19. In this work, we have taken the PA view of chest x-ray scans for covid-19 affected patients as well as healthy patients. After cleaning up the images and applying data augmentation, we have used deep learning-based CNN models and compared their performance. We have compared Inception V3, Xception, and ResNeXt models and examined their accuracy. To analyze the model performance, 6432 chest x-ray scans samples have been collected from the Kaggle repository, out of which 5467 were used for training and 965 for validation. In result analysis, the Xception model gives the highest accuracy (i.e., 97.97%) for detecting Chest X-rays images as compared to other models. This work only focuses on possible methods of classifying covid-19 infected patients and does not claim any medical accuracy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Currently, the World Health Organization has declared SARS-CoV-2 (more commonly known as COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern. It is projected that the path of COVID-19 could kill 50–80 million people and impacts the world’s economy in its devastating global sweep. The surge is increasing on global and national levels, causing rapid loss of life, joblessness, deterioration of the healthcare systems, and both national and global economies. In Ethiopia, the first COVID-19 case was reported in March. Since then, the government has been taking different measures to prevent its spread. Locking down all schools, declared social distancing and hand hygiene, and restricting large gatherings were some of the Ethiopian government’s actions. Objective: To determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 pandemic among quarantined adults in Tigrai region, Ethiopia. Methods: A total of 331 participants selected using a systematic random sampling method were included in the study. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire. After describing the variables using frequencies, means, and standard deviations, multivariable logistic regression determined factors associated with knowledge and chi-squared tests for attitudes and practices towards COVID-19. Results: The study participants were primarily males (70%) and mean age 30.5 (SD=11) years. The mean knowledge score was 8.73 (SD=2.64), with less than half 42.9% (95% CI: 37.5–48%) of the study participants were knowledgeable. Regarding the attitude questions, three-fourths of the participants believed that Ethiopia will control and win the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly one-third of the participants replied that the Ethiopian government is handling this pandemic health crisis well. About half of the study participants reported that they had gone to crowded places in recent days, did not wear face mask when leaving home, and practiced preventive measures given by local health authorities. Knowledge score was statistically significantly associated with gender, age, and educational status of the study participants, whereas attitude and practices were significantly associated with educational status and knowledge of participants. © 2020 Haftom et al.

We performed partial correlation analysis and linear mixed effect modelling to evaluate the association of the spread rate and motility of COVID-19 with maximum, minimum, average temperatures and diurnal temperature variation (difference between daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperature) and other environmental and socio-economic parameters. After controlling the effect of the duration since the first positive case, partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was not related with the spatial variability of the spread rate of COVID-19 at the global scale. Mortality was negatively related with temperature in the countries with high-income economies. In contrast, diurnal temperature variation was significantly and positively correlated with mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Taking the country heterogeneity into account, mixed effect modelling revealed that inclusion of temperature as a fixed factor in the model significantly improved model skill predicting mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis suggests that warm climate may reduce the mortality rate in high-income economies, but in low- and middle-income countries, high diurnal temperature variation may increase the mortality risk. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; DEMATEL; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Lockdown; Pandemic; Relaxed measures  Why has COVID-19 not hit the countries like Nepal yet? Noble CORONA Virus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease similar form of pneumonia/SARS-CoV-2-impacting globally. The fear of coronavirus looks pandemic, but its severity is uncertain. Nepal was one of the first nine countries outside of China to report a COVID-19 case. Also, its unpredictability of mode or range of surface, the lifespan of the virus, objects of transmission (a distance of air/air currents, living duration in air, humidity, duration on objects, surface). The first case was found in Wuhan in December 2019 in China. The purpose is to summarize the current information about COVID-19 and to explore in terms of why Nepal is not hitting severely, while other countries are on death toll? We summarized the published articles form the web sources and news, Academic Journals, Ministry of health and population Nepal, WHO/CDC update reports/guidelines, Google search engine. Thematic analysis is made to explore the situation. Although, Nepal has a lack of health services, testing kits, advance lab and protecting equipment (PPE), why COVID-19 does not hit Nepal than China, Europe and North America, it still tremendous uncertainty. Is lockdown, isolation, social distance and quarantine the best ways of prevention? The hypothesis is floating globally-do BCG vaccinated countries are safer than non-user OR due to not having enough kits to screen populations at risk for the virus-while lack of testing a big cause for missing case OR Nepalese have better immune systems? It has attracted global attention. We believe that the COVID-19 is still evolving and it is too early to predict of an outbreak in Nepal. The government needs to increase funding for local health departments, begin planning for future epidemics and be prepared to bolster the economy by supporting consumer spending the midst of a serious outbreak. COVID-19 is a serious health challenge for Nepal, but so far the number of death has been lower than was foretell. It is, therefore essential to carry out more scientific evidence to explore results. Nepalese health services need to maintain up than today and follow lockdown, isolation, social distance and an advance screening test kit through the country. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020.

It is not always limited to just paid employment. Occupations of the global population have been adversely affected in one way or the other because of this COVID-19 pandemic. Four different key sects of occupations were majorly affected. These are the occupations of those who are or were COVID-positive, occupations of healthy individuals affected by COVID-19/lockdown, occupations of the population highly susceptible and vulnerable of contracting COVID-19 and occupations having a direct impact on global market, supply chain or economy. These occupations were locked up due to the pandemic lockdown. Occupational therapists can scientifically analyse occupations and help formulate exit strategies for the lockdown. They are experts who understand and study the different ways of measuring participation in occupation to develop innovative strategies and therapeutic interventions to facilitate individuals' engagement in occupations. They can unravel the pragmatic strategies for preventing transmission (physical distancing, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment usage and decontamination) despite engaging in occupations safely and effectively. Nourishing this niche and essential science is pertinent, not just in this pandemic context but also against a backdrop of health and social care research, policy, practice and education for the future. © 2020 Kamalakannan S and Chakraborty S.

The spread started at the end of January 2020, and different countries used different approaches in terms of testing, sanitization, lock down and quarantine centres to control the spread of the virus. People are getting back to working and routine life activities with new normal standards of testing, sanitization, social distancing and lock down. People are regularly tested to identify those who are infected with COVID-19 and isolate them from general public. However, testing all people unnecessarily is an expensive operation in terms of resources usage. There must be an optimal policy to test only those who have higher chances of being COVID-19 positive. Similarly, sanitization is used for individuals and streets to disinfect people and places. However, sanitization is also an expensive operation in terms of resources, and it is not possible to disinfect each and every individual and street. Social separating or lock down or quarantine centres focuses are different methodologies that are utilised to control the human-to-human transmission of the infection and separate the individuals who are contaminated with COVID-19. However, lock down and quarantine centres are expensive operations in terms of resources as it disturbs the affairs of state and the growth of economy. At the same time, it negatively affects the quality of life of a society. It is also not possible to provide resources to all citizens by locking them inside homes or quarantine centres for infinite time. All these parameters are expensive in terms of resources and have an effect on controlling the spread of the virus, quality of life of human, resources and economy. In this article, a novel intelligent method based on reinforcement learning (RL) is built up that quantifies the unique levels of testing, disinfection and lock down alongside its impact on the spread of the infection, personal satisfaction or quality of life, resource use and economy. Different RL algorithms are actualized and agents are prepared with these algorithms to interact with the environment to gain proficiency with the best strategy. The examinations exhibit that deep learning–based algorithms, for example, DQN and DDPG are performing better than customary RL algorithms, for example, Q-Learning and SARSA. © The Author(s) 2020.

Forced emergence to find an effective vaccine to immunize people has led scientists to design and examine vaccine candidates all over the world. Until a vaccine is developed, however, effective treatment is needed to combat this virus, which is resistant to all conventional antiviral drugs. Accordingly, more about the structure, entry mechanism, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 is required. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the gateway to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, so our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 can help us to complete its mechanism of interaction with ACE2 and virus endocytosis, which can be interrupted by neutralizing small molecules or proteins. ACE2 also plays a crucial role in lung injury. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC ACE2; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ARDS; COVID-19; miRNA; SARS-CoV-2  Setback in labour market integration due to the Covid-19 crisis? An explorative insight on forced migrants’ vulnerability in Germany In Germany as elsewhere, the Covid-19 pandemic has provoked a severe crisis for the economy, the labour market, social life and public administration. This article explores how refugees, who have accessed the labour market prior to the crisis, are affected by the current situation. Focusing on the crisis-shaken labour market as a juncture for integration processes, we were interested in whether the crisis actually increases vulnerability and leads to setbacks in integration processes. Based on qualitative interviews with refugees and employers conducted at the beginning of the crisis, the article identifies three problem areas in the field of working life (every day working life, conditions of work, prospects and the advancement of careers) in which the crisis-induced disruptions produced feelings of disorientation and made some refugees vulnerable. This went hand in hand with irritations in adaptation processes that are crucial for integration. The findings suggest that the Covid-19 crisis could, for some, turn into a ‘critical event’ in entire integration trajectories. © 2020 European Sociological Association.

Regardless of the strength of health care infrastructure across different economies, all countries are diverting their resources toward care for COVID-19 patients. Aim: The aim of this survey was to evaluate the pattern of care of gynaecologic cancers in a developing country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An anonymous survey consisting of 20 questions intended for the gynaecologic cancer care providers with emphasis on their current practice and approach to their patients was distributed online via social media from April 30 to May 31, 2020. Basic descriptive statistics were applied. Results: Among a total of 61 respondents, 63.9% were gynaecologic oncologists, 18.0% were radiation oncologists and 18.0% were medical oncologists. Majority, that is, 95.1% health care professionals felt that COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant change on their practice pattern and 56.2% practitioners had stopped registering new cases of cancer. In 75.4% centers surgery was being done for gynaecologic cancer cases and among them 60.8% were doing surgery only for cases requiring immediate intervention. Among the centers providing chemotherapy, 39.1% had switched to oral drugs. Among the centers providing radiation, 40.9% were providing radiation to cases based on their type and urgency and 9.0% had implemented hypofractionation. In early stage low risk cases, majority, that is, 34.0% centers were managing as before. In early stage high-risk cases, 32.6% centers were managing as before. In advanced stage endometrial cancer cases, 28.8% had postponed any treatment and 28.8% administered chemotherapy. In early stage, epithelial ovarian cancer 65.9% centers were performing complete staging of the disease. In advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer, 65.9% centers preferred biopsy followed by neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 11.3% centers performed primary debulking surgery. In cases of interval debulking surgery, 73.3% centers deferred surgery till all six cycles of chemotherapy was completed. In cases of recurrent ovarian cancer amenable for secondary debulking surgery, 38.6% preferred chemotherapy. In early stage cervical cancer, surgical treatment was provided in 46.5% centers. In locally advanced cervical cancer, chemoradiation was given in 65.9% centers. In cases of metastatic cervical cancer, 46.6% centers were performing palliative radiation. Conclusion: COVID-19 has affected the treatment of gynecologic cancers patients and health care professionals are trying to mitigate the damage by incorporating new elements which are suited to the current scenario. © 2020 The Author.

Therefore, firms are now trying to identify the ways for enhancing survivability of Sustainable Supply Chains (SSCs). This study has made an effort to develop a framework for enhancing survivability of SSCs to survive in and post-COVID-19 pandemic. This study has utilised Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method for identifying the significant factors for enhancing survivability of SSCs to be focused in pandemic situation. The study revealed that ‘Supply Chain Network Viability (SCV)’ is the main criterion for managing buyer–supplier relationship and enhancing survivability of SSCs during and post-COVID-19 situation. This study is helpful for firms, suppliers, and other stakeholders to focus on the identified factors for healthier future. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. buyer–supplier relationship; COVID-19 pandemic; digital data-driven SCs; survivability; Sustainable supply chains (SSCs); viability  Preliminary findings of the impact of COVID-19 on drugs crypto markets Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented consequences on the world economy. The impact of the pandemic on illicit drug market remains scant. We expose the potential consequences the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the ability of people who use drugs to source their illicit drugs via cryptomarkets. Methods: We analyzed 262 self-reported submissions of illicit drug transactions on the darkweb. The self-reports include the date of the transaction, the types of illicit drugs bought/sold, and whether the shipment of the illicit drugs succeeded, had issues (ex. unusually long delivery, an error in the type of drug shipped, quantity or concentration of the drug), or failed. Results: Between January 1st, 2020 and March 21, 2020, successful deliveries represented 60% to 100% of transactions. Starting on March 21 however, the share of shipments that had issues or failed increased rapidly and represented a majority of all shipments. At the peak of the market disruption, the successful deliveries represented only 21% of all transactions. Conclusion: Illicit drug transactions on the darkweb were disrupted at the same time as lockdowns were put in place in the United States and in the United Kingdom. While no causation link can be established, the correlation suggests that lockdowns could have disrupted drug cryptomarkets activities. We discuss the market disruption in light of the literature. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Considering this, a proper understanding of serologic-based diagnostic testing characteristics is critical. The aim of this study was to perform a structured systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic characteristics of serological-based COVID-19 testing. Electronic searches were performed using Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Full-text observational studies that reported IgG or IgM diagnostic yield and used nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) of respiratory tract specimens, as a the reference standard in English language were included. A bivariate model was used to compute pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio (LR), diagnostic odds ratio (OR), and summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Five studies (n=1,166 individual tests) met inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for IgG was 81% [(95% CI, 61-92);I2=95.28], 97% [(95% CI, 78-100);I2=97.80], and 93% (95% CI, 91-95), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for IgM antibodies was 80% [(95% CI, 57-92);I2=94.63], 96% [(95% CI, 81-99);I2=92.96] and 95% (95% CI, 92-96). This meta-analysis demonstrates suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of serologic-based diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 and suggests that antibody testing alone, in its current form, is unlikely to be an adequate solution to the difficulties posed by COVID-19 and in guiding future policy decisions regarding social distancing and reopening of the economy worldwide. © 2020 CLINICS.

Due to strict lockdown, the manufacturing and logistics activities have been suspended, and it has affected the demand and supply of various products as a result of restrictions imposed on shopkeepers and retailers. Impacts of COVID-19 are observed ubiquitously in every type of units from different sectors. In this study, a simulation model of the public distribution system (PDS) network is developed with three different scenarios to demonstrate disruptions in the food supply chain. Difficulties have been increased in matching supply and demand in a vast network of PDS because of changing scenarios with the growth of infected cases and recovery. This paper also highlights the importance of a resilient supply chain during a pandemic. Our proposed simulation model can help in developing a resilient and responsive food supply chain to match the varying demand, and then further assist in providing decision-making support for rerouting the vehicles as per travel restrictions in areas. Paper has been summarised with significant highlights and including future research scope for developing a more robust food supply chain network. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

There is hardly a country in the world that is not currently facing this problem. The number of cases is constantly growing, patients and carriers being the main mode of transmission. The economies of all countries are at stake. However, people need essential goods and food, regardless of the situation. In this respect, agriculture, food industry, food market, and catering have become priority industries. A continuous operation of food service enterprises (FSE) is crucial for the uninterrupted food supply in the period of preventive measures. The paper describes how pathogen makes its way into FSEs, spreads, and infects people. This information makes it possible to assess the probability of coronavirus infection and to reduce its spread, thus ensuring the safe operation of the enterprise. There are three transmission routes the coronavirus can take at a FSE: (1) aerial transmission by droplets and aerosols during the main and secondary technological production processes, (2) person-to-person transmission from clients to staff or from employee to employee via direct or indirect contact, (3) transmission via contaminated surfaces, e.g. packaging, furniture, equipment, etc. FSEs have to follow the recommendations published by the federal and/or local authorities, which may vary depending on the COVID-19 incidence rate in the area. These recommendations are based on the probability of the public health risk associated with person-to-person transmission, rather than on food safety. © 2020, Mayurnikova et al.

It covers around 99.7% of all enterprises operated in Japan and employs around 70% of the working population and account for a large portion of economic output. But, like other SMEs in the world, they also the ones that have hardly hit by COVID-19 quarantine and business closures. Japanese government made emergency loans and credit guarantee to assist SMEs. However, moral hazard problems of banks and SMEs have to be remedied. In the capital market, many investors take risk-averse behavior to anticipate further measures. Infrastructure investments are most needed in Asian region yet finance for infrastructure investments would face with shortage of funds due to low rate of return and risks. Private financing by long term investors such as pension funds and insurance better be directed to support infrastructure investment. Spillover tax revenues could be partly directed to increase the rate of return. The Japanese economy faces with aging population which would widen fiscal deficits unless postponement of retirement age and productivity-based wage rate rather than seniority wage rate facing with this crisis. Therefore, Japan government need to look into innovative policies options for sustainable economic growth. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston. carbon tax; COVID-19; infrastructure projects; policy recommendations; SME  Covid-19 pandemic in Japan: Containment failed or successful? [A pandemia da COVID-19 no Japão: Contenção fracassada ou bemsucedida?] [La pandemia de COVID-19 en Japón: ¿contención fallida o exitosa?] This short article examines key governmental measures against the spread of COVID-19 in Japan from a geopolitical perspective. “Geopolitical” in this article means to see the measures as spatial strategies. At the stage of globalized pandemic, state territoriality or border control is no longer able to effectively control the spread of the virus. Instead, this article argues, multi-scalar intergovernmental coordination is inevitable to tackle the virus moving along increasing trans-border/local human flows. Using the case of Japan, this article overviews how effective social distancing as a spatial strategy has been and illustrates how the limits to such a strategy to control human behavior can affect anti-virus measures. In conclusion, this article argues that the effective devolution of state power to local governments and the strengthening of state supplementary function to sustain local healthcare system and economy would be more desirable than the authoritative concentration of state power in the state of emergency. © 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Containment; COVID-19 pandemic; Intergovernmental coordination; Japan; Territoriality  The Big Reveal: COVID-19 and Globalization's Great Transformations Analysis of the post-COVID world tends to gravitate to one of two poles. For some, the pandemic is a crisis that will reshuffle the decks, producing a fundamental reordering of global politics. For others, the basic principles of the international order are likely to remain much the same, driven largely by the emerging bipolar system between the US and China. We find both narratives dissatisfying, as the former overinterprets the causal role of the pandemic itself, while the latter underappreciates the critical ways in which global politics have been transformed beyond the state-centered system of the Cold War. We argue instead that the pandemic exposes underlying trends already at work and forces scholars to open the aperture on how we study globalization. Most centrally, we contend that globalization needs to be seen not just as a distributional game of winners and losers but rather a more profoundly transformational game that reshapes identities, redefines channels of power and authority, and generates new sites for contentious politics. We draw on emerging work to sketch out a theoretical frame for thinking about the politics of globalization, and assess some of the key policy arenas where COVID-19 is accelerating the transformative effects of globalization. In so doing, we suggest a roadmap to a post-pandemic research agenda for studying global markets that more fully captures these transformations and their implications for world politics.

This paper seeks to assess the credit climate from just before the unexpected global health crisis catalyst to its immediate and extended impact. We analyze the performance of several key indicators of the nature of credit cycles: default and recovery rates on high-yield bonds, and the number of large firm bankruptcies that we expect over the next twelve months and beyond; yield spreads and distress ratios; and liquidity. Our focus is primarily on the nonfi-nancial corporate debt market in the United States, which reached a record percent-age of gross domestic product at the end of 2019 as firms increased their debt to take advantage of record low interest rates, and investor appetite grew for higher promised yields on risky fixed-income assets. We also examine the leveraged loan and collater-alized loan obligation markets, as well as the increasingly large and important BBB tranche of the corporate bond market. Specifically, we discuss the latter’s vulnerabil-ity to downgrades over the expected downturn in the real economy and this vulnera-bility’s potential impact on expected default rates by “crowding out” low-quality debt of other firms (some of which we believe are “zombies”). Using Z-scores for a sample of BBB companies between 2007 and 2019, we analyze this largest component of the corporate bond market to provide some evidence on the controversial debate as to whether there has been ratings inflation or, perhaps, persistent overvaluation of the nonfinancial corporate debt market since the last financial crisis. © 2020 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.

The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions as well as the underlying economic policies behind the loans that IFIs are granting to States are studied, identifying clear signals that fiscal discipline and pro-market options will continue being the priorities as soon as the emergency has been overcome. The study explains how the adjustment and austerity policies implemented in the countries in the region have adversely and disproportionally affected women's rights, in particular reinforcing the invisibilization of gender inequalities in the domestic and care work and how this situation, in turn, has put women in a situation of greater vulnerability to the pandemic. It also criticizes the (self)called ""gender approach"" of IFIs for being merely instrumental to economic growth without consideration to the intrinsic value of gender equality and women's rights. The responsibility of IFIs for complicity with economic reforms with known adverse effects on gender equality is studied. Given the policy and legal implications of the findings presented in this research, the article concludes that States in the region should consider carefully the conditions of the loans being offered by IFIs, for which it is crucial to conduct ex ante evaluations of the impact of these financial contacts on the human rights of the population, and in particular on gender equality. © Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

The stock market information of the top 32 coronavirus affected economies (as of 31st March 2020) was sampled for ex-ante and ex-post COVID-19 outbreak analysis using the Detrended Moving Cross-Correlation Analysis (DMCA) and Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) techniques. The results confirm a fractal contagion effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock markets. Furthermore, this fractal contagion effect fizzles out over time (in the middle and long run) for both the stock markets return and volatility. Therefore, this article provides pieces of evidence for the COVID-19 fractal contagion effect on the stock markets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Due to economic pressure, the government of India had to implement a policy of relaxing control during the rising period of the epidemic. This paper proposes a compartment model to study the development of COVID-19 in India after relaxing control. The Sigmoid function reflecting the cumulative effect is used to characterize the model-based diagnosis rate, cure rate and mortality rate. Considering the influence of the lockdown on the model parameters, the data are fitted using the method of least squares before and after the lockdown. According to numerical simulation and model analysis, the impact of India’s relaxation of control before and after the inflection point is studied. Research shows that adopting a relaxation policy prematurely will have disastrous consequences. Even if the degree of relaxation is only 5% before the inflection point, it will increase the number of deaths by 15.03%. If the control is relaxed after the inflection point, the higher degree of relaxation, the more likely a secondary outbreak will occur, which will extend the duration of the pandemic, leading to more deaths and put more pressure on the health care system. It is found that after the implementation of the relaxation policy, medical quarantine capability and public cooperation are two vital indicators. The results show that if the supply of kits and detection speed can be increased after the control is relaxed, the secondary outbreak can be effectively avoided. Meanwhile, the increase in public cooperation can significantly reduce the spread of the virus, suppress the second outbreak of the pandemic and reduce the death toll. It is of reference significance to the government’s policy formulation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics have been partially described in some observational studies. Not enough systematic reviews on predictors of critical illness and mortality in COVID 19 have been published to date. In this review, we had illustrated the prognostic predictors of COVID-19 by gathering published information on the risk factors related to the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. © 2020 Aly et al.

This report highlights potential risks faced by their agri-food sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic and outlines the responses and policy actions each member is taking to address threats to food security and prevent hunger. Research Method: Publicly available information was synthesized, and insights from 19 individuals working in agriculture or agri-food-related areas in the public or private sectors or academia in APO member countries were obtained. Findings: Imminent, medium-and long-term food security challenges due to COVID-19 vary among APO member countries. However, through the implementation of key policies, many stress the need for critical agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and safe, quality seeds, to meet seasonal crop calendars. The longer COVID-19 containment measures stay in place, the more challenging the recovery process will be for ensuring smooth food production, accessibility to staple food and nutrition and trade among countries. Originality / Value: Provides consolidated insight into policies and actions taken by APO member economies to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on food security and the agri-food sector. © 2020, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel-data regression models to evaluate the influence of the daily increase in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases during pre-lockdown and lockdown on daily stock returns of 723 listed firms in Vietnam from 30 January to 30 May 2020. Findings: The study confirms the adverse impact of the daily increasing number of COVID-19 cases on stock returns in Vietnam. The study also discloses that the Vietnam stock market before and during the nationwide lockdown performed in opposing ways. Though COVID-19 pre-lockdown had a significant, negative impact on Vietnam's stock returns, the lockdown period had a significant, positive influence on stock performance of the entire market and the different business sectors in Vietnam. The financial sector was hardest hit on the Vietnam stock market during the COVID-19 outbreak. Research limitations/implications: The study indicates investors' confidence and trust in the Vietnam government's decisions to combat COVID-19 and favorable stocks prices were the main reasons that the Vietnam stock market rebounded during and after lockdown. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the impact of COVID-19 during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods on stock performance in Vietnam, a rapidly developing economy that was successful in controlling the pandemic with a rejuvenated stock market after lockdown. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Converging evidence from the current pandemic, previous outbreaks and controlled experiments indicates that SARS-CoVs are present in wastewater for several days, leading to potential health risks via waterborne and aerosolized wastewater pathways. Conventional wastewater treatment provides only partial removal of SARS-CoVs, thus safe disposal or reuse will depend on the efficacy of final disinfection. This underscores the need for a risk assessment and management framework tailored to SARS-CoV-2 transmission via wastewater, including new tools for environmental surveillance, ensuring adequate disinfection as a component of overall COVID-19 pandemic containment. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

Adoption of green fertilizer a potential resolution The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more than 4.3 million confirmed cases and more than 2,90,000 deaths worldwide. It has also given rise to fears of an imminent economic crisis and recession. Social distance, self-isolation, and travel restrictions have led to a reduction in the workforce across all economical sectors and have led to a loss of many jobs. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured goods has decreased. On the other hand, the need for medical supplies has increased significantly. The food sector is also facing increased demand as a result of panic buying and storing food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on the various aspects of the world economy. In Malaysia, the COVID-19 epidemic has checked the resilience of the agriculture sector. Especially the Malaysian paddy industry as country imports 30% of its overall consumption from different parts of the world. The real price of rice triplicating for the consumers, which was alarming for nations in this pandemic situation. The Government of Malaysia introduced the National Agrofood Policy 2011–2020 (NAP4) in 2010 as a guidance document for the implementation of agricultural sector development programs and projects in Malaysia. The NAP4 ‘s 10-year term is to be finished by the end of 2020. Several sectors demonstrate substantial success after approximately 8 years of introduction, while the other classes often lag behind the goal and progress quite slowly. Agricultural sector performance is affected by many problems and challenges. In acknowledgment of the poor success of this field, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Based Industry has launched new approaches, policies, and programs that can change the agricultural sector more rapidly. The new direction is aimed at ensuring national food security and boosting farm and revenues. The authorized government agency needs to revise the policy formulation where Malaysia needs to set stages to revolutionize and modernize the rice farming to address the problem faced by the paddy sector in this pandemic situation to adopt GF. In this study, the researcher focuses on the improvisation of the policy to increase the paddy production sustainably. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of social isolation on the physical and mental health of older adults and to learn how they are informing themselves about the pandemic. It is a qualitative study with a phenomenological basis, composed by telephone interviews with 35 older adults (70,5 ± 4,7 years) of both genders, members of a Brazilian University of Third Age, during the period of the pandemic. The testimonies revealed a considerable degree of concern about the possibility of being infected by the virus, increased anxiety due to tragic news, the growing number of deaths, the collapse of the Brazilian economy and the rising unemployment rate. The group reported sleep disorders, joint pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, and reduced functional capacity. Everyone felt sufficiently informed about Covid-19. The main means of gaining information about the pandemic was radio, followed by TV, dialogue with family and friends, and WhatsApp. Only 30% of the participants used WhatsApp, praised because of its multiple functions and the ability to re-read the news. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.   Beyond transmission: Dire need for integration of nutrition interventions in COVID-19 pandemic-response strategies in developing countries like Pakistan Synergistic associations between infection and nutrition are well known. Impact of nutrition interventions on the outcomes have been scientifically assessed and reported. The role of nutrition in limiting the infection related morbidity and mortality does not appear to be a debatable question but nutrition interventions do not appear to be an essential part of current COVID-19 management strategies. Given the nature of pandemic and lack of organism-specific evidence, variability in nutrition interventions and lack of nutrition interventions is not unexpected. However, delay in realization of the crucial need of nutrition interventions to limit the immediate and long term outcomes at personal and community level may aggravate health related issues that can have long term impact on quality of life and economy. Due to existing undernutrition and lack of nutrition related awareness and competence, need for timely and appropriate interventions is much more critical for developing countries. This manuscript highlights the need and feasibility of various nutrition interventions to assure optimum quality of life during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Available evidence provides enough guidance for nutrition interventions that are safe and promise to accrue various degrees of benefits with almost no likelihood of harm. Nutrition interventions suggested by author are: 1) population level efforts for promoting better use of existing resources; 2) quicker augmentation of nutrition status of high risk people and non-hospitalized cases by use of supplement and individualized guidance and 3) nutritional support of sever case by timely and adequate enteral and parenteral feeding. © 2020, Professional Medical Publications.

In response, governments have made available temporary financial support, but not to those tourist enterprises and workers in the undeclared economy. Reporting a 2019 Eurobarometer survey, this paper reveals that one in 165 European citizens engage in undeclared work in tourism and the groups involved. To bring these enterprises and workers onto the radar of the state, a voluntary disclosure initiative is advocated offering access to the temporary financial support for undeclared enterprises and workers disclosing their previous undeclared work. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd coronavirus; COVID-19; informal economy; public policy; tax evasion; tourism industry  Trends in expert system development: A practicum content analysis in vocational education for over grow pandemic learning problems The impact of the COVID-19 has emerged as a varied issue, ranging from the economy, society's social order, and edu-cation, especially when social and physical distancing have been introduced in various areas of community activities as one of the prevention. It has also affected the tertiary education institution where learning activities should be con-ducted from and at home, forcing the higher education communities to shift learning from conventional learning to online learning. Needless to say, learning that does not re-quire practicum is easier compared to learning that needs it. Consequently, it is a new task for lecturers to ensure the meaningful practicum learning implementation is con-ducted as it should be. Therefore, the creation of expert systems for practicum learning in vocational education is urgently required in online learning. The aim of this literature review was to examine the development of an expert system used at practicum learning in tertiary institutions and how the design of learning systems could be integrated into vocational education in facing the COVID-19 pandemic. The method used was the literature study, through research stages starting from the finding and selection of articles and journals with relevant topics, and then analysing the data. The findings of this study was to identify the development of an expert program in an attempt to promote practicum learning using e-learning in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. © 2020 Tim Pengembang Jurnal UPI.

She further lays claim to an extended EEZ of approximately 103,320 km2 and has 13,600 km2 of inland waters. The government recognizes the potential of this maritime resource to boost the country’s economic outlook and has made Blue Economy (BE) part of the economic pillar in its development blueprint. For effective development of the BE, Kenya needs, among other things, to: build human resource capacity through investing in marine education and training; boost marine scientific research; support the traditional industries of fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, blue biotechnology, ports and shipping; develop BE database; resolve outstanding boundary disputes; and reduce illegal unreported and unregulated fishing. The study posits that Kenya already has sector-wise experiences and assets as demonstrated by the numerous government institutions participating in the BE and is only lacking policy integration, coordination and coherence. © 2020 Indian Ocean Research Group.

Proactive information-sharing enabled citizens to develop a shared understanding of the situation, comply with the newly adopted rules and safety measures, and build confidence in their government’s abilities to manage the crisis. The case suggests that smart governance in South Korea can help to enable a smart form of justice that involves equity and fairness in information sharing and resource allocation among its residents and visitors, mitigates discrimination and exclusion, and facilitates democracy through an informed and involved citizenry. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Weak medical infrastructure and over-reliance on medical aids may eventually predict worse outcomes in Africa. To reverse this trend, Africa must re-evaluate the only area with strategic advantage; phytotherapy. One of the many plants with previous antiviral potency is against RNA viruses is Aframomum melegueta. In this study, one hundred (100) A. melegueta secondary metabolites have been mined and computational evaluated for inhibition of host furin, and SARS-COV-2 targets including 3C-like proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro), 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase (nsp16) and surface glycoprotein/ACE2 receptor interface. Silica-gel column partitioning of A. melegueta fruit/seed resulted in 6 fractions tested against furin activity. Diarylheptanoid (Letestuianin A), phenylpropanoid (4-Cinnamoyl-3-hydroxy-spiro[furan-5,2′-(1′H)-indene]-1′,2,3′(2′H,5H)-trione), flavonoids (Quercetin, Apigenin and Tectochrysin) have been identified as high-binding compounds to SARS-COV-2 targets in a polypharmacology manner. Di-ethyl-ether (IC50 = 0.03 mg/L), acetone (IC50 = 1.564 mg/L), ethyl-acetate (IC50 = 0.382 mg/L) and methanol (IC50 = 0.438 mg/L) fractions demonstrated the best inhibition in kinetic assay while DEF, ASF and MEF completely inhibited furin-recognition sequence containing Ebola virus-pre-glycoprotein. In conclusion, A. melegueta and its secondary metabolites have potential for addressing the therapeutic needs of African population during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Aframomum melegueta; COVID-19; Diarylheptanoid; flavonoids; phenylpropanoid; SARS-COV-2  Identification of promising drug candidates against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2 through computational drug repurposing study The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the disease COVID 19, a global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented loss of life and economy worldwide. Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2′-O position of the viral nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free energy of–12.83 ± 0.52 kcal/mol. The second best inhibitor, Galuteolin is a natural compound that inhibits tyrosinase enzyme with MM-PBSA binding free energy value of −11.21 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. Detailed ligand and protein interactions were analyzed and common residues across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV were identified. We propose Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and Galuteolin as the potential inhibitors of NSP16. The results in this study can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 and can also form the basis of rational drug design against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. coronavirus; COVID-19; docking; drug repurposing; MD simulation; virtual screening  “A Plague upon Your Howling”: art and culture in the viral emergency In this introduction, we outline the context for the international emergence of cultural policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our article first offers a general account of how arts and culture have been affected by the pandemic, before looking at some of the state interventions (bailouts’) to support the professional sector, and the present and future conditions they might be seeking to preserve or occasion. We then examine the UK as a particular case study. In rejecting a politics of “bailout” and “return”, and in synchrony with others seeking to situate culture in a re-vitalised political economy, we argue that professional arts and culture needs to move forward with a “new deal” in hand; one that can enhance culture’s potential and multipart value, as well as help the sector progressively engage with the many social, economic and environmental challenges ahead and beyond C-19. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

This represents a very significant challenge for tourism as a growth system. Much attention has been paid to different tourism subsectors such as aviation, accommodation, and activities to reduce emissions, mostly on the basis of (future) technology. However, the Paris Agreement demands immediate action and significant year-on-year progress on a zero-carbon trajectory. This article discusses destination management under the new low-carbon imperative. It analyses challenges, including economic viability and resilience, that have also gained importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and explores opportunities for better profitability on the basis of a leakage/spending value dichotomy proposition. The final section highlights the foremost role that destination managers must play in building prosperous and resilient low-carbon tourism destination systems and discusses the key insights for destination managers. © The Author(s) 2020. carbon management; climate change; COVID-19; destination management; resilience; value generation  Zoonotic and reverse zoonotic events of SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on global health Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The viruses have adapted to infect a large number of animal species, ranging from bats to camels. At present, seven CoVs infect humans, of which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe. Healthcare systems around the globe have been stretched beyond their limits posing new challenges to emergency healthcare services and critical care. The outbreak continues to jeopardize human health, social life and economy. All known human CoVs have zoonotic origins. Recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pet, zoo and certain farm animals has highlighted its potential for reverse zoonosis. This scenario is particularly alarming, since these animals could be potential reservoirs for secondary zoonotic infections. In this article, we highlight interspecies SARS-CoV-2 infections and focus on the reverse zoonotic potential of this virus. We also emphasize the importance of potential secondary zoonotic events and the One-Health and One-World approach to tackle such future pandemics. © 2020 The Author(s).

A Dsge Modeling In Small Open Economy This article aims to investigate the relationship between inbound tourism and housing market along with the recent boom in Icelandic real estate sector, in which both house and rental prices have been rising dramatically. To this end, we construct a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model enclosing a tourism sector and a housing market with owner-occupied and rental sections. The simulation results unveil a transmission channel that indicates the higher inbound tourism demand raises both house prices and rental prices. Variance decomposition and historical decomposition show that both inbound tourism demand shock and manufacturing technology shock are the key driving forces of the fluctuations of Icelandic house prices, consumption, and investment, whereas housing preference shock plays the most important role in determining the volatility of rental prices. The policy implications indicate that any shocks to tourism could easily spillover to housing market dynamics and aggregate fluctuations. © The Author(s) 2020.

The authors analyse the economic, social and political factors that have shaped the government's fiscal policy response to this economic shock. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyse the federal and provincial budget documents for the fiscal year 2020–21 to study the fiscal response of the government. The authors review recent research articles and news pieces to examine the determinants of these budgetary measures. Findings: The government adopted expansionary fiscal policy measures such as reduced taxation and increased government expenditure to counter the recessionary pressures of the pandemic. These measures, however, were largely constrained by macroeconomic issues of high fiscal debt, slow economic growth and low fiscal space and political influences from the military and religious groups. Research limitations/implications: The coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing issue which may pose more threats and elicit more policy responses as it evolves. This research may be extended as the pandemic progresses, to include further policy responses. Originality/value: This research provides insight into the unique problems faced by the Pakistani government during the pandemic, and how it steers the economy despite these limitations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

It became a political highlight of the Japanese government and was taken over 2017 and 2018 as a vision for the Japanese economy and society, to take over the lead ahead of the world to make people's life more comfortable and sustainable. Smart Systems, i.e. largely deployed and interconnected CPS (cyber-physical system and IoT networks) and integrated intelligence and autonomy are considered the drivers of innovation. In all industrial and social areas highly automated or autonomous intelligent systems are taking over tasks and services - and maybe, one day, control of our lives. The keynote will raise questions and discuss impact, risks, ethical issues and challenges such as “Can a technology dependent and technology driven society be resilient and sustainable? Can technology make a society resilient and sustainable? Will the role of humans change in such a society? What are the trade-offs with respect to human rights, self-determination, independence or will “Big Brother” control risks become overwhelming? The keynote will address issues that are already evident now and how resilience, sustainability and ethical issues are now discussed in different context - particularly how can a resilient society manage a crisis like the Climate Crises, and Covid-19 - a situation that has revealed vulnerabilities and will hopefully lead to a rethinking of some economic and societal systemic issues. © 2019 by the authors.

The fracture in the world economy between the USA and China is the result of Government policy, but its relationship to rising VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) elements in globalization is more complex than simple policy changes. This paper suggests that a reappraisal of theory is required, not least because of the eruption of Covid-19, but that internalization theory is the best source of theoretical restructuring in the face of the new empirical realities facing the global economy. © 2020, Academy of International Business.

These applications could satisfy the diverse needs in the ecosystem of agricultural products, e.g., increasing transparency of food safety and IoT based food quality control, provenance traceability, improvement of contract exchanges, and transactions efficiency. As multiple untrusted parties, including small-scale farmers, food processors, logistic companies, distributors and retailers, are involved into the complex farm-to-fork pipeline, it becomes vital to achieve optimal trade-off between efficiency and integrity of the agricultural management systems as required in contexts. In this paper, we provide a survey to study both techniques and applications of blockchain technology used in the agricultural sector. First, the technical elements, including data structure, cryptographic methods, and consensus mechanisms are explained in detail. Secondly, the existing agricultural blockchain applications are categorized and reviewed to demonstrate the use of the blockchain techniques. In addition, the popular platforms and smart contract are provided to show how practitioners use them to develop these agricultural applications. Thirdly, we identify the key challenges in many prospective agricultural systems, and discuss the efforts and potential solutions to tackle these problems. Further, we conduct an improved food supply chain in the post COVID-19 pandemic economy as an illustration to demonstrate an effective use of blockchain technology. © 2013 IEEE. agricultural applications; Blockchain technology; data integrity; food supply chains management; traceability Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Food safety; Food supply; Supply chains; Agricultural management systems; Agricultural sector; Agricultural system; Cryptographic methods; Food processors; Food quality controls; Popular platform; Small scale farmers; Blockchain Whither Presidential Approval? Until recently, presidential job approval has been positively correlated with a healthy economy. Despite pre-COVID-19 sanguine macroeconomic indicators, President Donald Trump's job approval numbers appear to be quite low relative to those of his predecessors. Using a Bayesian model to infer latent presidential approval, we regress approval on consumer sentiment, finding strong evidence of a structural break commencing with the inauguration of President Barack Obama. We also find that the positive associations between presidential approval and consumer sentiment have weakened. Finally, we posit that a polarized political landscape may contribute to the changing of the meaning of presidential approval, which now appears to be a proxy for partisanship. © 2020 Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress   Financial geography II: The impacts of FinTech – Financial sector and centres, regulation and stability, inclusion and governance In this report, I review interdisciplinary research on the actual and potential consequences of FinTech, with emphasis on ideas from and for geographers, and three areas: financial sector and centres, financial regulation and stability, and financial inclusion and governance. I show that the consequences of FinTech are full of controversies, which are part of broader, long-standing debates on the role of finance in economy and society, and need to be approached from geographical perspectives. The intense fusion of fin and tech, arguably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, complicates and elevates these controversies to a new level. © The Author(s) 2020. financial geography; financial governance; financial inclusion; financial regulation; financial stability; financial technology; FinTech  Multinational enterprises and the governance of sustainability practices in emerging market supply chains: An agile governance perspective Advanced economy multinational enterprises (AMNEs) face idiosyncratic challenges related to the governance of their sustainability practices in their emerging market supply chains. One way for AMNEs to address these challenges would be by adopting agile sustainability governance mechanisms. Drawing on the theories of experimentalist governance and deliberation, we propose a processual framework suited to develop agile sustainability governance mechanisms. We explore the challenges to supplier participation and the factors that enable an authentic dialogue in the process. We contribute to the scholarship on transnational governance and strategic agility, and offer practical implications which are also relevant for disruptions like COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Addressing this challenge, particularly as it pertains to Eurasia, our multinational group of scholars draws on past and ongoing research to suggest a roadmap for a new pandemic politics research subfield. Key research questions include not only how states are responding to the new coronavirus, but also reciprocal interactions between the pandemic and society, political economy, regime type, center-periphery relations, and international security.

Economic regulation and E-scooter networks in the USA This paper looks at the challenges in the economic regulation of stand-up electronic scooters, or “e-scooters”. The e-scooter represents one of several innovative modes that have emerged to cater for transportation needs in urban areas. They provide connectivity linking local origins and destinations, as well as interconnectivity linking urban locations to inter-urban networks. These vehicles are marketed as a micro form of public transportation designed to meet the needs of fit and able people wishing to make trips of two miles or less. They are touted as part of “micromobility” complementing existing transportation networks. This paper reviews the gray and limited academic economic literature looking at the viability and economics of e-scooters within the context of the regulatory environment in which they operate in US cities. It considers the ways regulatory structures are evolving as the authorities learn of the attributes and limitations of the mode. In doing this, the paper also makes comparisons with some of the other “novel” forms of local transportation that have emerged, including those offered by transportation network companies. The paper focuses on the pre-Covid-19 period. © 2020 Disruptive innovations; E-scooters; Economic core; Economic regulation; Gig-economy; Nudging; Sharing economy; Technical externalities  The pandemic and economic policy uncertainty The events that occurred after the worldwide diffusion of COVID-19 provide a real-life example of how uncertainty can severely affect the global economy. This paper reviews literature on the negative impacts of the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) as developed by Baker et al., The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2016, 131, 1593–1636 on individuals, businesses, governments, and economies at the local and international levels. This reveals that a high EPU is associated with adverse effects on households, corporations, and governments, which tend to delay many financial decisions under high uncertainty, which leads to lower consumption, fewer issuances of debt, fewer investments, and higher unemployment. The effects of political and regulatory uncertainty also extend to the commodity markets, such as the adverse effects on both oil and gasoline markets, and can potentially create adverse impacts on the crypto-currency market and its potential growth. We demonstrate that governmental uncertainty also affects financial, housing, and equity markets; debt issuances; and the entire economy. This underscores the importance of considering EPU as a risk factor. The association with several components of the global economy reflects not only the EPU index's critical influence, but also the importance of risk management. Our results lead us to consider the gravity of economic policy uncertainty and call for innovation across different sectors to mitigate its adverse effects. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Capital investment; corporate finance; economic policy uncertainty; macro-economic & microeconomics; risk management  The state and national competitiveness (The case of EU) The article aims to explore the possibilities and contribution of the state in ensuring the competitiveness of the economy of the EU countries. Various definitions of the concept of national competitiveness are presented as well as directions in which the state affects national competitiveness. Among the latter, state procurements of goods and services and their varieties are considered. Special importance of the indirect influence of the state on the country’s competitiveness in the form of creating favorable investment climate, pursuing structural policy, and establishing clear rules for doing business is emphasized. The analysis of the possibilities and methods of state regulation of business activities based on a number of indicators of international organizations is presented. The use of new opportunities by the state in the context of digitalization of the economy to ensure competitiveness is highlighted. The role of the state and PPP in the development of infrastructure, which serves as a guarantor and stimulator of national competitiveness, is examined. The conclusion is made that the role of the state in national competitiveness is increasing, especially under the spread of COVID-19. © 2020, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

Current WTO rules dividing all subsidies into prohibited or actionable categories are no longer fit for purpose. Piecemeal efforts in preferential trade agreements and bi- or trilateral configurations offer a basis on which to build but are too narrow in scope. Addressing spillover effects of subsidies could start with G20 countries launching a work programme to mobilise an epistemic community concerned with subsidy policies, tasked with building a more solid evidence base on the magnitude, purpose and effects of subsidy policies. The need for such cooperation has become even more pressing by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated increase in the use of subsidy programmes in major economies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd G20; international cooperation; spillovers; Subsidy policies; WTO  Are Business Valuators Biased? A Psychological Perspective on the Causes of Valuation Disputes Business valuations of the same company made by different valuators frequently diverge, resulting in lengthy and costly disputes. This paper takes a novel approach in explaining inconsistencies in business valuations by adopting a psychological perspective and offering a first investigation into the role of cognitive biases in valuations. In two experimental studies (N = 331) we show that valuators can be affected by both anchoring bias and engagement bias (i.e., being affected by a client’s interests). These findings cast doubt on the notion of fair value and demonstrate the importance of recognizing the psychology of business valuations. Our contribution is timely considering the current COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath in which accurate valuations will be paramount, but also extremely complex due to the high degree of uncertainty in the economy and underlying industries. © 2020 The Author(s).

Yet levels of oil production and consumption remain high in the state. This gap between California's oil politics and its climate ambitions is deepened by decentralized decision-making processes. County officials are tasked with extractive planning decisions that have wide-ranging implications. In this Viewpoint article, we analyze proposals for enhanced extraction at the Cat Canyon oilfield in Santa Barbara County. After two of three proposals were withdrawn in recent months, we highlight how it has been oil industry volatility and public opposition – rather than state regulations – that have brought county development plans into closer alignment with state climate goals. As California pursues a goal of ‘managing the decline’ of domestic oil production, we identify strategies for bridging such gaps between local decision-making and state-level climate action, including: a comprehensive state-wide ban on new enhanced oil extraction projects; a 2,500 ft buffer zone around extraction sites; and revenue generation schemes that support a just transition. As Covid-19 forces an oil surplus and lowered production, there are opportunities to enact such changes – particularly by redirecting oil industry labor toward the growing problem of well decommissioning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd California; Climate change; Enhanced oil extraction; Environmental justice; Just transition  Providing a foundation for decent work and adequate income during health and economic crises: constitutional approaches in 193 countries Purpose: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads globally, the economic and health consequences are disproportionately affecting marginalized workers. However, countries' existing labor and social security laws often exclude the most vulnerable workers from coverage, exacerbating existing inequalities. Guaranteeing the rights to adequate income even when ill, decent working conditions and nondiscrimination in constitutions may provide a foundation for protecting rights universally, safeguarding against counterproductive austerity measures, and providing a normative foundation for equality and inclusion as economies recover. The purpose of this article is to examine the prevalence of these rights globally and assess some of their early impacts amid the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors created and analyzed a database of constitutional rights for all 193 United Nations member states. All constitutions were double coded by an international multidisciplinary, multilingual team of researchers. Findings: This study finds that 54% of countries take some approach to guaranteeing income security in their constitutions, including 23% that guarantee income security during illness. Thirty-one percent guarantee the right to safe working conditions. Only 36% of constitutions explicitly guarantee at least some aspect of nondiscrimination at work. With respect to equal rights broadly, constitutional protections are most common on the basis of sex (85%), followed by religion (78%), race/ethnicity (76%), socioeconomic status (59%), disability (27%), citizenship (22%), sexual orientation (5%) and gender identity (3%). Across almost all areas, protections for rights are far more common in constitutions adopted more recently. Originality/value: This is the first study to systematically examine protections for income security and decent work, together with nondiscrimination, in the constitutions of all 193 UN member states. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

"3","12","Increased plastic pollution due to COVID-19 pandemic: Challenges and recommendations Plastics have become a severe transboundary threat to natural ecosystems and human health, with studies predicting a twofold increase in the number of plastic debris (including micro and nano-sized plastics) by 2030. However, such predictions will likely be aggravated by the excessive use and consumption of single-use plastics (including personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves) due to COVID-19 pandemic. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the effects of COVID-19 on macroplastic pollution and its potential implications on the environment and human health considering short- and long-term scenarios; addressing the main challenges and discussing potential strategies to overcome them. It emphasises that future measures, involved in an emergent health crisis or not, should reflect a balance between public health and environmental safety as they are both undoubtedly connected. Although the use and consumption of plastics significantly improved our quality of life, it is crucial to shift towards sustainable alternatives, such as bio-based plastics. Plastics should remain in the top of the political agenda in Europe and across the world, not only to minimise plastic leakage and pollution, but to promote sustainable growth and to stimulate both green and blue- economies. Discussions on this topic, particularly considering the excessive use of plastic, should start soon with the involvement of the scientific community, plastic producers and politicians in order to be prepared for the near future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The Chinese term for this health services value is jing hua xin ling, psychological destressing. Here we present the first case where optimal tourist infrastructure is influenced by including mental health. Using a multi-stage, cross-lingual, differential stakeholder method, we analyse conflicts between road- and roadless-access tourism in the very large new Sanjiangyuan National Park, Qinghai, which offers jing hua xin ling to domestic tourists from eastern-seaboard cities. This provides a powerful tourism attraction, and hence economic opportunity, for the region around the park. If these mental health aspects are included, together with their direct and indirect consequences for tourism, then roadlessness is preferable to new roads. Similar infrastructure conflicts occur for park tourism worldwide, and jing hua xin ling can provide a global theoretical framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Adventure; COVID-19; Culture; Health; Protected area expenditure; global economy; health services; infrastructure; mental health; national park; tourism economics; tourist attraction; China; Qinghai; Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve SARS-CoV-2 in environmental perspective: Occurrence, persistence, surveillance, inactivation and challenges The unprecedented global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is depicting the distressing pandemic consequence on human health, economy as well as ecosystem services. So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (βCoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The surge mitigation is complicated and associates many factors, including the pandemic status, policy, socioeconomics and resident behaviours. Modelling and analytics with spatial-temporal big urban data are required to assist the mitigation of the pandemic. This study proposes a novel perspective to analyse the spatial-temporal potential exposure risk of residents by capturing human behaviours based on spatial-temporal car park availability data. Near real-time data from 1,904 residential car parks in Singapore, a classical megacity, are collected to analyse car mobility and its spatial-temporal heat map. The implementation of the circuit breaker, a COVID-19 measure, in Singapore has reduced the mobility and heat (daily frequency of mobility) significantly at about 30.0%. It contributes to a 44.3%–55.4% reduction in the transportation-related air emissions under two scenarios of travelling distance reductions. Urban sustainability impacts in both environment and economy are discussed. The spatial-temporal potential exposure risk mapping with space-time interactions is further investigated via an extended Bayesian spatial-temporal regression model. The maximal reduction rate of the defined potential exposure risk lowers to 37.6% by comparison with its peak value. The big data analytics of changes in car mobility behaviour and the resultant potential exposure risks can provide insights to assist in (a) designing a flexible circuit breaker exit strategy, (b) precise management via identifying and tracing hotspots on the mobility heat map, and (c) making timely decisions by fitting curves dynamically in different phases of COVID-19 mitigation. The proposed method has the potential to be used by decision-makers worldwide with available data to make flexible regulations and planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Air-emission reduction; Car mobility behaviour; COVID-19; Flexible lockdown strategy; Risk mitigation; Spatial-temporal analysis Advanced Analytics; Behavioral research; Curve fitting; Data Analytics; Decision making; Electric circuit breakers; Flexible electronics; Garages (parking); Regression analysis; Flexible circuit; Human behaviours; Near real-time datum; Potential exposure; Regression model; Space-time interactions; Spatial temporals; Urban sustainability; Sustainable development A critical review of the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and ecosystems and opportunities for circular economy strategies The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, but the world is still reeling from its aftermath. Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus. These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country's economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015–2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic. Therefore, stricter laws must be enacted to protect the environment in Egypt. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Absorbing aerosol index; Carbon monoxide and ozone; COVID-19; Environmental impacts in Egypt; Medical and municipal solid wastes; Nitrogen dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; disease prevalence; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; groundwater pollution; nitrogen dioxide; recycling; satellite data; solid waste; viral disease; Alexandria [Egypt]; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt; Coronavirus Challenges and strategies for effective plastic waste management during and post COVID-19 pandemic The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the complexities of plastic waste management. Our improved, hyper-hygienic way of life in the fear of transmission has conveniently shifted our behavioral patterns like the use of PPE (Personal protective equipment), increased demand for plastic-packaged food and groceries, and the use of disposable utensils. The inadequacies and inefficiencies of our current waste management system to deal with the increased dependence on plastic could aggravate its mismanagement and leakage into the environment, thus triggering a new environmental crisis. Mandating scientific sterilization and the use of sealed bags for safe disposal of contaminated plastic wastes should be an immediate priority to reduce the risk of transmission to sanitation workers. Investments in circular technologies like feedstock recycling, improving the infrastructure and environmental viability of existing techniques could be the key to dealing with the plastic waste fluxes during such a crisis. Transition towards environmentally friendly materials like bioplastics and harboring new sustainable technologies would be crucial to fighting future pandemics. Although the rollbacks and relaxation of single-use plastic bans may be temporary, their likely implications on the consumer perception could hinder our long-term goals of transitioning towards a circular economy. Likewise, any delay in building international willingness and participation to curb any form of pollution through summits and agendas may also delay its implementation. Reduction in plastic pollution and at the same time promoting sustainable plastic waste management technologies can be achieved by prioritizing our policies to instill individual behavioral as well as social, institutional changes. Incentivizing measures that encourage circularity and sustainable practices, and public-private investments in research, infrastructure and marketing would help in bringing the aforementioned changes. Individual responsibility, corporate action, and government policy are all necessary to keep us from transitioning from one disaster to another. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Within an inevitable revamping attention on the need for government intervention to face the challenges raised by the Covid19 pandemic, industrial policy is appearing as a central piece of the puzzle. As production dynamics in every country is highly affected by the crisis, industrial policy is considered part of the response to solve dramatic economic and social problems deriving by extraordinary levels of unemployment, deprivation and poverty. In this paper, we argue that a turning point on the connection between industrial policy, sustainability and development has been reached, highlighting the need to rethink its theoretical foundations as well as its governance and implementation processes for a new role in our post-Covid 19 societies. Therefore, the research question underlying this paper deals primarily with the nexus between the debate on industrial policy and its effects in terms of human development, social cohesion and sustainability. For this reason, we attempt at closing the gap between different strands of literature, whose integrated connection leads to a new analytical framework with real-world implications on the role of industrial policy, not only as tool for productive dynamics, but also as a leverage for sustainable human development. All in all, we aim at contributing to the debate on our post-Covid19 economies and societies in two ways: firstly, by providing a new integrated analytical framework on industrial policy to steer a sustainable structural change of our economies and societies towards sustainable human development; secondly, by identifying preliminary implications on industrial policy governance and implementation, investing in the accurate and transparent design of industrial policy in the post-Covid19 era. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Covid19 pandemic; Government intervention; Industrial policy; Sustainable human development; Sustainable structural change COVID-19; human development index; industrial policy; state role; structural change; sustainability; sustainable development; viral disease Socioeconomic restrictions slowdown COVID-19 far more effectively than favorable weather-evidence from the satellite We model the impact of restricting socioeconomic activities (SA) on the transmission of COVID-19 globally. Countries initiate public health measures to slow virus transmission, ranging from stringent quarantines including city lockdown to simpler social distancing recommendations. We use satellite readings of NO2, a pollutant emitted from socioeconomic activities, as a proxy for the level of social-economic restrictions, and discuss the implications under the influences of weather. We found that restricting SA has a leading contribution to lowering the reproductive number of COVID-19 by 18.3% ± 3.5%, while air temperature, the highest contributor among all weather-related variables only contributes 8.0% ± 2.6%. The reduction effects by restricting SA becomes more pronounced (23% ± 3.0%) when we limited the data to China and developed countries where the indoor climate is mostly controlled. We computed the spared infectees by restricting SA until mid-April. Among all polities, China spared 40,964 (95% CI 31,463-51,470) infectees with 37,727 (95% CI, 28,925-47,488) in the Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Europe spared 174,494 (95% CI 139,202-210,841) infectees, and the United States (US) spared 180,336 (95% CI 142,860-219,445) with 79,813 (95% CI 62,887-97,653) in New York State. In the same period, many regions except for China, Australia, and South Korea see a steep upward trend of spared infectees due to restricting SA with the US and Europe far steeper, signaling a greater risk of reopening the economy too soon. Latin America and Africa show less reduction of transmissivity through the region-by-time fixed effects than other regions, indicating a higher chance of becoming an epicenter soon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

There is an immediate need for identification of effective drugs to contain the disastrous virus outbreak. Global efforts are already underway at a war footing to identify the best drug combination to address the disease. In this review, an attempt has been made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, and based on this information potential druggable targets against SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. Also, the strategies for ongoing and future drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are outlined. Given the urgency to find a definitive cure, ongoing drug repurposing efforts being carried out by various organizations are also described. The unprecedented crisis requires extraordinary efforts from the scientific community to effectively address the issue and prevent further loss of human lives and health. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.

The calibrated model predicts that the average propensity to consume household wealth will decline, while the demand for money will increase, and these predictions are consistent with the data. Monetary policy is effective because it provides enough liquidity for households to buffer health risks. Monetary stimulus is more effective in an economy with greater health risks and consumption uncertainty. Counterfactual experiments show that abandoning the containment policy too early would avoid a sharp drop in output and employment in the short term, but it would greatly increase mortality and ultimately lead to a decline in social welfare. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe has resulted a newer challenge and paradigm for an evolving socio-scientific priorities. It is generally expected that the impacts of the pandemic would be in shorter time-scale, while the planned time and pathway for attaining the SDG are typically mandated in longer-term, hence may remain mostly unaffected. However, the stringent lockdown measures, isolated economies and financial burden to contain the pandemic emergency have resulted to slowdown of socio-economic development, which if continues for a longer period, would put a question mark on developing plans and pathways to achieve the SDGs, even in decadal-scale. Hence, in these newer times, it is important to understand the real priorities of availability of clean water and air, which are already stressed worldwide and in India, because of various natural and human-influenced triggers. This ongoing pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the impact of human development and consequent feedback of nature and human society in pre- and post-COVID scenarios on water–air–human life, which can help to re-think and re-orient the societal development priorities. It is a rare opportunity for scientists to impress the policy-makers with real-time examples on the efficacies of potential mitigation strategies for climate change, water and air pollution, and the importance of enduring investment on environmental causes and consequent benefits that can secure health and development for our future generations.

We couple the model to economic considerations — we formulate an optimal control problem in which the cost to the economy of the various non-pharmaceutical interventions is minimized, subject to hospital admissions never exceeding a threshold value corresponding to health-service capacity. Within the framework of the model, the optimal strategy of disease control is revealed to be one of disease suppression, rather than disease mitigation. © 2020 The Author(s) Optimal control; SEIR model; Simulated annealing Optimal control systems; Disease suppression; Economic considerations; Hospital admissions; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Optimal control problem; Optimal control strategy; Optimal strategies; Piece-wise constants; Disease control The People's bank of China's response to the coronavirus pandemic: A quantitative assessment The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has implemented numerous measures to cushion the impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis on the Chinese economy. Since the current monetary policy framework features a multi-instrument mix of liquidity tools and pricing signals, we employ a dynamic-factor modelling approach to derive a composite indicator of China's monetary policy stance. Our quantitative assessment shows that the PBoC's policy response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been swift and decisive. Specifically, our estimates reveal that the PBoC has implemented novel policy measures to ensure that commercial banks maintain liquidity access and credit provision during the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The catastrophic impact a pandemic has on humans and economy should serve as a reminder to be better prepared to the advent of known and unknown pathogens in the future. The goal of having a set of initiatives and procedures to tackle them is the need of the hour. Rapid detection and point-of-care (POC) analysis of pathogens causing these diseases is not only a problem entailing the scientific community but also raises challenges in tailoring appropriate treatment strategies to the healthcare sector. Among the various methods used to detect pathogens, Electrochemical Biosensor Technology is at the forefront in the development of POC devices. Electrochemical Biosensors stand in good stead due to their rapid response, high sensitivity and selectivity and ease of miniaturization to name a few advantages. This review explores the innovations in electrochemical biosensing based on the various electroanalytical techniques including voltammetry, impedance, amperometry and potentiometry and discusses their potential in diagnosis of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (Re-EIDs), which are potential pandemic threats. © 2020 Amperometry; Corona Virus; COVID-19; Impedance; Potentiometry; Voltammetry Biosensors; Diagnosis; Electroanalytical techniques; Electrochemical biosensing; Electrochemical biosensor; Emerging infectious disease; Healthcare sectors; High sensitivity; Re-emerging infectious disease; Scientific community; Diseases Nonuniform impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality over the United States Most of the state governments in United States (U.S.) issued lockdown or business restrictions amid the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, which created a unique opportunity to evaluate the air quality response to reduced economic activities. Data acquired from 28 long-term air quality stations across the U.S. revealed widespread but nonuniform reductions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) during the first phase of lockdown (March 15–April 25, 2020) relative to a pre-lockdown reference period and historical baselines established in 2017–2019. The reductions, up to 49% for NO2 and 37% for CO, are statistically significant at two thirds of the sites and tend to increase with local population density. Significant reductions of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) only occurred in the Northeast and California/Nevada metropolises where NO2 declined the most, while the changes in ozone (O3) were mixed and relatively minor. These findings are consistent with lower transportation and utility demands that dominate NO2 and CO emissions, especially in major urban areas, due to the lockdown. This study provides an insight into potential public health benefits with more aggressive air quality management, which should be factored into strategies to reopen the U.S. and global economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It is largely unknown how the human immune system responds to this infection. A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be important to develop therapeutics against COVID-19. Here, we have used transcriptomic profile of human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells (A549) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and employed a network biology approach to generate human-virus interactome. Network topological analysis discovers 15 SARS-CoV-2 targets, which belongs to a subset of interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs (IFIT1, IFITM1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1, and OAS2) can be considered as potential candidates for drug targets in the treatments of COVID-19. We have identified significant interaction between ISGs and TLR3 agonists, like poly I: C, and imiquimod, and suggests that TLR3 agonists can be considered as a potential drug for drug repurposing in COVID-19. Our network centric analysis suggests that moderating the innate immune response is a valuable approach to target COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The epidemic of the COVID-19 has presented as a grim and complex situation, causing great impact on economy and society, and seriously interfering with ordinary medical practice, threatening to exceed healthcare capacity in many countries over the globe. With no doubt, dealing with the COVID-19 has caused great social and medical crisis that presented great challenges to the medical and healthcare society, forcing it to face unprecedented times, and to reconceptualize how to provide quality health care while enforcing public health measures necessary for pandemic containment and optimal allocation of healthcare resources. However, along with this unparalleled time challenges, came great opportunities for changes and improvements, for innovations and creative solutions, some of which should be adopted and incorporated to the daily medical practices and social routine, even in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era. © 2020 COVID-19; Infectious disease; SARS-CoV-2; Shared decision making Article; artificial intelligence; awareness; bioinformatics; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency ward; health care; health care system; human; hygiene; mathematical model; medical practice; nonhuman; priority journal; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; shared decision making; telemedicine; vaccination Covid-19 pandemic and food: Present knowledge, risks, consumers fears and safety Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that has paralyzed social life and the economy around the world since the end of 2019, and which has so far killed nearly 600,000 people. The rapidity of its spread and the lack of detailed research on the course and methods of transmission significantly impede both its eradication and prevention. Scope and approach: Due to the high transmission rate and fatality resulting from COVID-19 disease, the paper focuses on analyzing the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 as well as its potential connection with food as a source of pathogen and infection. Key findings and conclusions: There is currently no evidence (scientific publications, WHO, EFSA etc.) that COVID-19 disease can spread directly through food and the human digestive system. However, according to the hypothesis regarding the primary transmission of the virus, the source of which was food of animal origin (meat of wild animals), as well as the fact that food is a basic necessity for humans, it is worth emphasizing that food can, if not directly, be a carrier of the virus. Particular attention should be paid to this indirect pathway when considering the potential for the spread of an epidemic and the development of prevention principles. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Food safety; Prevention; Virus transmission Animals; Digestive system; Transmissions; Viruses; Food of animal origin; High transmission rate; Primary transmission; Scientific publications; Social life; Wild animals; Diseases Temporary reduction in fine particulate matter due to ‘anthropogenic emissions switch-off’ during COVID-19 lockdown in Indian cities The COVID-19 pandemic elicited a global response to limit associated mortality, with social distancing and lockdowns being imposed. In India, human activities were restricted from late March 2020. This ‘anthropogenic emissions switch-off’ presented an opportunity to investigate impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on ambient air quality in five Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to 2020. For each year, we isolated, analysed and compared fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data from 25 March to 11 May, to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Like other global cities, we observed substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations, from 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41–53% (Delhi), 26–54% (Hyderabad), 24–36% (Kolkata), and 10–39% (Mumbai). Generally, cities with larger traffic volumes showed greater reductions. Aerosol loading decreased by 29% (Chennai), 11% (Delhi), 4% (Kolkata), and 1% (Mumbai) against 2019 data. Health and related economic impact assessments indicated 630 prevented premature deaths during lockdown across all five cities, valued at 0.69 billion USD. Improvements in air quality may be considered a temporary lockdown benefit as revitalising the economy could reverse this trend. Regulatory bodies must closely monitor air quality levels, which currently offer a baseline for future mitigation plans. © 2020 The Author(s) Air pollution; Coronavirus pandemic; Emission switch-off; Health and economic impacts; PM2.5 concentration; SARS-CoV-2 Virus Air quality; Ambient air quality; Anthropogenic emissions; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); In-situ measurement; Mitigation measures; PM2.5 concentration; Substantial reduction; Particles (particulate matter) Emotional, Behavioral, and Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 prompted consternation in many parts of the world. Due to its fast dissemination, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020. Aiming to contain the spread of the virus, leaders of many countries restrained social movement, targeting to flatten the curve of contamination with social distancing. This review aimed to analyze how human behavior has changed throughout this period. We also approached the key components of the emotional reaction to the pandemic, how internal and external factors, such as personality traits, gender, the media, the economy and the governmental response, influence the social perception of the pandemic and the psychological outcomes of the current scenario. Moreover, we explored in depth the groups at increased risk of suffering mental health burden secondary to these circumstances. These include the healthcare professionals, elderly individuals, children, college students, black subjects, latin and LGBTQ+ communities, economically disadvantaged groups, the homeless, prisoners, the rural population and psychiatric patients. We also discussed several measures that might minimize the emotional impact derived from this scenario. It is crucial that the health authorities, the government and the population articulate to assist the vulnerable groups and promote emotional and psychological support strategies. Moreover, it is fundamental that the population is provided with accurate information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Pedrosa, Bitencourt, Fróes, Cazumbá, Campos, de Brito and Simões e Silva. behavior; COVID-19; mental health; psychological changes; restricting measures; SARS-CoV-2; social isolation  When pandemics impact economies and climate change: Exploring the impacts of COVID-19 on oil and electricity demand in China Despite all the scientific and technological developments in the past one hundred years, biologic issues such as pandemics are a constant threat to society. While one of the aspects of a pandemic is the loss of human life, the outbreak has multi-dimensional impacts across regional and global societies. In this paper, a comparative regressive and neural network model is developed to analyze the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) on the electricity and petroleum demand in China. The environmental analysis shows that the epidemic severeness significantly affects the electricity and the petroleum demand, both directly and indirectly. The outputs of the model stated that the elasticity of petroleum and electricity demand toward the population of the infected people is −0.1% and −0.65%, respectively. The mentioned results show that pandemic status has a significant impact on energy demand, and also its impacts can be tracked into every corner of human society. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Demand analysis; Economic impacts; Energy policy; Socio-economic analysis  COVID-ABS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemic to simulate health and economic effects of social distancing interventions The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has directly impacted the public health and economy worldwide. To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 Agent-based simulation; COVID-19; Epidemic models; SEIR Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Diseases; Simulation platform; Viruses; Agent-based model; Input parameter; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Python programming language; Social cooperations; Social isolation; Society of agents; Vertical isolation; Economic and social effects Predicting COVID-19 spread in the face of control measures in West Africa The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is causing devastating demographic, social, and economic damage globally. Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to curtail the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West African COVID-19 data project a 67% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 46% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Additionally, disease elimination is possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 5 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic cases are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 8 days, only about 29% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures triggered a 33% reduction in the time-dependent effective reproduction number between February 28 and June 26, 2020. We conclude that curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic burden significantly in West Africa requires more control measures than those that have already been implemented, as well as more mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Several governments issued restrictions on inbound flights to mitigate such risk. But with the pandemic controlled in many countries, some decide to reopen the economy by relaxing the international air travel bans. As the virus has still been prevailing in many regions, this relaxation raises the alarm to import overseas cases and results in the revival of local pandemic. This study proposes a risk index to measure one country's imported case risk from inbound international flights. The index combines both daily dynamic international air connectivity data and the updated global COVID-19 data. It can measure the risk at the country, province and even specific route level. The proposed index was applied to China, which is the first country to experience and control COVID-19 pandemic while later becoming exposed to high imported case risk after the epidemic centers switched to Europe and the US afterward. The calculated risk indexes for each Chinese province or region show both spatial and temporal patterns from January to April 2020. It is found that China's strict restriction on inbound flights since March 26 was very effective to cut the imported case risk by half than doing nothing. But the overall index level kept rising because of the deteriorating pandemic conditions around the world. Hong Kong and Taiwan are the regions facing the highest imported case risk due to their superior international air connectivity and looser restriction on inbound flights. Shandong Province had the highest risk in February and early March due to its well-developed air connectivity with South Korea and Japan when the pandemic peaked in these two countries. Since mid-March, the imported case risk from Europe and the US dramatically increased. Last, we discuss policy implications for the relevant stakeholders to use our index to dynamically adjust the international air travel restrictions. This risk index can also be applied to other contexts and countries to relax restrictions on particular low-risk routes while still restricting the high-risk ones. This would balance the essential air travels need and the requirement to minimize the imported case risk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd China; COVID-19; Imported case risk; International air travel  COVID-19 financial resources for physicians The appropriate focus in managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States has been addressing access and delivery of care to the population affected by the outbreak. All sectors of the U.S. economy have been significantly affected, including physicians. Physician groups of all specialties and sizes have experienced the financial effects of the pandemic. Hospitals have received billions of dollars to support and enable them to manage emergencies and cover the costs of the disruption. However, many vascular surgeons are under great financial pressure because of the postponement of all nonemergency procedures. The federal government has announced a myriad of programs in the form of grants and loans to reimburse physicians for some of their expenses and loss of revenue. It is more than likely that unless the public health emergency subsides significantly, many practices will experience dire consequences without additional financial assistance. We have attempted to provide a concise listing of such programs and resources available to assist vascular surgeons who are small businesses in accessing these opportunities. © 2020 Society for Vascular Surgery Coronavirus Aid; Coronavirus Economic Stabilization Act; COVID-19; Pandemic; Relief and Economic Security Act; Virus compensation; Coronavirus infection; economics; elective surgery; financial management; health service; hospital management; human; income; legislation and jurisprudence; management; pandemic; reimbursement; surgeon; United States; vascular surgery; virus pneumonia; Appointments and Schedules; Compensation and Redress; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Financing, Government; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Income; Insurance, Health, Reimbursement; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Policy Making; Surgeons; United States; Vascular Surgical Procedures COVID-19 and energy access: An opportunity or a challenge for the African continent? As the COVID-19 pandemic gains ground in the African continent, it will create havoc and unprecedented health and economic crisis. The crisis has exposed the robustness and resilience of the economies and services such as health systems around the world and it is disaster in the making while the pandemic is spreading fast to the African continent. This is alarming mainly because the continent has weak health system compounded by low access to modern and reliable electricity. It is also anticipated that the crisis will be brought ample opportunities and the African governments and the people should make coordinated and concerted effort in developing conducive business environment and exploit the opportunities presented to facilitate energy access focusing on clean and renewable energy technologies. This is a big test for the continent and thus it will either brought prosperity through facilitating universal energy access by effectively utilizing the opportunities brought by the crisis or the lack of energy access will continue affecting communities the ability to improve their livelihoods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Challenges; COVID-19; Energy access; Opportunities  Effective immune functions of micronutrients against sars-CoV-2 The third coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades has caused significant damage to the world’s economy and community health. The highly contagious COVID-19 infection has affected millions of people to date and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Aside from the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of a treatment or vaccine has been the main reason for its spread. Thus, it has become necessary to find alternative methods for controlling SARS-CoV-2. For the present review, we conducted an online search for different available nutrition-based therapies for previously known coronavirus infections and RNA-based virus infections as well as general antiviral therapies. These treatments have promise for combating COVID-19, as various nutrients and minerals play direct and indirect roles in the control and prevention of this newly emerged viral infection. The patients’ nutritional status with COVID-19 must be analyzed before administering any treatment, and nutritional supplements should be given to the affected individuals along with routine treatment. We suggest a potential interventional role of nutrients to strengthen the immune system against the emerging infection caused by COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Despite the great effort put in the development of vaccines and specific treatments, no prophylaxis or effective therapeutics are currently available. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and a potent vasodilator that has proved to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV replication and hypoxia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Given the potential of NO as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of NO on SARS-CoV-2 replication. The NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) had a dose dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, while the non S-nitrosated NAP was not active, as expected. Although the viral replication was not completely abolished (at 200 μM and 400 μM), SNAP delayed or completely prevented the development of viral cytopathic effect in treated cells, and the observed protective effect correlated with the level of inhibition of the viral replication. The capacity of the NO released from SNAP to covalently bind and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL recombinant protease in vitro was also tested. The observed reduction in SARS-CoV-2 protease activity was consistent with S-nitrosation of the enzyme active site cysteine. © 2020 The Author(s) 3CL protease; COVID-19; FRET; Nitric oxide; SARS-CoV-2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent; cysteine; n acetyl s nitrosopenicillamine; nitric oxide; proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; recombinant enzyme; antiviral activity; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytopathogenic effect; drug protein binding; enzyme active site; enzyme inhibition; in vitro study; nonhuman; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus replication Toward a diversified economy in post-pandemic environment: regeneration of Qatari villages Purpose: This paper aims to explore the possibilities of economic diversification in the State of Qatar through the regeneration of built heritage post the COVID-19 pandemic, promoting sustainable tourism and creating a center for cultural heritage in Qatar, thereby enhancing the sense of identity both socially and physically among the nationals and residents. In light of the strategic goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030, which is to diversify Qatar’s economy and minimize its reliance on hydrocarbon industries, if these ambitious goals are to be achieved, there is a necessity to maintain the local cultural identity, demonstrated through architecture and urbanism. Design/methodology/approach: This study is an exploratory research based on qualitative methods of data gathering and investigation. The local communities who used to live in the scattered old villages were approached with surveys. At the same time, semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals in the field in Qatar and other individuals from the public, depending on their literacy levels. Findings: This paper examines how to revive those villages and improve their current economic level. Finally, the study proposes some recommendations for these abandoned villages in an attempt to rejuvenate their built heritage and revitalize their socioeconomic status. Originality/value: Economic diversification needs to be engendered through the services and products of Qatari society; this is possible by exploiting current resources such as the built heritage or historic sites in areas outside the emerging metropolitan cities. This study reveals the great potential of regenerating the old villages of the Gulf States by establishing nonprofit organizations and increasing the economic benefit of the abandoned historic structures. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology — WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology — one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations. © 2020 Covid-19; Epidemiology; Pandemic; SARSCoV-2; Sewage; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) Diagnosis; Food supply; Network security; Public health; Sewage; Chemical signatures; Clinical diagnostics; Diagnostic testing; Environmental scientists; Financial institution; Large-scale applications; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Therapeutic treatments; Diseases; COVID-19; epidemic; epidemiology; future prospect; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage; viral disease; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease surveillance; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; epidemiological monitoring; human; international cooperation; mass screening; medical research; nonhuman; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; public health; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; waste water; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; virology; virus pneumonia; waste water; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Waste Water Strategies for Targeting SARS CoV-2: Small Molecule Inhibitors—The Current Status Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19) cases have been increasing at an alarming rate (7.4 million positive cases as on June 11 2020), causing high mortality (4,17,956 deaths as on June 11 2020) and economic loss (a 3.2% shrink in global economy in 2020) across 212 countries globally. The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs. © Copyright © 2020 Beeraka, Sadhu, Madhunapantula, Rao Pragada, Svistunov, Nikolenko, Mikhaleva and Aliev.

It is indicated by the reputed organizations and medical fraternity that corona will stay here for a longer period contrary to the earlier assumptions. Hence the purpose of this study is to suggest a strategy which balances both preventive measures and economic losses to control the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: There is a need for the identification of the critical success factors (CSFs) for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies to control the pandemic with an economy-centric approach. Findings: The six CSFs identified are “Effective communication”, “Social distancing”, “Adopting new technology”, “Modify the rules and regulation at workplace”, “Sealing the borders of the territory” and “Strong leadership and government control”. Research limitations/implications: The study has a vital contribution to literature as no previous study has identified CSFs for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies while focusing on the economy. Practical implications: Further, these identified CSFs are helpful in medium and longer-term planning which is required to rebalance and re-energize the economy following this epidemic crisis. Originality/value: The study has given a model that depicts the cause and influence relationship between the key factors in the system under question. The importance of study increases many fold, as resources are limited and the outcome of the study could be used to channelize the resources effectively. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines against future pathogens. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Sartorius, D’Apice, Manco and De Berardinis. antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19; emerging infectious diseases; epidemics; pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; vaccines; viruses bacterial vaccine; CD47 antigen; DNA vaccine; hemagglutinin; hepatitis B surface antigen; live vaccine; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; subunit vaccine; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; inactivated vaccine; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody response; avian influenza (H5N1); cross reaction; cytokine production; dendritic cell; dengue; Dengue virus; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; gene expression; health care personnel; hepatitis E; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; innate immunity; Lassa fever; liver injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Review; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; SARS coronavirus; vaccination; virus infection; virus neutralization; virus particle; West Nile fever; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vaccines, DNA; Vaccines, Inactivated; Vaccines, Subunit; Viral Vaccines Stock market reactions to COVID-19 pandemic outbreak: Quantitative evidence from ARDL bounds tests and granger causality analysis This paper examines the linkages in financial markets during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak. For this purpose, daily stock market returns were used over the period of December 31, 2019–April 20, 2020 for the following economies: USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, China, and Romania. The study applied the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to explore whether the Romanian stock market is impacted by the crisis generated by novel coronavirus. Granger causality was employed to investigate the causalities among COVID-19 and stock market returns, as well as between pandemic measures and several commodities. The outcomes of the ARDL approach failed to find evidence towards the impact of Chinese COVID-19 records on the Romanian financial market, neither in the short-term, nor in the long-term. On the other hand, our quantitative approach reveals a negative effect of the new deaths’ cases from Italy on the 10-year Romanian bond yield both in the short-run and long-run. The econometric research provide evidence that Romanian 10-year government bond is more sensitive to the news related to COVID-19 than the index of the Bucharest Stock Exchange.

Yet, with two important international legal cases underway at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court there are now important opportunities to maintain pressure on Myanmar’s government. Myanmar’s current government–a fusion of militarist, democratic, ethno-nationalist and conservative interests–has consistently sought to downplay the seriousness of the situation. This attitude, and the fraught, but politically effective, nexus between Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) and the military, has done much to encourage a culture of impunity among military and civilian decision-makers. Nevertheless, with crucial national elections scheduled for November 2020, and an economy battered by the global COVID-19 shutdown, Myanmar faces a confluence of grave challenges. Under these conditions, key decision-makers in Naypyitaw may hope that international scrutiny of violence against the Rohingya will fade. Given these court actions, however, this is unlikely. Whatever sympathy we may have for Aung San Suu Kyi’s predicament, she will not recover her reputation. And she will forever face hard questions about her inability to prevent, and, more importantly, refusal to condemn, ethnic cleansing. © 2020 Australian Institute of International Affairs. accountability; Aung San Suu Kyi; genocide; International Court of Justice; Myanmar; Rohingya accountability; culture; ethnic cleansing; ethnic group; genocide; Myanmar Let us unite against COVID-19 - A New Zealand perspective Novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has shaken the existence of mankind worldwide, including that of New Zealand. In comparison to other countries, New Zealand has had a very low number of confirmed and probable cases as well as COVID-19-related deaths. New Zealand closed its borders and rapidly declared a stringent lockdown to eliminate COVID-19. The country's 'go hard, go early' policy serves as an exemplar for the rest of the world to date. The mysterious nature of COVID-19 has caused tremendous stress and uncertainty leading to universal conflict between public health and state economy. Mental health services and non-government organisations have been proactive in the fight against COVID-19. Though there has been no significant rise in referrals to secondary mental health services to date (4 May 2020), a rapid surge in mental health presentations is widely anticipated. Telehealth may prove to be an efficient and cost-effective tool for the provision of future health services. © The Author(s), 2020.

Swenson. Lower incidence of COVID-19 at high altitude: Facts and confounders. High Alt Med Biol. 21:217-222, 2020. - The rapid transmission, increased morbidity, and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exhausted many health care systems and the global economy. Large variations in COVID-19 prevalence and incidence have been reported across and within many countries worldwide; however, this remains poorly understood. The variability and susceptibility across the world have been mainly attributed to differing socioeconomic status, burden of chronic diseases, access to health care, strength of health care systems, and early or late adoption of control measures. Environmental factors such as pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns at different latitudes may influence how severe the pandemic is and the incidence of infection in any part of the world. In addition, recent epidemiological data have been used to propose that altitude of residence may not only influence those environmental features considered key to lesser viral transmission, but also susceptibility to more severe forms of COVID-19 through hypoxic-hypobaria driven genomic or nongenomic adaptations specific to high-altitude populations. In this review, we critically examine these factors and attempt to determine based upon available scientific and epidemiological data whether living in high-altitude regions might be protective against COVID-19 as recent publications have claimed. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

This pandemic has affected physical health as well as mental health adversely. Several recent evidence suggests that health systems across the world have to improve their preparedness in context to infectious pandemics. The research on mental health aspects of COVID-19 and other related pandemics is lacking due to obvious reasons. This narrative review article, along with our personal views, is on various current and future mental health issues in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on various challenges and suggested solutions. The aim is also to update mental health strategies in the context of such rapidly spreading contagious illness, which can act as a resource for such a situation, currently and in future. We recommend that there is a need to facilitate mental health research to understand the psychiatric aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, include psychiatrists in the task force, and make available psychotropic and other medications with special attention to the deprived sector of the society. © 2020 Indian Journal of Psychiatry Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow. COVID-19; mental health; pandemic  Healthcare at the time of COVID-19: A review of the current situation with emphasis on anesthesia providers Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly around the world with devastating consequences on patients, healthcare workers, health systems, as well as economies. While, healthcare systems are globally operating at maximum capacity, healthcare workers and especially anesthesia providers are facing extreme pressures, something that is also leading to declining availability and increasing stress. In this regard, it is extremely concerning the fact that some regions worldwide have reported up to 20% of their cases to be healthcare workers. When considering that the global case fatality rate may be as much as 5.4%, these numbers are concerning and unacceptable. As this pandemic accelerates, access to personal protective equipment for health workers is a key concern since at present, healthcare workers are every country's most valuable resource in the fight against COVID-19. Governments and heath organizations should take care of their staff and support them in any way possible. This review aims to describe the current situation anesthesia providers are facing in the setting of COVID-19 and provide solutions and evidence on important concerns, including which guidance to follow, the level of equipment that is adequate, and the level of protection they need for every patient being administered an anesthetic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd anesthesiologist; COVID-19; critical care; nurse anesthetist; personal protective equipment anesthesia; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; health care; health care personnel; human; information dissemination; medical staff; mortality; priority journal; recovery room; Review; surgery; systematic review; virus load; virus transmission; anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care personnel; pandemic; procedures; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral Impact of COVID-19 on the level of energy poverty in Poland The main objective of the paper is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of energy poverty in Poland. In order to achieve such a goal, the first part of the article presents the definition of energy poverty and the nature of its measures, as well as the determinants and policies of the state addressing the issue of energy poverty mitigation. In the second part of the paper, the results of research into the level of energy poverty are analyzed and the variables affecting energy poverty in Poland during the pandemic are determined. It was established on the basis of these results that the present pandemic contributed to the aggravation of financial difficulties in Polish households with regard to financing expenditure on energy carriers. It was found that COVID-19 had a negative impact on the average disposable income of Polish households, which, with the increase in prices and expenditure on energy carriers, led to an increase in the proportion of disposable income spent on energy carriers. The most affected have been the poorest households. Moreover, the long downward trend in the level of energy poverty in Poland has reversed. Thus, it has been proved that COVID-19 has contributed to the intensification of energy poverty in Poland. The theoretical and empirical considerations contained in this paper may be a valuable source of scientific data on the impact of the pandemic on household energy poverty, while public institutions may find them a source of useful information, helping to create effective instruments to mitigate energy poverty in the Polish economy. © 2020 by the authors.

There is much pressure to develop both preventative and curative therapies for SARS-CoV-2 as there is no evidence to support therapies to improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Medications that inhibit certain steps of virus life cycle that are currently used to treat other illnesses such as Malaria, Ebola, HIV and Hepatitis C are being studied for use against SARS-CoV-2. To date, data is limited for medications that facilitate clinical improvement of COVID-19 infections. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 2019-nCoV; acetazolamide; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); autoimmune; camostat mesylate; chloroquine; COVID-19; high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE); hydroxychloroquine; Lopinavir/Ritonavir; novel coronavirus 2019; pandemic; Remdesivir; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors; SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV); SARS CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Umifenovir adenosine phosphate; alanine; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; camostat; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; gabexate; hydroxychloroquine; indole derivative; lopinavir; lopinavir-ritonavir drug combination; monoclonal antibody; remdesivir; ritonavir; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; tocilizumab; umifenovir; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; drug combination; drug effect; drug repositioning; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; immunology; pandemic; pathogenicity; virology; virus pneumonia; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Drug Combinations; Drug Repositioning; Gabexate; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Indoles; Lopinavir; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Ritonavir; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus Investigating the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India under lockdown In this paper, we investigate the ongoing dynamics of COVID-19 in India after its emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019. We discuss the effect of nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020. We also predict a 7 to 21% increase in the peak value of active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd  Public health; Control strategies; Global threats; Peak values; Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered; Wuhan , China; Health risks Is COVID-19 the end of US hegemony? Public bads, leadership failures and monetary hegemony COVID-19 is the most invasive global crisis in the postwar era, jeopardizing all dimensions of human activity. By theorizing COVID-19 as a public bad, I shed light on one of the great debates of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries regarding the relationship between the United States and liberal international order (LIO). Conceptualizing the pandemic as a public bad, I analyze its consequences for US hegemony. Unlike other international public bads and many of the most important public goods that make up the LIO, the COVID-19 public bad not only has some degree of rivalry but can be made partially excludable, transforming it into more of a club good. Domestically, I demonstrate how the failure to effectively manage the COVID-19 public bad has compromised America's ability to secure the health of its citizens and the domestic economy, the very foundations for its international leadership. These failures jeopardize US provision of other global public goods. Internationally, I show how the US has already used the crisis strategically to reinforce its opposition to free international movement while abandoning the primary international institution tasked with fighting the public bad, the World Health Organization (WHO). While the only area where the United States has exercised leadership is in the monetary sphere, I argue this feat is more consequential for maintaining hegemony. However, even monetary hegemony could be at risk if the pandemic continues to be mismanaged. © The Author(s) 2020.   Weathering the pandemic: How the Caribbean Basin can use viral and environmental patterns to predict, prepare, and respond to COVID-19 The 2020 coronavirus pandemic is developing at different paces throughout the world. Some areas, like the Caribbean Basin, have yet to see the virus strike at full force. When it does, there is reasonable evidence to suggest the consequent COVID-19 outbreaks will overwhelm healthcare systems and economies. This is particularly concerning in the Caribbean as pandemics can have disproportionately higher mortality impacts on lower and middle-income countries. Preliminary observations from our team and others suggest that temperature and climatological factors could influence the spread of this novel coronavirus, making spatiotemporal predictions of its infectiousness possible. This review studies geographic and time-based distribution of known respiratory viruses in the Caribbean Basin in an attempt to foresee how the pandemic will develop in this region. This review is meant to aid in planning short- and long-term interventions to manage outbreaks at the international, national, and subnational levels in the region. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC coronavirus; pandemic; seasonal incidence air temperature; Caribbean; coronavirus disease 2019; disease predisposition; disease transmission; environmental factor; epidemic; geographic distribution; health care planning; health care system; human; infection prevention; nonhuman; pandemic; prediction; Review; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; weathering Measuring the Economic Risk of COVID-19 We measure the economic risk of COVID-19 at a geo-spatially detailed resolution. In addition to data about the current prevalence of confirmed cases, we use data from 2014–2018 and a conceptual disaster risk model to compute measures for exposure, vulnerability, and resilience of the local economy to the shock of the epidemic. Using a battery of proxies for these four concepts, we calculate the hazard, the principal components of exposure and vulnerability to it, and of the economy’s resilience (i.e. its ability of the recover rapidly from the shock). We find that the economic risk of this pandemic is particularly high in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. These results are consistent when comparing an ad hoc equal weighting algorithm for the four components of the index, an algorithm that assumes equal hazard for all countries, and one based on estimated weights using previous aggregated disability-adjusted life years losses associated with communicable diseases. © 2020 University of Durham and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd   Vaccine development against coronavirus (2003 to present): An overview, recent advances, current scenario, opportunities and challenges Background and aim: The pandemic COVID-19 occurring due to novel emerging coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is severely affecting the worldwide public health, culture, economy and human social behaviour. Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine. Method: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: In conclusion, we discuss possible clues/ target sites for designing of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus based on prior-art. © 2020 Diabetes India Adjuvants; Antigens; Coronavirus disease vaccine; COVID-19 vaccine; Spike protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Coronavirus vaccine; DNA vaccine; immunological adjuvant; inactivated vaccine; live vaccine; nanomaterial; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; virus antigen; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; animal model; Article; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug repositioning; human; infection control; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; protein subunit; SARS coronavirus; scale up; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; vaccine production; virus genome; virus mutation; virus virulence; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; immunology; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Viral Vaccines Antiviral potential of nanoparticles—can nanoparticles fight against coronaviruses? Infectious diseases account for more than 20% of global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths. Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is having serious consequences on health and the economy worldwide. All evidence-based treatment strategies need to be considered to combat this new virus. Drugs need to be considered on scientific grounds of efficacy, safety and cost. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old drugs used in the treatment of malaria. Moreover, their antiviral properties have been previously studied, including against coronaviruses, where evidence of efficacy has been found. In the current race against time triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the search for new antivirals is very important. However, consideration should be given to old drugs with known anti-coronavirus activity, such as CQ and HCQ. These could be integrated into current treatment strategies while novel treatments are awaited, also in light of the fact that they display an anticoagulant effect that facilitates the activity of low-molecular-weight heparin, aimed at preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-associated thrombotic events. The safety of CQ and HCQ has been studied for over 50 years, however recently published data raise concerns for cardiac toxicity of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19. This review also re-examines the real information provided by some of the published alarming reports, although concluding that cardiac toxicity should in any case be stringently monitored in patients receiving CQ/HCQ. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Antiviral; Chloroquine; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2; chloroquine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glycoprotein gp 120; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; papain; papain like protease; quinone reductase 2; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone); tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anticoagulant agent; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; chloroquine; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxychloroquine; immunologic factor; anticoagulation; antiviral activity; Article; autophagy (cellular); avian influenza (H5N1); CD4+ T lymphocyte; disease severity; drug blood level; drug distribution; drug half life; drug mechanism; enzyme inhibition; human; immunomodulation; immunopathogenesis; in vitro study; in vivo study; molecular docking; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein expression; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection; trans Golgi network; virus neutralization; virus replication; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; disseminated intravascular clotting; drug effect; genetics; growth, development and aging; host pathogen interaction; immunology; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anticoagulants; Antiviral Agents; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunologic Factors; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication Genotyping coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: methods and implications The emerging global infectious COVID-19 disease by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late December 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. 2019-nCoV; COVID-19; Genotyping; SARS-CoV-2; Single-nucleotide polymorphism nucleoprotein; protein RNA primase; RNA polymerase; unclassified drug; viral protein; vitronectin; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; epidemic; gene isolation; gene location; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic variation; genotype; human; infection control; nonhuman; pathogenicity; priority journal; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single nucleotide polymorphism; vaccine production; virus isolation; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; genomics; genotyping technique; molecular evolution; mutation; pandemic; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; virus genome; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Viral; Genomics; Genotyping Techniques; Humans; Mutation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Alignment Plants-derived biomolecules as potent antiviral phytomedicines: New insights on ethnobotanical evidences against coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is in focus over all known human diseases, because it is destroying the world economy and social life, with increased mortality rate each day. To date, there is no specific medicine or vaccine available against this pandemic disease. However, the presence of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules with antiviral properties might also be a successful strategy in order to develop therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this review will summarize the available literature and other information/data sources related to antiviral medicinal plants, with possible ethnobotanical evidence in correlation with coronaviruses. The identification of novel antiviral compounds is of critical significance, and medicinal plant based natural compounds are a good source for such discoveries. In depth search and analysis revealed several medicinal plants with excellent efficacy against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which are well-known to act on ACE-2 receptor, 3CLpro and other viral protein targets. In this review, we have consolidated the data of several medicinal plants and their natural bioactive metabolites, which have promising antiviral activities against coronaviruses with detailed modes of action/mechanism. It is concluded that this review will be useful for researchers worldwide and highly recommended for the development of naturally safe and effective therapeutic drugs/agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be used in therapeutic protocols alone or in combination with chemically synthetized drugs. © 2020, MDPI AG.

The COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be an enormous challenge to the health of the world population with tremendous consequences for the world economy. New knowledge about COVID-19 is being acquired continuously. Although the main manifestation of COVID-19 is SARS, dysfunction in other organs has been described in the last months. Neurological aspects of COVID-19 are still an underreported subject. However, a plethora of previous studies has shown that human CoVs might be neurotropic, neuroinvasive, and neurovirulent, highlighting the importance of this knowledge by physicians. Besides, several neurological manifestations had been described as complications of two other previous outbreaks of CoV diseases (SARS ad Middle East respiratory syndrome). Therefore, we should be watchful, searching for early evidence of neurological insults and promoting clinical protocols to investigate them. Our objectives are to review the potential neuropathogenesis of this new CoV and the neurological profile of COVID-19 patients described so far. © 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene  immunoglobulin; cerebrovascular accident; coronavirus disease 2019; cranial neuropathy; frontal lobe; Guillain Barre syndrome; human; necrotizing encephalopathy; nervous system; neurologic disease; neuropathology; nonhuman; respiratory virus; Review; SARS coronavirus; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smelling disorder; taste disorder; thrombosis; virus entry; virus genome; virus morphology; virus particle; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral How many jobs can be done at home? Evaluating the economic impact of “social distancing” measures taken to arrest the spread of COVID-19 raises a fundamental question about the modern economy: how many jobs can be performed at home? We classify the feasibility of working at home for all occupations and merge this classification with occupational employment counts. We find that 37% of jobs in the United States can be performed entirely at home, with significant variation across cities and industries. These jobs typically pay more than jobs that cannot be done at home and account for 46% of all US wages. Applying our occupational classification to 85 other countries reveals that lower-income economies have a lower share of jobs that can be done at home. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China. To reduce the case-fatality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, we should not ignore the complications, such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, and chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation based on available evidence. As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. coronavirus; COVID-19; literature review; pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2; treatment chloroquine; corticosteroid; placebo; remdesivir; ribavirin; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiviral therapy; avascular necrosis; cardiotoxicity; case fatality rate; continuous hemofiltration; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; diabetes mellitus; drug accumulation; drug blood level; drug mechanism; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; extracorporeal oxygenation; hemolytic anemia; hemorrhagic fever; human; influenza A (H7N9); liver failure; malaria; Middle East respiratory syndrome; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; plasma exchange; psychosis; retinopathy; Review; secondary infection; severe acute respiratory syndrome; unspecified side effect Recent progress in plasmonic biosensing schemes for virus detection The global burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to public health and global economy has stressed the need for rapid and simple diagnostic methods. From this perspective, plasmonic-based biosensing can manage the threat of infectious diseases by providing timely virus monitoring. In recent years, many plasmonics’ platforms have embraced the challenge of offering on-site strategies to complement traditional diagnostic methods relying on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This review compiled recent progress on the development of novel plasmonic sensing schemes for the effective control of virus-related diseases. A special focus was set on the utilization of plasmonic nanostructures in combination with other detection formats involving colorimetric, fluorescence, luminescence, or Raman scattering enhancement. The quantification of different viruses (e.g., hepatitis virus, influenza virus, norovirus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus) with particular attention to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reviewed from the perspective of the biomarker and the biological receptor immobilized on the sensor chip. Technological limitations including selectivity, stability, and monitoring in biological matrices were also reviewed for different plasmonic-sensing approaches. © 2020 by the author.

The consequences from the pandemic are devastating, not only for human health and the national health systems throughout the world, but also for the global economy. Bats, pangolins, muskrats and other wild animals have been implicated as possible hosts of the virus. According to recent research data, the increased concentration of particulate air matter in the atmosphere appears to have contributed significantly to the spread (airborne transmission) and aggressiveness of the disease, as large cities with high levels of air pollution showed the highest numbers of SARS-CoV2 cases and deaths. It also appears that the collapse of natural ecosystems resulting from the ever-evolving climate change has been crucial for the migration of animals to new areas and their interaction with other animals that they would not normally encounter, resulting in the emergence of new pathogens, which in turn infected humans. It is now clear that the era of “climate medicine” which will be a cornerstone for the practice of medicine in the 21st century, has already begun. © Athens Medical Society.

Based upon current researches, this virus is spreading from one human to another through respiratory droplets, i.e. cough and sneeze. Till now, there has not been any specific treatment found for this virus. Hence, there is a critical need to discover alternative techniques to cope with the current scenario. Recent Findings: This review conducted an online search for prevention of coronavirus infection with the help of nutritional interventions. It has been observed that the effect of the virus is mostly on the individual with low immunity, individual affected with diseases like diabetes, and individual using any immune-suppressed drug or having past history of major surgeries or severe medical conditions. Summary: Therefore, consuming foods which boost immunity helps in preventing respiratory-related disorder or suppressing diseases-related problems, which could be helpful in controlling the spread of this virus. In conclusion, it has been suggested that before the beginning of generalised treatments and interventions in each infected patient, nutritional status should be evaluated, as it can help in creating a specific nutrition intervention for the infected individual. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Because approved drugs and vaccines are limited or not available, new options for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are in high demand. To identify SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, we analyzed the antibody response of 12 COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days after diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early as 8 days after diagnosis. Of these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC100 as low as 0.04 μg/mL, showing a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and low levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursor sequences were identified in naive B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals who were sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are readily generated from a diverse pool of precursors, fostering hope for rapid induction of a protective immune response upon vaccination. © 2020 The Author(s)In a longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected people, Kreer et al. find highly potent neutralizing antibodies that use a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and show low levels of somatic mutations. They also identify potential precursor sequences of these SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies from virus-naive individuals, sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. This could indicate that neutralizing antibodies can be readily generated from existing germline antibody sequences found in the general population. © 2020 The Author(s) 2019-nCoV; COVID-19; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2; single B cell analysis immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G1 antibody; neutralizing antibody; vitronectin; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; adult; antibody isolation; antibody response; antigen binding; Article; B lymphocyte; cell screening; cell selection; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; gene sequence; human; human cell; longitudinal study; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; somatic mutation; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; immunoglobulin variable region; immunological memory; immunology; isolation and purification; pandemic; somatic hypermutation; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; B-Lymphocytes; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunoglobulin Variable Region; Immunologic Memory; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin Communicable Diseases (Including COVID-19)—Induced Global Depression: Caused by Inadequate Healthcare Expenditures, Population Density, and Mass Panic Coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading at an enormous rate and has caused deaths beyond expectations due to a variety of reasons. These include: (i) inadequate healthcare spending causing, for instance, a shortage of protective equipment, testing swabs, masks, surgical gloves, gowns, etc.; (ii) a high population density that causes close physical contact among community members who reside in compact places, hence they are more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases, including coronavirus; and (iii) mass panic due to the fear of experiencing the loss of loved ones, lockdown, and shortage of food. In a given scenario, the study focused on the following key variables: communicable diseases, healthcare expenditures, population density, poverty, economic growth, and COVID-19 dummy variable in a panel of 76 selected countries from 2010 through 2019. The results show that the impact of communicable diseases on economic growth is positive because the infected countries get a reap of economic benefits from other countries in the form of healthcare technologies, knowledge transfers, cash transfers, international loans, aid, etc., to get rid of the diseases. However, the case is different with COVID-19 as it has seized the whole world together in a much shorter period of time and no other countries are able to help others in terms of funding loans, healthcare facilities, or technology transfers. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 in the given study is negatively impacting countries' economic growth that converts into a global depression. The high incidence of poverty and social closeness increases more vulnerable conditions that spread coronavirus across countries. The momentous increase in healthcare expenditures put a burden on countries' national healthcare bills that stretch the depression phase-out of the boundary. The forecasting relationship suggested the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy would last the next 10 years. Unified global healthcare policies, physical distancing, smart lockdowns, and meeting food challenges are largely required to combat the coronavirus pandemic and escape from global depression. © Copyright © 2020 Anser, Yousaf, Khan, Sheikh, Nassani, Abro and Zaman.

We find that the Chinese business and financial cycles over the short, medium, and long terms all are in, or close to, the contraction phase before the COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, the Chinese economy has decoupled from the global financial cycle since 2015. These results suggest that China may be better positioned than other emerging economies to win the war against the pandemic. However, extraordinary macroeconomic policies are still needed to mitigate the pandemic-induced economic meltdown. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. business cycle; COVID-19 pandemic; financial cycle; wavelet analysis  Household Financial Decision Making Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic This paper investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on household investment decisions using a novel survey conducted by the Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance. We use linear probability and probit models to analyze the effects of COVID-19 at the household level. Our results show that households who know someone infected with COVID-19 lose confidence in the economy. They are more likely to change their risk behavior and become risk-averse. Further, COVID-19 increases the probability that a household will change its investment portfolio. More specifically, it causes a 9.15% decrease in the total investment amount. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. coronavirus; COVID-19; Financial decision making; pandemic; risk behavior  The perceived impact of the Covid-19 epidemic: evidence from a sample of 4807 SMEs in Sichuan Province, China The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in January 2020 in Wuhan has had a significant impact on the Chinese economy, and especially on the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In February 2020 an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews were conducted on 4807 SMEs in Sichuan to assess the challenges associated with work resumption and the associated policy requirements. It was found that most SMEs were unable to resume work because of a shortage of epidemic mitigation materials, the inability of employees to return to work, disrupted supply chains, and reduced market demand. Many SMEs were also facing cash flow risks as they had to continue to pay for various fixed expenditures even though they had little or no revenue. As these delays in work resumption have put unprecedented pressures on the survival of many SMEs, recommendations relevant to China and other affected countries regarding cash flow relief, work resumption and consumption stimulation are given to assist SME survival and economic recovery from the disaster situation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Such a vaccine would need to rapidly confer protection after one or two doses and would need to be manufactured using components suitable for scale up. Here, we developed an Alphavirus-derived replicon RNA vaccine candidate, repRNA-CoV2S, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The RNA replicons were formulated with lipid inorganic nanoparticles (LIONs) that were designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery, and immunogenicity. We show that a single intramuscular injection of the LION/repRNA-CoV2S vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti–SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a type 1 T helper cell response. A prime/boost regimen induced potent T cell responses in mice including antigen-specific responses in the lung and spleen. Prime-only immunization of aged (17 months old) mice induced smaller immune responses compared to young mice, but this difference was abrogated by booster immunization. In nonhuman primates, prime-only immunization in one intramuscular injection site or prime/boost immunizations in five intramuscular injection sites elicited modest T cell responses and robust antibody responses. The antibody responses persisted for at least 70 days and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at titers comparable to those in human serum samples collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19. These data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved.

Since the beginning of 2020, this stability has been undergoing one of the most vigorous pressure tests ever due to the COVID-19 outbreak. From a mere health issue, the pandemic has turned into an economic threat to food security globally in the forms of lockdowns, economic decline, food trade restrictions, and rising food inflation. It is safe to assume that the novel health crisis has badly struck the least developed and developing economies, where people are particularly vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition. However, due to the recency of the COVID-19 problem, the impacts of macroeconomic fluctuations on food insecurity have remained scantily explored. In this study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing interactions between the food security status of people and the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, food trade, food inflation, and currency volatilities. The study was performed in the cases of 45 developing economies distributed to three groups by the level of income. The consecutive application of the autoregressive distributed lag method, Yamamoto’s causality test, and variance decomposition analysis allowed the authors to find the food insecurity effects of COVID-19 to be more perceptible in upper-middle-income economies than in the least developed countries. In the latter, food security risks attributed to the emergence of the health crisis were mainly related to economic access to adequate food supply (food inflation), whereas in higher-income developing economies, availability-sided food security risks (food trade restrictions and currency depreciation) were more prevalent. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip decision-makers with up-to-date estimations of health crisis effects on economic parameters of food availability and access to staples in food-insecure communities. © 2020 by the authors.

While distancing measures can safeguard public health, they also can profoundly impact the economy and may have important indirect effects on the environment. The extent to which physical distancing measures should be applied therefore depends on the trade-offs between their health benefits and their economic costs. We develop an epidemiological-economic model to examine the optimal duration and intensity of physical distancing measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. In an application to the United States, our model considers the trade-off between the lives saved by physical distancing—both directly from stemming the spread of the virus and indirectly from reductions in air pollution during the period of physical distancing—and the short- and long-run economic costs that ensue from such measures. We examine the effect of air pollution co-benefits on the optimal physical distancing policy and conduct sensitivity analyses to gauge the influence of several key parameters and uncertain model assumptions. Using recent estimates of the association between airborne particulate matter and the virulence of COVID-19, we find that accounting for air pollution co-benefits can significantly increase the intensity and duration of the optimal physical distancing policy. To conclude, we broaden our discussion to consider the possibility of durable changes in peoples’ behavior that could alter local markets, the global economy, and our relationship to nature for years to come. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

In a few weeks, it progressed rapidly into a global pandemic which resulted in an overwhelming burden on health care systems, medical resources and staff. Spine surgeons as health care providers are no exception. In this study, we try to highlight the impact of the crisis on spine surgeons in terms of knowledge, attitude, practice and socioeconomic burden. Methods: This was global, multicentric cross-sectional study on 781 spine surgeons that utilized an Internet-based validated questionnaire to evaluate knowledge about COVID-19, availability of personal protective equipment, future perceptions, effect of this crisis on practice and psychological distress. Univariate and multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictors for the degree of COVID-19 effect on practice. Results: Overall, 20.2%, 52% and 27.8% of the participants were affected minimally, intermediately and hugely by COVID-19, respectively. Older ages (β = 0.33, 95% CI 0.11–0.56), orthopedic spine surgeons (β = 0.30, 95% CI 0.01–0.61) and those who work in the private sector (β = 0.05, 95% CI 0.19–0.61) were the most affected by COVID-19. Those who work in university hospitals (β = − 0.36, 95% CI 0.00 to − 0.71) were affected the least. The availability of N95 masks (47%) and disposable eye protectors or face shields (39.4%) was significantly associated with lower psychological stress (p = 0.01). Only 6.9%, 3.7% and 5% had mild, moderate and severe mental distress, respectively. Conclusion: While it is important to recognize the short-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of spine surgery, predicting where we will be standing in 6–12 months remains difficult and unknown. The COVID-19 crisis will probably have an unexpected long-term impact on lives and economies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Unfortunately, there is not currently available vaccine for SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19. Various types of patients have delayed treatment or even routine check-ups and we are adapting to a virtual world. In many cases, surgeries are delayed unless they are essential. This is also true with regards to cancer treatments and screening. Interestingly, some existing drugs and nutraceuticals have been screened for their effects on COVID-19. Certain FDA approved drugs, vitamin, natural products and trace minerals may be repurposed to treat or improve the prevention of COVID-19 infections and disease progression. This review article will summarize how the treatments of various cancer patients has changed during the COVID-19 era as well as discuss the promise of some existing drugs and other agents to be repurposed to treat this disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Cancer; COVID-19; Natural products; Nutraceuticals; Repurposing approved drugs angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antineoplastic agent; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxychloroquine; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; trace element; vitamin; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; immunology; neoplasm; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; virology; virus pneumonia; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Trace Elements; Vitamins Building a Social Mandate for Climate Action: Lessons from COVID-19 The COVID-19 imposed lockdown has led to a number of temporary environmental side effects (reduced global emissions, cleaner air, less noise), that the climate community has aspired to achieve over a number of decades. However, these benefits have been achieved at a massive cost to welfare and the economy. This commentary draws lessons from the COVID-19 crisis for climate change. It discusses whether there are more sustainable ways of achieving these benefits, as part of a more desirable, low carbon resilient future, in a more planned, inclusive and less disruptive way. In order to achieve this, we argue for a clearer social contract between citizens and the state. We discuss how COVID-19 has demonstrated that behaviours can change abruptly, that these changes come at a cost, that we need a ‘social mandate’ to ensure these changes remain in the long-term, and that science plays an important role in informing this process. We suggest that deliberative engagement mechanisms, such as citizens’ assemblies and juries, could be a powerful way to build a social mandate for climate action post-COVID-19. This would enable behaviour changes to become more accepted, embedded and bearable in the long-term and provide the basis for future climate action. © 2020, The Author(s).

Governments at all levels in this nation responded. This analysis starts with a basic question: How did prior planning for pandemics shape responses? A second question emerges: why were data systems inadequate? Expectations, policies, and procedures focused on addressing influenza pandemics shaped responses to COVID-19. Crippled by inadequate data, federal experts did not fully understand likely impacts of COVID-19 until early March. Planned public health processes were overwhelmed by a surge in infections and deaths. Decision making planned to be responses by experts moved to elected officials. Needed data were provided by sources outside government. Governors in 42 states issued stay-at-home orders, causing severe dislocations in the economy and society at a scale never experienced before as the result of deliberate public policy choices. Possible improvements for the future are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

The trade in wild meat, and its role in diets, have been brought into focus as a consequence of discussions over the origins of COVID-19. As a result, there have been calls for the closure of China’s “wet markets”; greater scrutiny of the wildlife trade in general; and a spotlight has been placed on the potential risks posed by growing human populations and shrinking natural habitats for animal to human transmission of zoonotic diseases. However, to date there has been little attention given to what the consequences of the COVID-19 economic shock may be for the wildlife trade; the people who rely on it for their livelihoods; and the wildlife that is exploited. In this policy perspective, we argue that the links between the COVID-19 pandemic, rural livelihoods and wildlife are likely to be more complex, more nuanced, and more far-reaching, than is represented in the literature to date. We develop a causal model that tracks the likely implications for the wild meat trade of the systemic crisis triggered by COVID-19. We focus on the resulting economic shockwave, as manifested in the collapse in global demand for commodities such as oil, and international tourism services, and what this may mean for local African economies and livelihoods. We trace the shockwave through to the consequences for the use of, and demand for, wild meats as households respond to these changes. We suggest that understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of wild meat use requires increased collaboration between environmental and resource economics and the ecological and conservation sciences. © 2020, The Author(s).

A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. Results: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures. © 2020 by the authors.

Yet, few have provided a synthesis that examines how these factors relate to each other. This article fills this gap in the debate by comparing COVID-19 responses among five advanced economies in East Asia: Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan. Although agile actions and competence of top leadership are necessary to confront an unprecedented crisis, they are by themselves insufficient. Equally critical is whether a society has the necessary institutional infrastructure in place when a crisis strikes. Policy instruments are more likely to succeed when existing institutional infrastructure supports their administration and implementation. For an instrument to generate enduring impact, it must be compatible with a polity’s underlying culture; instruments that accommodate the underlying cultural orientations are more likely to elicit public cooperation and voluntary compliance over time. Policy instruments must also address equity issues by reaching marginalized groups across all layers of the population. Progress in emergency management may be visible in mainstream society but masking brewing problems among marginalized groups. A comparison across the five advanced economies in East Asia yields several implications for comparative research and policy. © The Author(s) 2020.

The virus has very high infectivity and is crippling in patients developing severe disease. The disease caused by this infective agent, a novel RNA coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 usually enters the human body from the respiratory tract and gradually causes systemic disease. The disease is mild in 81% and severe in the balance. The virus causes multiorgan damage and primarily damages airway epithelium, small intestine epithelium, and vascular endothelium, which are organs with high angiotensin-converting enzyme (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 [ACE2] expression). The most affected organ is the lungs, and the cardiovascular system follows it closely. Symptomatic hypoxic patients are initially treated with oxygen supplementation, but those with severe hypoxia need mechanical ventilation support. Patients with COVID-19 infection present as two phenotypes. The ventilation strategy should be based on the phenotype. The disease causes major hemodynamic disturbances in its invasion of the cardiovascular system. Strict personal protection protocols are needed to ensure the safety of health-care workers and nosocomial spread. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

For example, the extent to which social media platforms contribute to enhancing public health awareness and prevention during epidemic disease transmission is currently unknown. Doubtlessly, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents a great challenge at the global level, aggressively affecting large cities and public gatherings and thereby having substantial impacts on many health care systems worldwide as a result of its rapid spread. Each country has its capacity and reacts according to its perception of threat, economy, health care policy, and the health care system structure. Furthermore, we noted a lack of research focusing on the role of social media campaigns in public health awareness and public protection against the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan as a developing country. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of social media platforms on public health protection against the COVID-19 pandemic via public health awareness and public health behavioral changes as mediating factors in Jordan. Methods: A quantitative approach and several social media platforms were used to collect data via web questionnaires in Jordan, and a total of 2555 social media users were sampled. This study used structural equation modeling to analyze and verify the study variables. Results: The main findings revealed that the use of social media platforms had a significant positive influence on public health protection against COVID-19 as a pandemic. Public health awareness and public health behavioral changes significantly acted as partial mediators in this relationship. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of the use of social media interventions on public health protection against COVID-19 while taking public health awareness and behavioral changes into account as mediators should be helpful when developing any health promotion strategy plan. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the use of social media platforms can positively influence awareness of public health behavioral changes and public protection against COVID-19. Public health authorities may use social media platforms as an effective tool to increase public health awareness through dissemination of brief messages to targeted populations. However, more research is needed to validate how social media channels can be used to improve health knowledge and adoption of healthy behaviors in a cross-cultural context. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Since these restrictions have a negative impact on the economy, there exists a strong incentive to relax these policies while protecting public health. Using a modified SEIR epidemiological model, this paper explores the costs and benefits associated with the sequential release of specific groups based on age and risk from lockdown and social distancing measures. The results in this paper suggest that properly designed staggered-release policies can do better than simultaneous-release policies in terms of protecting the most vulnerable members of a population, reducing health risks overall, and increasing economic activity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

As the rate of infection starts to slow, healthcare facilities and economies attempt to return to normalcy in a graduated manner and the massive pent-up demand for surgeries needs to eventually be addressed in a systematic and equitable manner. Materials and methods: Guidelines from the Alliance of International Organizations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Orthopaedic Trauma Association, American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anaesthesiologists, Association of perioperative Registered Nurses, American Hospital Association, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were evaluated and summarized into a working framework, relevant to orthopaedic surgeons. Results: The guiding principles for restarting elective surgeries in a safe and acceptable manner include up-to-date disease awareness, projection and judicious management of equipment and facilities, effective human resource management, a fair and transparent system to prioritize cases, optimization of peri-operative workflows and continuous data gathering and clinical governance. Conclusion: The world was ill prepared for the initial COVID-19 outbreak. However, with effective forward planning, institutions can ramp-up elective surgical caseload in a safe and equitable manner. © 2020 IJS Publishing Group Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Elective surgery; Orthopaedic surgery; Pandemic anesthesiologist; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; elective surgery; health care facility; health workforce; human; international organization; medicaid; medical society; medicare; orthopedic surgeon; orthopedic surgery; pandemic; perioperative period; practice guideline; priority journal; public health service; registered nurse; resource management; Review; traumatology; World Health Organization; anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; organization and management; orthopedic surgery; orthopedics; perioperative nursing; personnel management; procedures; United States; virus pneumonia; workflow; American Hospital Association; Anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Medicare; Orthopedic Procedures; Orthopedics; Pandemics; Perioperative Nursing; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Societies, Medical; Traumatology; United States; Workflow; World Health Organization Newly emerging human coronaviruses: Animal models and vaccine research for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 The recent emergence of the novel coronavirus (CoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global threat to human health and economy. As of June 26, 2020, over 9.4 million cases of infection, including 482,730 deaths, had been confirmed across 216 countries. To combat a devastating virus pandemic, numerous studies on vaccine development are urgently being accelerated. In this review article, we take a brief look at the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoVs and discuss recent approaches to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development. © 2020.

However, if you are a graduating trainee confronted with this unusual set of circumstances, fear of the virus is not the only thing that is foremost in your mind. We discuss the unique challenges our pain fellowship program continues to deal with during this pandemic and particularly its impact on our fellows. It is entirely likely these concerns are mirrored in academic programs all over the United States. © 2020, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. All rights reserved.

As the world is struggling to minimize the transmission of this devastating disease, several strategies are being actively deployed to develop therapeutic interventions. Pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers are relentlessly working to investigate experimental, repurposed or FDA-approved drugs on a compassionate basis and novel biologics for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and treatment. Presently, a tremendous surge of COVID-19 clinical trials are advancing through different stages. Among currently registered clinical efforts, ~86% are centered on testing small molecules or antibodies either alone or in combination with immunomodulators. The rest ~14% of clinical efforts are aimed at evaluating vaccines and convalescent plasma-based therapies to mitigate the disease's symptoms. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic modalities being evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Methods: A survey with 12 questions was shared with all IDF-SACA member organizations, in 18 countries. A descriptive analysis was performed and a multivariate cluster analysis technique pam (partitioning around medoids) was applied. Results: Two groups of countries were identified. The first group, mostly countries with stricter measures to contain the spread of the virus, reported more difficulties (limitations in accessing basic or health needs) and fears (concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic); whereas most of the second group consisted of countries with less restrictive measures, and reported fewer difficulties. Only 37% responded that a policy was put into place to protect individuals with diabetes, either delivering their medicines and supplies at home (16%) or providing them at once enough for 2–3 months (21%). All respondents reported that one of the main fear was to “be infected and not to receive adequate treatment” and/or “getting infected if going to the hospital or medical appointments”. Conclusion: Most of the SACA countries failed to implement timely measures to protect individuals with diabetes, which may severely impact individuals, health systems and economies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Barring the essential services, most of the business activities and transport sectors have been suspended and an unprecedented lockdown imposed over major economies in the world. South-East Asian regions, such as India and China, were no different. As a result, the pollutant level has gone down over these regions, and the air quality improved somewhat better than it was before the lockdown. This study uses satellite retrievals and attempts to estimate the extent of the reduction of major pollutants, like carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in India and China during January to April, 2020. We have calculated anomalies of pollutants during the lockdown period relative to their long-term records. NO2, which has significant emissions from the transport sector, is reduced on an average by 17% over India and 25% over China. SO2, which mainly emits from power plants, shows significant reductions (approx. 17%) especially over the Eastern sector of India. CO is found to be reduced by 6.5% over north-central China. The differential reduction was attributed to man made versus natural activities. This study is helpful to policy makers in mitigating the air-pollution on a long-term perspective. © The Author(s).

We provide insight on the impact that health care restriction has made on neurosurgical activity in Latin Iberoamerica. Methods: We performed an internet-based survey among presidents and members of the societies of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC). We blindly analyzed information regarding local conditions and their impact on neurosurgical praxis using SPSS software. Results: Information came from 21 countries. Sixteen society presidents reported having suspended regular activities and deferring local scheduled congresses, 14 reported mandatory isolation by government, and 4 instituted a telemedicine project. Four-hundred eighty-six colleagues, mean age 49 years, reported a mean 79% reduction in their neurosurgical praxis. Seventy-six percent of neurosurgeons have savings to self-support for 3–6 months if restrictions are long lasting. Conclusions: Stopping activities among societies of the FLANC, together with a drop of 79% of neurosurgical praxis, adds to deficits in provider's protection equipment and increasing demand for attention in the health care systems, representing a huge financial risk to their sustainability. Neurosurgeons should be involved in local policies to protect health and economy. Telemedicine represents an excellent solution, avoiding another pandemic of severe diseases across all-specialties as nonessential care can turn essential if left untreated. Financial support and ethics code review is needed to battle this new disease, designated the occupational disease of the decade, that continues to scrag the health care system. Times of crisis are times of great opportunities for humanity to evolve. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Many mathematical epidemiological models have been tried for the available data of the COVID-19 pandemic with the core objective to observe the trend and trajectories of infected cases, recoveries, and deaths, etc. However, these models have their own assumptions and parameters and vary with regional demography. This article suggests the use of a more pragmatic approach of the Kalman filter with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models in order to obtain more precise forecasts for the figures of prevalence, active cases, recoveries, and deaths related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. © 2020 The Author(s) Arima model; COVID-2019 pandemic; Forecast; Holt-winters’ method; Infection control; Kalman filter; State space model; SutteARIMA  Greening the Post-pandemic Recovery in the G20 Rebuilding G20 economies after the COVID-19 pandemic requires rethinking what type of economy we need and want in the future. Simply reviving the existing ‘brown’ economy will exacerbate irreversible climate change and other environmental risks. For G20 economies, investing in a workable and affordable green transition is essential. A good place to start is learning what worked and what did not from previous efforts to green the economic recovery during the 2008–2009 Great Recession, examining the cases of the United States and South Korea. Policies for a sustained economic recovery amount to much more than just short-term fiscal stimulus. Transitioning from fossil fuels to a sustainable low-carbon economy will require long-term commitments (5–10 years) of public spending and pricing reforms. The priorities for public spending include support for private sector green innovation and infrastructure, development of smart grids, transport systems, charging station networks, and sustainable cities. Pricing carbon and pollution, and removing fossil-fuel subsidies, can accelerate the transition, raise revenues for the necessary public investments, and lower the overall cost of the green transition. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Its rapid transmissibility has transformed healthcare delivery and forced countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. The vast majority of the United States cardiac surgical programs have deferred all but truly emergent/urgent operative procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the healthcare system and to mobilize resources to combat the pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, the incidence of new cases has begun to decline in many North American cities. This “flattening of the curve” has prompted interest in reopening the economy, relaxing public health restrictions, and resuming nonurgent healthcare delivery. The following document provides a template whereby adult cardiac surgical programs may begin to ramp-up the care delivery in a deliberate and graded fashion as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease. “Resuscitating” the timely delivery of care is guided by three principles: (1) Collaborate to permit increased case volumes, balancing the clinical needs of patients awaiting surgical procedures with the local resources available within each healthcare system. (2) Prioritize patients awaiting elective procedures while proactively engaging all stakeholders, focusing on those with high-risk anatomy, changing/symptomatic clinical status, and, once these variables have been addressed, prioritizing by waiting times. (3) Reevaluate local conditions continuously to assess for any increase in admissions due to a recrudescence of cases, to assure adequate resources to care for patients, and to monitor in-hospital infectious transmissions to both patients and healthcare workers. © 2020 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons  ageusia; anosmia; aortic stenosis; Article; cardiac surgeon; cardiovascular disease; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery disease; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; elective surgery; emergency surgery; extracorporeal oxygenation; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care system; heart surgery; heart transplantation; hospital admission; hospital care; hospital patient; human; pandemic; practice guideline; priority journal; screening test; thoracic surgeon; transcatheter aortic valve implantation; United States; advisory committee; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; heart surgery; organization and management; surgeon; thorax surgery; virus pneumonia; Advisory Committees; Betacoronavirus; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surgeons; Thoracic Surgery Mask or no mask for COVID-19: A public health and market study Efficient strategies to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are peremptory to relieve the negatively impacted public health and global economy, with the full scope yet to unfold. In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies. © 2020 Li et al.

The model distinguishes four stages in the disease: infected, sick, seriously sick, and better. The model was preliminarily parameterized based on observations of the spread of the disease. The model assumes a case mortality rate of 1.5%. Preliminary simulations with the model indicate that concepts such as “herd immunity” and containment (“flattening the curve”) are highly misleading in the context of this virus. Public policies based on these concepts are inadequate to protect the population. Only reducing the R0 of the virus below 1 is an effective strategy for maintaining the death burden of COVID-19 within the normal range of seasonal flu. The model is illustrated with the cases of Italy, France, and Iran and is able to describe the number of deaths as a function of time in all these cases although future projections tend to slightly overestimate the number of deaths when the analysis is made early on. The model can also be used to describe reopenings of the economy after a lockdown. The case mortality rate is still prone to large uncertainty, but modeling combined with an investigation of blood donations in The Netherlands imposes a lower limit of 1%. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Despite the severity of some cases, there are no current pathogen-specific antivirals available to treat the disease. Therefore, many studies have focused on the evaluation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of clinically available drugs. Here, we conducted a systematic review to describe the drug repositioning strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and to discuss the clinical impact of this approach in the current pandemic context. The systematic review was performed on March 23, 2020, using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS). The data were summarized in tables and critically analyzed. After the database search, 12 relevant studies were identified as eligible for the review. Among the drugs reported in these studies, 57 showed some evidence of antiviral activity. Antivirals, especially antiretrovirals, are the main class of therapeutic agents evaluated against COVID-19. Moreover, studies have reported the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of antitumor (16%; 9/57), antimalarial (7%, 4/57), and antibacterial (5%; 3/57) agents. Additionally, seven pharmacological agents (chloroquine, tetrandrine, umifenovir (arbidol), carrimycin, damageprevir, lopinavir/ritonavir) are in phase IV of clinical trials. Due to the evidence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of various clinically available agents, drug repositioning stands out as a promising strategy for a short-term response in the fight against the novel coronavirus. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.  antiinfective agent; antimalarial agent; antineoplastic agent; antiretrovirus agent; antivirus agent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antimalarials; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Government Financial Management and the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Comparative Look at South Korea and the United States The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory illness afflicting people to a degree not seen since the flu pandemic of 1968 when approximately one million lives were lost worldwide. What makes COVID-19 distinct is the rate at which it spread throughout the world, stress-testing health care systems and stymieing global economies. To confront this unprecedented crisis, nearly every country has been developing a wide range of policy responses, including fiscal measures. This study aims to discuss government fiscal responses to the pandemic from a financial management perspective. The core question is, “How does each country’s financial management system support its fiscal responses to the crisis?” We are particularly interested in reexamining commonly accepted norms about fiscal federalism and the fiscal condition of national and local governments heading into this pandemic. This study takes a comparative approach to the question, focusing on South Korea and the United States. Our findings suggest that the ability to respond to this pandemic in a comprehensive and effective manner is challenged by each nation’s financial management system that generates variation in policy coordination and responsiveness. © The Author(s) 2020.

At present, the development of supply chain finance is facing an important point: The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has a wide impact on the global economy, which not only generates the strong demand for supply chain finance, but also brings new uncertainty. At the same time, the accelerated development of Fintech provides more possibilities and tools for supply chain finance model innovation and risk management. This paper summarizes the current situation of supply chain finance from two aspects of practical development and theoretical research, and analyzes its future development trend. First of all, the practical development of supply chain finance is sorted out and divided into four stages for analysis. Secondly, with the help of bibliometrics tools, this paper analyzes and compares English and Chinese literature, and summarizes the theoretical research status from three aspects: Theoretical basis, optimization decision-making and risk management. Finally, there are three development trends of supply chain finance in the future, that is, the formation of healthy network ecosystem is an important basis for the development of supply chain finance, the adoption of modern Fintech enabling is a powerful tool for the development of supply chain finance, and bearing the social responsibility of sustainable development is the long-term goal of supply chain finance development. Meanwhile, it gives five key research issues that deserve attention. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China. All right reserved.

Indeed, transport accessibility of households, businesses, and retail activities is one of the main drivers that influence location choices and sustainable development and where the public transport services may play a key (positive) role. Furthermore, the economic crisis of the 2009 and the current ones caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has further limited the funds available for public services, including the transport sector. In this critical context, sound design of public transport services assumes great importance, especially in light of financial constraints. Starting from these considerations, the aim of this paper has been to propose an innovative methodology for designing public transport services based on a rational decision-making process with stakeholder engagement, aiming to perform a sustainable development perspective. The proposed methodology combines technical aspects, social and political issues, equity perspectives, and it is aimed in obtaining a design solution that can be accepted by the whole community. The proposed theoretical design methodology has also been applied to a case study in order to verify its applicability to a real context, consisting of the design of the public transport plan of the province of Foggia in southern Italy. Applications results show that the sustainable design scenario is not only the best ones from a technical point of view, but also participated, equitable, and approved by both policymakers and stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.

More than 213 Countries and Territories around the world have affected by the coronavirus COVID-19 and many more nations have been going through most critical situations in health and financial contexts as well. So many major attempts are made practicing to overcome negative impacts of this viral infection but there is no permanent solution has not been found yet. No availability of either vaccine or therapeutic antiviral drugs till now in any country to prevent and cure this infection. As the COVID19 infections were asymptomatic, the proper serodiagnostic tools also very essential besides the real time PCR as it takes much time for the results. Some of the practices have been running continuously like detection methods and alternative treatments for this major virus respiratory infection. But the major issue to be resolved patients are found be in again re-infection by COVID19. © International Knowledge Press. All rights reserved.

The badly balanced world market and the high degree of financialization of both primary agricultural production and food chains are decisive factors in this. The crisis highlights that the real economy is far too dependent on the financial economy. Financial capital operates as a paralyzing force. In this situation food sovereignty, peasant agriculture, territorial markets and agroecology emerge as indispensable ingredients for a recovery. © 2020 The Author(s).

We combine data on demography, contact patterns, disease severity, and health care capacity and quality to understand its impact and inform strategies for its control. Younger populations in lower-income countries may reduce overall risk, but limited health system capacity coupled with closer intergenerational contact largely negates this benefit. Mitigation strategies that slow but do not interrupt transmission will still lead to COVID-19 epidemics rapidly overwhelming health systems, with substantial excess deaths in lower-income countries resulting from the poorer health care available. Of countries that have undertaken suppression to date, lower-income countries have acted earlier. However, this will need to be maintained or triggered more frequently in these settings to keep below available health capacity, with associated detrimental consequences for the wider health, well-being, and economies of these countries. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

As the SARS-CoV-2 virus wreaks havoc on the populations, health care infrastructures and economies of nations around the world, finding ways to protect health care workers and bolster immune responses in the general population while we await an effective vaccine will be the difference between life and death for many people. Recent studies show that innate immune populations may possess a form of memory, termed Trained Immunity (TRIM), where innate immune cells undergo metabolic, mitochondrial, and epigenetic reprogramming following exposure to an initial stimulus that results in a memory phenotype of enhanced immune responses when exposed to a secondary, heterologous, stimulus. Throughout the literature, it has been shown that the induction of TRIM using such inducers as the BCG vaccine and β-glucan can provide protection through altered immune responses against a range of viral infections. Here we hypothesize a potential role for β-glucan in decreasing worldwide morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, and posit several ideas as to how TRIM may actually shape the observed epidemiological phenomena related to COVID-19. We also evaluate the potential effects of β-glucan in relation to the immune dysregulation and cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Ultimately, we hypothesize that the use of oral β-glucan in a prophylactic setting could be an effective way to boost immune responses and abrogate symptoms in COVID-19, though clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this treatment and to further examine differential effects of β-glucan's from various sources. © Copyright © 2020 Geller and Yan.

Resource-poor countries with weaker health systems are struggling with epidemics of their own and are now in a more uncertain situation with this rapidly spreading infection. Frontline healthcare workers are succumbing to the infection in their efforts to save lives. There is an urgency to develop treatments for COVID-19, yet there is limited clinical data on the efficacy of potential drug treatments. Countries worldwide implemented a stay-at-home order to “flatten the curve” and relieve the pressure on the health system, but it is uncertain how this will unfold after the economy reopens. Trehalose, a natural glucose disaccharide, is known to impair viral function through the autophagy system. Here, we propose trehalose as a potential preventative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. © Copyright © 2020 Martinon, Borges, Gomez and Shimada. autophagy; COVID-19; prophylaxis; SARS-CoV-2; trehalose interleukin 1beta; peptides and proteins; transcription factor eb; trehalose; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; trehalose; adult respiratory distress syndrome; autophagy (cellular); clinical trial (topic); contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; cross presentation; cytokine release; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; herd immunity; human; infection control; nonhuman; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virus replication; virus transmission; adult; aged; asymptomatic disease; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; middle aged; pandemic; physiology; post exposure prophylaxis; pre-exposure prophylaxis; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Asymptomatic Diseases; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Post-Exposure Prophylaxis; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Trehalose; Virus Replication COVID-19: Emergence of Infectious Diseases, Nanotechnology Aspects, Challenges, and Future Perspectives Wuhan, a city of China, is the epicenter for the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses. The antiviral drugs and their clinical advances, along with herbal medicines for viral inhibition and immunity boosters, are described.

An outbreak of a novel coronavirus 2019 infection has posed significant threat to the health and economies in the whole world. This article reviewed the viral replication, pathogenicity, prevention and treatment strategies. With a lack of approved treatment options for this virus, alternative approaches to control the spread of disease is in urgent need.

When the solid waste management challenge is exacerbated by a public health emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic, its real significance as an essential service becomes more apparent. The outbreak and spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has led to dramatic transformations of every sector of the Nigerian society including SWM systems, where formal and informal actors co-exist often in an uneasy relationship. Unfortunately, strategies for inclusive management of solid wastes during and after the Covid-19 pandemic are lacking in Nigeria, fuelling the further exclusion of informal sector in the waste governance and policy process in Nigeria. This paper reviews the state of the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria, identifies policy gaps in solid waste governance and highlights the linkages between Covid-19 and SWM with a view to catalysing inclusive solid waste governance and sustainability policy in Nigeria. It is argued that acknowledging the informal economy is the critical first step towards framing a sustainable SWM policy in which primary stakeholders are involved. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Federalism, policy instruments, and counter-cyclical responses to COVID-19 in the United States Federalism plays a foundational role in structuring public expectations about how the United States will respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, as both an unprecedented public-health crisis and an economic recession. As in prior crises, state governments are expected to be primary sites of governing authority, especially when it comes to immediate public-health needs, while it is assumed that the federal government will supply critical counter-cyclical measures to stabilize the economy and make up for major revenue shortfalls in the states. Yet there are reasons to believe that these expectations will not be fulfilled, especially when it comes to the critical juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the federal government has the capacity to engage in counter-cyclical spending to stabilize the economy, existing policy instruments vary in the extent to which they leverage that capacity. This leverage, we argue, depends on how decentralized policy arrangements affect the implementation of both discretionary emergency policies as well as automatic stabilization programs such as Unemployment Insurance, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Evidence on the US response to COVID-19 to date suggests the need for major revisions in the architecture of intergovernmental fiscal policy. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

It can spread among animals and has been reported to be transmitted from animal to human. COVID-19 cases have been increasing day by day and its economic impact on poor people has brought them down. The main aim of the study is to study the knowledge and awareness of the general public about the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. An online survey was conducted with a self-structured questionnaire comprising 15 questions that were distributed through the google forms among 100 subjects. The data were collected and the results were statistically analyzed. 65% of the participants were aware of COVID-19 and the economic impact caused due to this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading all over the world and the number of cases is increasing rapidly. Analyzing all the challenges, it was understood that participants were aware of the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research. All rights reserved.

The coherence wavelet method and the wavelet-based Granger causality tests applied to US recent daily data unveil the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 and oil price shocks on the geopolitical risk levels, economic policy uncertainty and stock market volatility over the low frequency bands. The effect of the COVID-19 on the geopolitical risk substantially higher than on the US economic uncertainty. The COVID-19 risk is perceived differently over the short and the long-run and may be firstly viewed as an economic crisis.

There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A systematic literature review of Coronavirus related diseases in Pakistan Pakistan is also seeing the profound effect of the outbreak of COVID-19, which demands an urgent investigation of literature and further scientific investigation for cure and prevention. This study has employed the systematic approach for searching the literature from the recently compiled database of researches namely COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) and related diseases. The literature on Pakistan has shown the evidence of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission of viruses, the presence of antibodies of MERS-CoV in camels, and careless attitude towards preventive measures of such respiratory diseases. There is a lot of gap in the literature regarding coronaviruses and their antibodies creating herd immunity for another coronavirus and COVID-19. In particular to Pakistan, and in general, for other developing countries, a weak health-care system coupled with the trembling economy has many implications of COVID-19 which should be carefully thought-out to combat the spread. © 2020 Haq et al.

This theoretical commentary focuses on the present and long-term impact of COVID-19 on transportation in Lagos State, Nigeria. The paper recognises the effect on transportation in emerging economies, where lockdowns and restrictions on movement may be ineffective, a state with high population density, poor transportation infrastructure and a large informal economy. Adopting the ‘avoid-shift-improve’ framework, this paper presents practical implications for public and private sector policymakers, as they navigate this precarious time and chart a new path for individuals and Nigeria. © 2020 COVID-19; Lagos; Nigeria; Social distancing; Transportation  Awareness and knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 lock down among Indian daily wage workers-a survey COVID 19 being the biggest pandemic affecting everyone around the globe either directly or indirectly. The rate of infection fastens everyday, where India stands 6th among all the countries in the world. Daily wage workers are the most affected personalities due to to covid-19 lockdown. Although many organisations help them and take them into attention, still a lot of them continue to struggle. The aim of the study is to create and test the extent of awareness on various effects of COVID-19 on daily wage workers. A self-assessed questionnaire comprising about 12 questions were passed on to 109 individuals through an online platform “google forms”. The responses were collected and analysed using SPSS software. Most of the respondents are aware about the various issues faced by the workers in their day to day life. They can also coexist in this society with us, after the massacre that is caused to them due to the lockdown, if we show some gratitude towards them. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

There is a significant possibility that economic stagnation would push a large population back into poverty. In the present study, we have reviewed the chronology and epidemiology of COVID-19 in Bangladesh and investigated the country's vulnerabilities concerning COVID-19 impacts. We focused primarily on four areas of vulnerabilities in Bangladesh: The garment industry, urban slums, social exclusion, and pre-existing health conditions. The result implicated that the country would take time to recover its economy due to the vulnerabilities mentioned above, and many people in Bangladesh would not be able to tolerate the current situation because they do not have enough reserves to do so. We concluded that if at least some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) had been at least partly attained, the situation would not be as dire as it is now. Based on this conclusion, we suggested a tolerance capacity to indicate how long people can survive without outside support. It is a holistic assessment rather than the indicators presently defined in each SDG, but it should be attained through a harmonized approach to SDGs. © 2020 by the authors.

From this figure, and following a stepwise meta-analysis of available reports, the case fatality rate (CFR) and the infectious case fatality rate (IFR) for the outbreak have been estimated. As the impact of age on these rates is notable, it is proposed to include an age-related adjusted fatality ratio in future comparative analyses between studies, calculated by adjusting the results by risk ratio to a reference age band (e.g., 60-69). From the casualty figures, and the corresponding CFR and IFR ratios, the forecast of serologically positive cases in the general Spanish population has been estimated at approximately 1% (0.87-1.3%) of the samples. If the data are confirmed by the ongoing study of the Carlos III Institute, until a vaccine is found, the immunity acquired in the general population after the infectious outbreak is far from the 65-70% herd immunity required as a barrier for COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, most COVID-19 patients receive traditional supportive care including breathing assistance. To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Second, since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development that aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation. © 2020 The Authors.

Thus, it is important to understand how global factors linked with the functioning of the Anthropocene are responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. We tested hypotheses that the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths and growth rate of recorded infections: (1) are positively associated with population density as well as (2) proportion of the human population living in urban areas as a proxies of interpersonal contact rate, (3) age of the population in a given country as an indication of that population's susceptibility to COVID-19; (4) net migration rate and (5) number of tourists as proxies of infection pressure, and negatively associated with (5) gross domestic product which is a proxy of health care quality. Data at the country level were compiled from publicly available databases and analysed with gradient boosting regression trees after controlling for confounding factors (e.g. geographic location). We found a positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases in a given country and gross domestic product, number of tourists, and geographic longitude. The number of deaths was positively associated with gross domestic product, number of tourists in a country, and geographic longitude. The effects of gross domestic product and number of tourists were non-linear, with clear thresholds above which the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased rapidly. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was positively linked to the number of tourists and gross domestic product. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was negatively associated with the mean age of the population and geographic longitude. Growth was slower in less urbanised countries. This study demonstrates that the characteristics of the human population and high mobility, but not population density, may help explain the global spread of the virus. In addition, geography, possibly via climate, may play a role in the pandemic. The unexpected positive and strong association between gross domestic product and number of cases, deaths, and growth rate suggests that COVID-19 may be a new civilisation disease affecting rich economies. © 2020 Skórka et al.

Its rapid transmissibility has forced whole countries to adopt strict measures to contain its spread. As part of necessary pandemic planning, most Canadian cardiac surgical programs have prioritized and delayed elective procedures in an effort to reduce the burden on the health care system and to mobilize resources in the event of a pandemic surge. While the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, new cases have begun to decline in many jurisdictions. This “flattening of the curve” has inevitably prompted discussions around reopening of the economy, relaxing some public health restrictions, and resuming nonurgent health care delivery. This document provides a template for cardiac surgical programs to begin to ramp-up the delivery of cardiac surgery in a deliberate and graded fashion as the COVID-19 pandemic burden begins to ease that is guided by 3 principles. First, all recommendations from public health authorities regarding COVID-19 containment must continue to be followed to minimize disease spread, ensure patient safety, and protect health care personnel. Second, patients awaiting elective cardiac surgery need to be proactively managed, reprioritizing those with high-risk anatomy or whose clinical status is deteriorating. Finally, case volumes should be steadily increased in a mutually agreed upon fashion and must balance the clinical needs of patients awaiting surgery against the overall requirements of the health care system. © 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society  Article; cardiac surgeon; coronavirus disease 2019; health care delivery; health care personnel; heart surgery; human; medical society; pandemic; patient safety; public health; Canada; Coronavirus infection; cost of illness; female; health care delivery; heart surgery; male; organization and management; pandemic; practice guideline; risk assessment; safety; surgeon; virus pneumonia; Canada; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Coronavirus Infections; Cost of Illness; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Assessment; Safety Management; Societies, Medical; Surgeons Dynamic interplay between social distancing duration and intensity in reducing COVID-19 US hospitalizations: A ""law of diminishing returns"" We uncover and highlight the importance of social distancing duration and intensity in lowering hospitalization demand-to-supply during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the USA. We have developed an epidemic progression model involving the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamics, the age-stratified disease transmissibility, and the possible large-scale undocumented (i.e., asymptomatic and/or untested) transmission of COVID-19 taking place in the USA. Our analysis utilizes COVID-19 observational data in the USA between March 19 and 28, corresponding to the early stage of the epidemic when the impacts of social distancing on disease progression were yet to manifest. Calibrating our model using epidemiological data from this time period enabled us to unbiasedly address the question ""How long and with what intensity does the USA need to implement social distancing intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic?""For a short (i.e., up to two weeks) duration, we find a near-linear decrease in hospital beds demand with increasing intensity (φ) of social distancing. For a duration longer than two weeks, our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. Long-term implementation of strict social distancing with φ > 50 % could lead to the emergence of a second wave of infections due to a large residual susceptible population which highlights the need for contact tracing and isolation before re-opening of the economy. Finally, we investigate the scenario of intermittent social distancing and find an optimal social-to-no-distancing duration ratio of 5:1 corresponding to a sustainable reduction in medical demands. © 2020 Author(s).  algorithm; Betacoronavirus; calibration; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; epidemic; hospitalization; human; medical informatics; pandemic; quarantine; social isolation; theoretical model; United States; virus pneumonia; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Calibration; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Epidemics; Hospitalization; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health Informatics; Quarantine; Social Isolation; United States COVID-19 and Economic Growth: Does Good Government Performance Pay Off? The coronavirus pandemic led to substantial revisions of 2020 GDP growth projections. We analyse whether and to what extent the quality of government policies in handling the health aspects of the crisis influence cross-country differences in the economic impact of the pandemic as projected by the OECD, the IMF and the World Bank. We measure policy quality by a recently published Economist Intelligence Unit index and a COVID-19 Misery index combining the stringency of government-imposed distancing measures with the COVID-19 fatality rate. Moreover, we control for international spillovers captured by trade openness and export exposure to tourism. Results for most specifications show that good government performance pays off as the respective countries record less severe revisions of growth forecasts. Only in a few cases, our findings suggest that the pandemic’s global effect might be so strong that actions by individual governments do not affect cross-country differences of growth revisions. Finally, there is broad evidence supporting the view that a country’s exposure to the global economy influences its growth outlook relative to other countries. © 2020, The Author(s).   Three months of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis The pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2019), reminiscent of the 2002-SARS-CoV outbreak, has completely isolated countries, disrupted health systems and partially paralyzed international trade and travel. In order to be better equipped to anticipate transmission of this virus to new regions, it is imperative to track the progress of the virus over time. This review analyses information on progression of the pandemic in the past 3 months and systematically discusses the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2019 virus including its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, the review also encompasses some recently proposed conceptual models that estimate the spread of this disease based on the basic reproductive number for better prevention and control procedures. Finally, we shed light on how the virus has endangered the global economy, impacting it both from the supply and demand side. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd ACE-2; COVID-19; mathematical modeling; pandemic; SARS-CoV alpha interferon; arbidol; chloroquine; favipiravir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; antivirus agent; antibody detection; antigen detection; basic reproduction number; clinical feature; computer model; conceptual model; coronavirus disease 2019; genome analysis; human; meta analysis; pandemic; pathophysiology; physical disease by body function; prevention and control; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus classification; virus morphology; virus transmission; adaptive immunity; Betacoronavirus; classification; commercial phenomena; Coronavirus infection; economics; genetics; laboratory technique; pandemic; pathogenicity; physiology; theoretical model; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; virus replication; Adaptive Immunity; Antiviral Agents; Basic Reproduction Number; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Commerce; Coronavirus Infections; Economics; Genome, Viral; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Replication COVID-19 Outbreak: An Overview Background: In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Summary: A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures. © 2020 S.

In spite of all assets utilized to neutralize the spreading of the infection, worldwide systems are expected to deal with the related emotional wellbeing issues. This flare-up is prompting extra medical issues, for example, stress, nervousness and sleeping disorders. Aggregate concerns impact day to day practices, economy, health associations and clinical centers, which can debilitate methodologies of COVID-19 control and lead to greater needs at a worldwide level. There have been unprecedented measures adopted to control the rapid spread during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey deals with the adherence to control measures exhibited by the public, effects on their life and their knowledge and awareness levels were evaluated and analysed. A self developed questionnaire of about 15 questions was prepared and circulated in google forms.The questions were based on the participants awareness level and practice of the preventive measures. This survey was conducted among the South Indian population using an online platform. 100 people have responded to the survey. The data was evaluated using SPSS software and Chisquare test was used for assessing statistical significance,p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Above average level of awareness of the preventive measures and possible development of mental and emotional issues were exhibited by the participants. Though the level of awareness wass high, other issues like the emotional challenges were present in more than 50% of the participants. The study shows that the general public has a high awareness level on preventive measures and treatment of emotional issues are the need of the hour. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

At this critical moment, it makes sense to interpret the systemic risk from the perspective of the financial crisis framework. By combing the latest research on systemic risks, we may arrive at some precautions relating to the current events. This literature review verifies the origin of systemic risk research. By comparing the retrieved and screened systemic literature with the relevant research on the financial crisis, more focus on the micro-foundations of systemic risk has been discovered. Besides, the measurement methods of systemic risks and the introduction of interdisciplinary methods have made the research in this field particularly active. This paper synthesizes the previous research conclusions to find the appropriate definition of systemic risk and combs the research literature of systemic risk from two lines: Firstly, conducting the division according to the sub-branch fields within the financial discipline and the relevant interdisciplinary research methods, which is helpful for scholars within and outside the discipline to have a more systematic understanding of the research in this field. Secondly predicting the research direction that can be expanded in this field. © 2020 by the authors.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused more than 3.7 million infected people and 260000 deaths over 210 countries around the world from December 2019 to May 7, 2020, which has seriously affected the safety of people, the stability of social order, and the development of the economy. Therefore, it is urgent to explore and implement new prevention and control programs for such major pandemics. With the development of robots and artificial intelligence technologies, various intelligent robots for emergency prevention and control in complex conditions have emerged, and they have played paramount roles in disease prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing. Based on the problems of insufficient supply of materials and heavy disinfection tasks during the prevention and control of major outbreaks, we study the systematic procedures and applications of medical material handling robots, multi-scene disinfection robots, medical assistant robots, prevention and control robots, and production resumption robots. Moreover, we comparatively analyze the current situation of key technologies of pandemic emergency prevention and control robots, such as environmental perception, autonomous navigation, motion planning, and 5G communication technology. In conclusion, we put forward a technical prospect of intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics. © 2020, Science Press.

We are all aware of the profound social and economic consequences of the pandemic (WHO, 2020)"". Such consequences are the result of counter-measures such as lockdowns, and world-wide reductions in production and consumption, amplified by cascading impacts through international supply chains. Using a global multi-regional macro-economic model, we capture direct and indirect spill-over effects in terms of social and economic losses, as well as environmental effects of the pandemic. Based on information as of May 2020, we show that global consumption losses amount to 3.8$tr, triggering significant job (147 million full-time equivalent) and income (2.1$tr) losses. Global atmospheric emissions are reduced by 2.5Gt of greenhouse gases, 0.6Mt of PM2.5, and 5.1Mt of SO2 and NOx. While Asia, Europe and the USA have been the most directly impacted regions, and transport and tourism the immediately hit sectors, the indirect effects transmitted along international supply chains are being felt across the entire world economy. These ripple effects highlight the intrinsic link between socio-economic and environmental dimensions, and emphasise the challenge of addressing unsustainable global patterns. How humanity reacts to this crisis will define the post-pandemic world. © 2020 Public Library of Science.

Globalisation is under significant threat as governments scramble to reduce their vulnerability to the virus by limiting global trade and flows of people. With the imposition of border closures and strict migration measures, there have been major disruptions in Africa's global supply chains with adverse impacts on employment and poverty. The African economies overly reliant on single export-orientated industries, such as oil and gas, are expected to be severely hit. This situation is further aggravated by tumbling oil prices and a lowered global demand for African non-oil products. The agricultural sector, which should buffer these shocks, is also being affected by the enforcement of lockdowns which threaten people's livelihoods and food security. Lockdowns may not be the answer in Africa and the issue of public health pandemic response will need to be addressed by enacting context-specific policies which should be implemented in a humane way. In addressing the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on African nations, we argue that governments should prioritize social protection programmes to provide people with resources to maintain economic productivity while limiting job losses. International funders are committing assistance to Africa for this purpose, but generally as loans (adding to debt burdens) rather than as grants. G20 agreement so suspend debt payments for a year will help, but is insufficient to fiscal need. Maintaining cross-border trade and cooperation to continue generating public revenues is desirable. New strategies for diversifying African economies and limiting their dependence on external funding by promoting trade with a more regionalised (continental) focus as promoted by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, while not without limitations, should be explored. While it is premature to judge the final economic and death toll of COVID-19, African leaders' response to the pandemic, and the support they receive from wealthier nations, will determine its eventual outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).

Previous respiratory virus outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic H1N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), have provided significant insights into preparation and provision of intensive care support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Many patients have already been supported with ECMO during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and it is likely that many more may receive ECMO support, although, at this point, the role of ECMO in COVID-19-related cardiopulmonary failure is unclear. Here, we review the experience with the use of ECMO in the past respiratory virus outbreaks and discuss potential role for ECMO in COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).

A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including patient quarantine and mass “social distancing” measures. Although the clinical manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide. Given the clinical insights into CoVID-19 and the challenges presented in this review for the U.S. rural population, mitigation strategies should be designed accordingly to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this contagion. © 2020 by the authors.

It has also sparked fears of an impending economic crisis and recession. Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions have lead to a reduced workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast, the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector is also facing increased demand due to panic-buying and stockpiling of food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy. © 2020 IJS Publishing Group Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Economic impact; Economy; SARS-CoV-2 agriculture; aviation; China; coronavirus disease 2019; domestic violence; drug industry; economic aspect; education; Europe; finance; food industry; game addiction; health care industry; hospital; housing; human; Japan; manufacturing industry; oil industry; pandemic; petrochemical industry; priority journal; real estate; research; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social media; socioeconomics; sport; tourism; United Kingdom; United States; Betacoronavirus; catering service; commercial phenomena; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; economics; employment; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Commerce; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Employment; Food Supply; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Socioeconomic Factors The impact of COVID-19 on HIV treatment and research: A call to action The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far reaching, with devastating effects on individuals, communities, and societies across the world. People with chronic health conditions may be at greater risk of contracting or experiencing complications from COVID-19. In addition to illness or death for those who contract the virus, the physical distancing required to flatten the curve of new cases is having a negative impact on the economy, the effects of which intersect with mental health and other existing health concerns, thus affecting marginalized communities. Given that HIV also has a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, COVID-19 is affecting people with HIV (PWH) in unique ways and will continue to have an impact on HIV research and treatment after the COVID-19 crisis passes. Using the biopsychosocial framework to contextualize the impact of COVID-19 on PWH, the purpose of this review article is to: (1) outline the similarities and differences between the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics; (2) describe the current and future impact of COVID-19 on PWH; and (3) outline a call to action for scientists and practitioners to respond to the impact of COVID-19 on HIV prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite all resources employed to counteract the spreading of the virus, additional global strategies are needed to handle the related mental health issues. Methods: Published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak and other previous global infections have been considered and reviewed. Comments: This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally. Collective concerns influence daily behaviors, economy, prevention strategies and decision-making from policy makers, health organizations and medical centers, which can weaken strategies of COVID-19 control and lead to more morbidity and mental health needs at global level. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus; COVID-19; mental health; Outbreak Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; global health; human; mental health; pandemic; pathogenicity; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral COVID-19 and older people in Asia: Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia calls to actions The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has casted a huge impact on global public health and the economy. In this challenging situation, older people are vulnerable to the infection and the secondary effects of the pandemic and need special attention. To evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on older people, it is important to balance the successful pandemic control and active management of secondary consequences. These considerations are particularly salient in the Asian context, with its diversity among countries in terms of sociocultural heritage, healthcare setup and availability of resources. Thus, the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia summarized the considerations of Asian countries focusing on responses and difficulties in each country, impacts of health inequity related to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed recommendations for older people, which are germane to the Asian context. More innovative services should be developed to address the increasing demands for new approaches to deliver healthcare in these difficult times and to establish resilient healthcare systems for older people.

To mitigate its impact on societies, health systems and economies, countries have adopted non-pharmacological preventive practices such as ‘spatial’ or ‘social’ distancing, the use of protective masks, and handwashing; these have been widely implemented. However, measures aimed at protecting physical health and healthcare systems have side-effects that might have a big impact on individuals’ wellbeing. As the pandemic reaches low- and middle-income countries, weaker health systems, limited resources and the lower socioeconomic status of their populations make halting the pandemic more challenging. In this article, we explore the impact of COVID-19 and its prevention measures on the wellbeing of vulnerable populations. Special attention must be given to homeless, indigenous, migrant and imprisoned populations, as well as people living with disabilities and the elderly. More than just resolute governmental action will be required to overcome the pandemic. Links between science and political actions have to be strengthened. Fighting COVID-19 is a collective endeavour and community action, on a global scale, is of paramount importance. © 2020 The Author(s) COVID-19; LMIC; Social distancing; Vulnerable populations; Wellbeing aged; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disabled person; government; health care access; health care system; health service; homeless person; human; indigenous people; infection prevention; middle income country; migrant; misinformation; pandemic; prisoner; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social interaction; social status; vulnerable population; wellbeing; Coronavirus infection; developing country; health care planning; mental health; pandemic; psychology; social isolation; virus pneumonia; vulnerable population; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Developing Countries; Health Priorities; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Isolation; Vulnerable Populations Valuation of air pollution externalities: comparative assessment of economic damage and emission reduction under COVID-19 lockdown Air pollution (AP) is one of the major causes of health risks as it leads to widespread morbidity and mortality each year. Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities—Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2, and SO2 are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities. This helps in understanding the magnitude of actual damage and brings out a more holistic picture of the damages related to lockdown. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

This approach ignores how systems interact and how their systemic properties shape socioeconomic outcomes, leading to an over-emphasis on a limited set of characteristics, notably efficiency. We argue that this emphasis on efficiency in the operation, management and outcomes of various economic and social systems is not a conscious collective choice, but rather the response of the whole system to the incentives that individual components face. This has brought much of the world to rely upon complex, nested, and interconnected systems to deliver goods and services around the globe. While this approach has many benefits, the Covid-19 crisis shows how it has also reduced the resilience of key systems to shocks, and allowed failures to cascade from one system to others. This paper reviews the impact of COVID-19 on socioeconomic systems, discusses the notion of resilience, and provides specific recommendations on both integrating resilience analytics for recovery from the current crisis as well as on building resilient infrastructure to address future systemic challenges. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

The effects of the pandemic on the world economic and political future [Covid-19: Crisi della globalizzazione e “Rivincita dei confini”. Le ricadute della pandemia sul futuro economico-politico mondiale] The rapid global spread of the Covid-19 virus has strongly highlighted, on multiple and transcalar levels, some problems that emerged worldwide after the end of bipolarism and the advent of the 21st century, i.e. the crisis of globalization and the “revenge of the borders”, which have clear repercussions on the world economic and political situation. The pandemic is entering a phase of global instability, linked to the tensions caused by the trade war between the United States and China, as well as the slowdown of the economy and the growth of populisms. In this sense, the consequences of the pandemic have caused the greatest shock to the international order since the Second World War. © 2020 Universita degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata.

Covid-19; Deglobalization; Slowbalization  Targeting the World’s Slums as Fat Tails in the Distribution of COVID-19 Cases A recent article by Corburn et al. lays out the policies that would help slum communities in the global south deal with COVID-19. That article notes the vulnerabilities of people in these informal settlements and argues that any assistance program must recognize these realities so that the policies do not further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the population of these communities. This note extends the arguments in that paper, focusing on some of the logistic issues involved in providing assistance to informal settlements. It argues that such assistance is essential not only for the help it would provide to people in these settlements but also because the residents of these communities should be key targets of assistance. Because of the location and occupation of most of the residents of these communities, targeting them simultaneously addresses health and economy-wide concerns generated by COVID-19. Their characteristics make them much more likely to be afflicted by the virus and spread it to others. The main conclusions of this note with respect to policy are that the scale of such assistance is likely to be larger than has so far been proposed, that in countries with limited testing ability slums provide one of the most effective places to target assistance, that the role of community groups in providing the assistance is difficult to exaggerate, and that philanthropy has a role to play in supporting innovation. © 2020, The New York Academy of Medicine.

No proven effective antiviral therapy or vaccine currently exists, and supportive care remains to be the cornerstone treatment. Through previous lessons learned from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV studies, scientific groups worldwide have rapidly expanded the knowledge pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 virology that includes in vitro and in vivo models for testing of antiviral therapies and randomized clinical trials. In the present narrative, we review SARS-CoV-2 virology, clinical features, pathophysiology, and animal models with a specific focus on the antiviral and adjunctive therapies currently being tested or that require testing in animal models and randomized clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors.

However, due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal is not only going to lose a significant portion of remittances but will also face the Herculean task of creating employment for the workforce who may return to Nepal. This paper discusses sustainable options for the Nepali government to help create employment for its citizens in Nepal through the revitalization of fallow lands and other potential agricultural areas, which are below a 15° slope. The land-use and land-cover data for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are derived from the classification of satellite images. These classified and resampled 30 m × 30 m images along with the 30 × 30 m elevation data are brought to the Kibana Platform within the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to analyze the status of land-use and-cover conditions for the 1980 to 2010 period within nine different slope classes at an interval of 5° slope. Our findings suggest there have been massive conversions of forested areas for agricultural land at lower slope areas between 1980 and 2000, but the trend began to reverse from 2000 to 2010 as trees started coming back to the fallow agricultural lands. This happened mainly because, during the countrywide Maoist insurgency period (1996–2006), many youth first took shelter in various urban centers away from their natal homes and then emigrated to foreign countries for remittance purposes. As a result, many farmlands became fallow and barren, and agricultural productivity decreased. Consequently, Nepal, an exporter of rice and pulses until the late 1980s, started importing food grain each year. The major goals of this research are to explore: (a) if Nepal can self-sustain in agricultural products by utilizing potential agricultural lands below a 15° slope in various geographic regions; (b) the means for productively engaging the youth returning to the country; and (c) methods of reinvigorating the ecosystem services of Nepal to support sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

Reflection: Critical issues emerged during Covid-19 [Per una ridefinizione del modello turistico nazionale. Spunti di riflessioni a partire dalle criticità emerse durante il Covid-19] The new emergency we are facing with current spread of coronavirus imposes restrictions in everyday life and mobility across different territories and countries; we are globally compelled to face mutual problems, regardless of unilateral positions and this is giving strength to globalization just when a crisis of the globalized world model seemed to be consolidating. Even modern tourism in the pre-pandemic economic and political situation was building a path of progressive quantitative growth and showing positive signs even in the most difficult moments of the recent international economic crisis. However, global tourism is now displaying an overall weakness as never happened in the pasts and it is starting featuring negative data and forecasts showing how this emergency is affecting a substantial portion of the Italian economy, which has reached 13,2% of GDP in 2018 with subsequent significant meaning also in terms of employment. Although it is difficult to foresee future tourism developments, this paper wants to suggest a reflection on the possible scenarios that could be configured out in the medium term, starting from considerations on the role that the national corporate system in tourism has played within the Italian supply chain. © 2020 Universita degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata.

Italian tourist system; Sustainable tourism; Tourist industry  Paradox of a supply constrained keynesian equilibrium the COVID-19 case The Indian economy, which was facing demand deficiency and slowdown prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, plunged further with the lockdown. The present exercise represents the current problem as a typical demand constrained Keynesian equilibrium, afflicted further by demand and supply failures generated by transaction costs. The resulting scenario resembles a “supply constrained” Keynesian equilibrium. The article looks at the possible impact on prices and discusses the implications of select policy interventions for such an economy. © 2020 Economic and Political Weekly. All rights reserved.   Lessons from COVID-19 can prepare global tourism for the economic transformation needed to combat climate change The COVID-19 pandemic led to the cessation of almost all international travel in the first half of 2020. A return to pre-pandemic growth patterns will take time and depend on the depth and extent of the recession sparked by COVID-19. The recovery phase will overlap with global efforts to deal with the evolving climate crisis. For the tourism industry to thrive in a future world it must look beyond the temptation of adopting strategies based on a return to the pre-COVID-19 normal of the past and instead seek to understand how it should respond to the emerging transformation of the global economy to carbon neutrality. Many of the lessons that emerged from the pandemic can be applied to strategies to deal with climate change. Of most interest is the success of strategies such as “flattening the curve”. Application of similar strategies plus adoption of the circular economy model to wind back Green House Gas emissions will help avert the global environmental disaster that will occur if global temperatures continue to increase. These strategies point to what a future carbon-neutral economic production system might look like, the path to which could offer the tourism industry numerous opportunities to transform from the current model that favours a high resource consumption model to one that is environmentally friendly and resource neutral. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The events of the current COVID-19 pandemic have further emphasised existing issues within our health systems. There is no better time than now to come together in global solidarity to tackle these evolving threats of COVID-19 pandemic. The Commonwealth is an ideally placed network to tackle these global health challenges, with its wide-reaching networks of governmental, non-governmental and civil society organisations across all continents. Although the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) originally scheduled to take place in Kigali in Rwanda 22-27 June 2020 has been postponed in view of COVID-19, Commonwealth country discussions are continuing, centred on the CHOGM key theme of 'Delivering a Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming', and five subthemes of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Innovation; Trade; Environment; Governance and the Rule of Law; and Youth. The planned CHOGM and Commonwealth itself provides all members a timely platform to consider innovative ways to connect, innovate and transform healthcare to meet the needs of their populations. This commentary considers these five CHOGM subthemes and how member nations can be supported to achieve universal health coverage through optimising medicines use and outcomes, in the midst of a global pandemic in line with the global health agenda. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this survey, we examine the impact of the outbreak on the Indonesian economy, as well as the government’s response to the public health crisis and its provisions for the emerging economic crisis. Indonesia’s delay in responding to the health crisis while Covid-19 spread in neighbouring countries in January–February 2020 has been costly for the health of the population. The government’s policy responses have so far been aimed at steadying the ship, addressing both the needs of the poor and the potentially poor (vulnerable) groups. At the time of writing, Covid-19 had not been tamed in Indonesia by any means. Hence, its implications for economic growth, jobs and welfare remained uncertain, as policy discussions were all about opening up the economy from virus-imposed restrictions across the country, under what has been termed the ‘new normal’. © 2020 ANU Indonesia Project.

The nonhomogeneous continent faces local contextual complexities that require locally relevant and culturally appropriate COVID-19 interventions. This paper examines demographic, economic, political, health, and socio-cultural differentials in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The health systems need to be strengthened through extending the health workforce by mobilizing and engaging the diaspora, and implementing the International Health Regulations (2005) core capacities. In the absence of adequate social protection and welfare programs targeting the poor during the pandemic, sub-Saharan African countries need to put in place flexible but effective policies and legislation approaches that harness and formalise the informal trade and remove supply chain barriers. This could include strengthening cross-border trade facilities such as adequate pro-poor, gender-sensitive, and streamlined cross-border customs, tax regimes, and information flow. The emphasis should be on cross-border infrastructure that not only facilitates trade through efficient border administration but can also effectively manage cross-border health threats. There is an urgent need to strengthen social protection systems to make them responsive to crises, and embed them within human rights-based approaches to better support vulnerable populations and enact health and social security benefits. The COVI-19 response needs to adhere to the well-established ‘do no harm’ principle to prevent further damage or suffering as a result of the pandemic and examined through local lenses to inform peace-building initiatives that may yield long-term gains in the post-COVID-19 recovery efforts. © 2020 by the author.

As it spreads across the world, it has overwhelmed health care systems, strangled the global economy, and led to a devastating loss of life. Widespread efforts from regulators, clinicians, and scientists are driving a rapid expansion of knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. The authors review the most current data, with a focus on the basic understanding of the mechanism(s) of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutics. The authors discuss the basic virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, multiorgan consequences, and outcomes. With a focus on cardiovascular complications, they propose several mechanisms of injury.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 2019-CoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; potential interventions; SARS alpha tocopherol; antivirus agent; ascorbic acid; chloroquine; cinanserin; cyclosporine; diarylheptanoid derivative; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; emodin; flavonoid; immunoglobulin; interferon; iron; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monoclonal antibody; nelfinavir; nicotianamine; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; promazine; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; retinol; ribavirin; selenium; thymopentin; thymosin alpha1; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin B group; zinc; COVID-19; immunologic factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trace element; virus vaccine; vitamin; antiviral therapy; China; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; diet therapy; human; infection control; nonhuman; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus infection; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; nutritional status; passive immunization; pathogenicity; plasma; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Immunologic Factors; Nutritional Status; Plasma; Pneumonia, Viral; Trace Elements; Viral Vaccines; Vitamins Novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A lesson from animal coronaviruses The recent pandemic caused by the novel human coronavirus, referrred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), not only is having a great impact on the health care systems and economies in all continents but it is also causing radical changes of common habits and life styles. The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown. However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features. A full comprehension of the mechanisms driving the evolution of animal CoVs will help better understand the emergence, spreading, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 The Authors Animal coronaviruses; COVID-19; Genetic plasticity; Host switch; Novel human coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Tissue tropism case report; clinical article; comprehension; coronavirus disease 2019; human; nonhuman; review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tropism; animal; Betacoronavirus; classification; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus infection; disease model; genetics; isolation and purification; molecular evolution; pandemic; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Zoonoses COVID-19 and Bangladesh: Challenges and How to Address Them As the coronavirus outbreak quickly surges worldwide, many countries are adopting non-therapeutic preventive measures, which include travel bans, remote office activities, country lockdown, and most importantly, social distancing. However, these measures face challenges in Bangladesh, a lower-middle-income economy with one of the world's densest populations. Social distancing is difficult in many areas of the country, and with the minimal resources the country has, it would be extremely challenging to implement the mitigation measures. Mobile sanitization facilities and temporary quarantine sites and healthcare facilities could help mitigate the impact of the pandemic at a local level. A prompt, supportive, and empathic collaboration between the Government, citizens, and health experts, along with international assistance, can enable the country to minimize the impact of the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Anwar, Nasrullah and Hosen. community mitigation; COVID-19; healthcare; infection prevention and control; non-therapeutic intervention; novel coronavirus; testing  Coronavirus outbreak causes halal sex tourism to suffer The COVID-19 flare-up in Indonesia has been reacted to with detachment by the focal government, which stressed that Indonesia has not experienced numerous instances of contamination, if by any stretch of the imagination. The Indonesia wellbeing priest had likewise created a ruckus with his open proclamation on the COVID-19 when he urged the individuals to depend on 'petition' as a preventive mark as he ticked off the individuals who purchased covers at a more significant expense. Actually, the COVID-19 episode has in truth devastatingly affected Indonesia's economy, particularly the movement and the travel industry segment. The marvel of agreement marriage is a typical wonder that happens in the Southeast Asian area. The act of agreement relationships is as of now predominant in a few Southeast Asian nations, for example, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. In Indonesia, the act of agreement relationships happens in a few locales, for example, West Java, Central Java and East Java and Kalimantan which are completed by remote men from the Middle East. This has become upsides and downsides among Indonesian individuals. Already, Saudi sex searchers hit Thailand during the 80s . In 1989, when relations between the two nations experienced issues brought about by a case called ""blue jewel business"", the Government of Saudi Arabia disallowed its residents from visiting Thailand. Subsequently, visitors from Saudi Arabia and followed by different sightseers from the Gulf nations made a beeline for Indonesia. © 2020 SERSC.

So far, 136 reports from the WHO were reported. In the latest report, 6416828 patients in almost all countries have been infected with the COVID-19. The present study discusses the different aspects of COVID such as emergence, signs and symptoms, comparisons with SARS and MERS, concerns, governments' actions in controlling the virus and a descriptive analysis of the spread and death. The emergence of the coronavirus family in the last two decades has created a public health issue around the world. It has also caused serious damages to infrastructure, economy, culture and communities of countries. Thus, affected governments have taken steps to reduce these concerns such as quarantine, education, traffic control, closure of recreational centers, reduction of working hours etc. Despite strict measures to contain the COVID-19, this virus is still expanding and the question of ""what actions should be taken with what political package?"" is being asked. To answer this question, it is important to understand the process of disease occurrence and modeling different interventions on changing the natural course of the disease is very important. © Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Anesthesiology Research Center. Coronavirus case fatality; COVID-19; MERS; Novel coronavirus; SARS; SARS-CoV-2  The first 75 days of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak: Recent advances, prevention, and treatment The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) outbreak has engulfed an unprepared world amidst a festive season. The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate.

This has led to a significant impact on the lives and economy in China and other countries. Here we develop a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model with binomial distributions to study the transmission of the disease. Model parameters are estimated on the basis of fitting to newly reported data from January 11 to February 13, 2020 in China. The estimates of the contact rate and the effective reproductive number support the efficiency of the control measures that have been implemented so far. Simulations show the newly confirmed cases will continue to decline and the total confirmed cases will reach the peak around the end of February of 2020 under the current control measures. The impact of the timing of returning to work is also evaluated on the disease transmission given different strength of protection and control measures. © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

The different pandemics that humanity has experienced, such as the Spanish Flu, Asian Flu, Hong Kong Flu, HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola, and Swine Flu, have had a great impact on the economy, the environment and any human activity, such as livestock, agriculture, tourism, transport, education, health, fishing, mining, industry, commerce, etc. Currently, humanity is facing another pandemic, the infection of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that generates the disease known as COVID-19. The objective of this document is to analyze and discuss the effects in agriculture of events related to the disease of COVID- 19. For this analysis, data from the Food Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and scientific and technical documents have been used. There is sufficient evidence to affirm that the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 disease has an important effect on agriculture and the food supply chain, mainly affecting food demand and consequently food security, with a great impact on the most vulnerable population. © 2020 All rights reserved. 2019-nCoV; Agriculture; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Food security; Food supply chain  Impact of COVID-19 large scale restriction on environment and economy in Indonesia COVID-19 has a severe and widespread impact, especially in Indonesia. COVID-19 was first reported in Indonesia on March 03, 2020 then rapidly spread to all 34 provinces by April 09, 2020. Since then, COVID-19 is declared a state of national disaster and health emergency. This research analyzes the difference of CO, HCHO, NO2, and SO2 density in Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi before and during the pandemic. Also, this study assesses the effect of large scale restrictions on the economic growth during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. In a nutshell, the results on Wilcoxon and Fisher test by significance level α=5% as well as odds ratio showed that there are significant differences of CO density in all regions with highest odds ratio in East Java (OR=9.07), significant differences of HCHO density in DKI Jakarta, East Java, and South Sulawesi. There are significant differences of NO2 density before and during public activities limitation in DKI Jakarta, West Java, East Java, and South Sulawesi. However, the results show that there are no significant differences of SO2 density in all regions. In addition, this research shows that there are significant differences of retail, grocery and pharmacy, and residental mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This research also shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic there are severe economic losses, industry, companies, and real disruptions are severe for all levels of life due to large scale restrictions. © 2020 GJESM.

It is a documentary-type investigative work, with a descriptive and purposeful approach, structured in three sections: 1) impact of Covid-19 on employment, informality and poverty; 2) contributions from the social economy before Covid 19; 3) relevance of the social economy in times of pandemic. The article concludes that the social economy is a model that provides social benefits, contributes significantly to the satisfaction of needs in times of crisis and can become a fundamental element for solving Colombia's structural problems, evidenced by the pandemic, which must be resolved through the construction of a new social pact. © 2020, Universidad del Zulia.

Dilemmas of sustainable development in the COVID-19 era – an example of Great Britain [Między ekonomią a bezpieczeństwem. Dylematy zrównoważonego rozwoju w erze koronawirusa – przykład wielkiej brytanii] The coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted social stability in many countries around the world. This has consequences for sustainable development. In a situation of stability, two competing pillars of sustainable devel-opment: the economic and the environmental one, are in the lead – as long as the basic needs of most people are satisfied. In the conditions of instability, the social pillar begins to dominate, pushing the economic and environmental pillars to the background. The fight against the pandemic is or has been carried out in different countries in different ways. We can talk about the Chinese, Taiwanese, or European models, among others. In the United Kingdom, the laissez-faire model was used for a short time. This was an interesting strategy (though a very risky one) that attempted to reconcile different pillars of sustainable development in the face of crisis, seeking a com-promise between health considerations, social situation, and the requirements of the economy. However, this ap-proach was quickly rejected under the influence of public opinion, the media and scientific authorities. In the situation of impending crisis, the social pillar began to dominate. The dilemma economy vs. security was resolved according to the hierarchy of needs (with security being a more basic need). This is a tip for the future – for social policy and planning in times of stability. In a situation of deep biological crisis (as opposed to economic crises), the social factor comes to the fore in the end, at the expense of all others. Within the social factor, the hierarchy of goals will be established according to the hierarchy of needs. © 2020, Politechnika Lubelska. All rights reserved.

Under the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic expansion, today it is supposed that a huge global crisis will follow in all fields (humanitarian, social, economic). The pandemic impact is difficult to be evaluated until it stops or at least its peak will be reached. As a contribution to such work, we propose an estimation-simulation model, as an alternative to other models coming from probabilistic, genetic algorithms or other approaches. In order to analyse the dynamics of the spread of epidemic among the population, we built a model with differential equations for a special logistic time-function, which resulted in certain key-values and four phases of its evolution. Moreover, by simulating the daily dynamics of pandemic at three levels (world, EU, and Romania) we estimated the impact of pandemic on the economic growth until the end of this year. © 2020, Institute for Economic Forecasting.

Like other countries, Burkina Faso is affected by the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). This study analyzes the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Burkina Faso's economy. For this purpose, we have made use of a single country's computable general equilibrium model and formulated two alternative scenarios based on the likely duration of the pandemic. In the first scenario, we assume that the pandemic will last three (3) months, while in the second scenario, it spreads over six (6) months. The results indicate significant impacts on both macroeconomic and sectoral level and on households' well-being. First, economic growth could drop from 5.7 percent in 2019 to a range between +1.38 percent and-1.75 percent in 2020. Moreover, the unemployment is expected to grow (between +1.93 percent and +5.92 percent) because of a sharp drop in sectoral productions (ranging from-3 percent to-12 percent). In addition, our findings reveal a contraction of sectoral exports by-6 percent for extraction products (especially gold) to-16 percent for agricultural products (especially the cotton). Finally, the rise of consumer prices and growing unemployment will greatly dampen the purchasing power of households for all socio-professional categories. © 2020.   A Comprehensive Review of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Role of IoT, Drones, AI, Blockchain, and 5G in Managing its Impact The unprecedented outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus, termed as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO), has placed numerous governments around the world in a precarious position. The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its impact on the global economy. In drawing things to a close, we explore the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G, among others, to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak. © 2013 IEEE. 5G; AI; Blockchain; Coronavirus; COVID-19; global economic impact; IoMT applications; IoT; pandemic; transmission stages; UAVs for disaster management 5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Blockchain; Drones; Coronaviruses; Global economies; Health implications; Health-care system; Internet of thing (IOT); World Health Organization; Internet of things Changes in the communication strategy of Barcelona's digital economy in response to the COVID-19 crisis This article presents the results of a study carried out using data provided by professionals responsible for planning and executing communication strategies for 30 leading companies involved in the digital economy of Barcelona, site of the Mobile World Congress technological trade show, which was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 health crisis. The results of the study, carried out electronically from 1-15 April 2020, show that 77% of the technology companies that participated in the study changed their strategic communication planning during the first month of the state of alarm declared by the Spanish government on 14 March 2020. In 73% of cases, the strategy was proactive, although with a new orientation. The resulting mix of actions included preparing and disseminating digital content, sending press releases, organising digital events, generating internal communication and, to a lesser extent, advertising, following a strategy that combined 60% of owned media, 27% of earned media, and 13% of paid media. During the first month of the state of alarm in response to COVID-19, social media was the main communication channel for the digital companies that participated in the study, compared to print media, television, and radio. 30% of these communication actions used newsjacking techniques, tying their messages to the current situation of the pandemic. © 2020 Blanquerna School of Communication and International Relations.

As our knowledge of the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the symptomatology and management of COVID-19 expands, orthopedic surgeons must remain up to date on the latest medical evidence and surgical perspectives. While COVID-19 primarily manifests with pulmonary symptoms, cardiovascular, neurologic, and other major organ systems may also be affected and present with hallmark imaging findings. This article reviews initial and emerging literature on clinical characteristics and imaging findings of COVID-19. © 2020, The Author(s). coronavirus; COVID-19; diagnostic imaging; orthopedics  Risk Assessment of COVID-19 Based on Multisource Data from a Geographical Viewpoint In June 4, 2020, Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) cases in Wuhan were cleared, and the epidemic situation was basically controlled. Such public safety infectious disease includes influences great pressure on the national economy. At present, some countries and regions in the world are still in epidemic situation, and there is an urgent need to judge the infection situation and travel risk in the region. In a relatively fine scale down to perceive the surrounding situation, and then rational zoning decisions to promote the resumption of production and work. In this study, indicators for the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic were constructed using multi-sourced data. A computational evaluation of 736 fine-grained grids was performed using the GeoDetector model and the decision tree model. The study found that the risk level in older neighborhoods was much higher than in newer neighborhoods; the population density was the most important determinant of infection; the number of urban people slumped to 37% of that in usual times according to Tencent data after the 'city closure'; The model this paper used portrays the major factor in defining low-risk areas and high-risk areas, and offers suggestions and assessment from a geographical perspective to fight COVID-19, thus presenting great practical value. © 2013 IEEE.

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: An open-label randomized clinical trial study was performed in Tabriz, NorthWest of Iran. They were randomized to either the treatment with the bromhexine group or the control group, in a 1:1 ratio with 39 patients in each arm. Standard therapy was used in both groups and those patients in the treatment group received oral bromhexine 8 mg three times a day additionally. The primary outcome was a decrease in the rate of ICU admissions, intubation/ mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Results: A total of 78 patients with similar demographic and disease characteristics were enrolled. There was a significant reduction in ICU admissions (2 out of 39 vs. 11 out of 39, P= 0.006), intubation (1 out of 39 vs. 9 out of 39, P= 0.007) and death (0 vs. 5, P= 0.027) in the bromhexine treated group compared to the standard group. No patients were withdrawn from the study because of adverse effects. Conclusion: The early administration of oral bromhexine reduces the ICU transfer, intubation, and the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. This affordable medication can easily be administered everywhere with a huge positive impact(s) on public health and the world economy. Altogether, the verification of our results on a larger scale and different medical centers is strongly recommended. © 2020 The Author(s).

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial task, as it reduces the risk of pandemic spread, and early treatment will save patients' life. Due to the time-consuming, complex nature, and high false-negative rate of the gold-standard RT-PCR test used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the need for an additional diagnosis method has increased. Studies have proved the significance of X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The dissemination of deep-learning techniques on X-ray images can automate the diagnosis process and serve as an assistive tool for radiologists. In this study, we used four deep-learning models-DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19-using the transfer-learning concept for the diagnosis of X-ray images as COVID-19 or normal. In the proposed study, VGG16 and VGG19 outperformed the other two deep-learning models. The study achieved an overall classification accuracy of 99.3%. © 2020 by the authors.

We considered two scenarios. The first scenario has two channels of transmission over the economic system: a negative shock of labour supply due to the rates of morbidity and mortality caused by the pandemic, and a temporary shutdown of nonessential economic activities. The second scenario adds to the first the effects of the government fiscal package adopted to counteract the effects of COVID-19 on the economy. Furthermore, in both scenarios, a sensitive analysis related to the temporality of the shutdown is considered by assuming 3 and 6 months of shutdown. The results indicate a reduction of 3.78% in the national GDP growth rate in Scenario 1 and a reduction of 0.48% in Scenario 2, in 2020, with 3 months of shutdown. With 6 months, the reduction would be greater, 10.90% and 7.64% in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the government fiscal stimulus considered in this study partially mitigates the reduction in GDP projected under the COVID-19 outbreak. The study also presents sectoral projections at the national and state levels. The estimates indicate reductions in the GDP of most of Brazilian states in both scenarios. © 2020 The Author(s).

In a previous paper, it was noted that a country's failure to dampen a first wave of infection or the recurrence of a second wave would serve as disincentives for greatly needed tourists in summer 2020 and would further significantly reduce tourism revenues and potentially accelerate job losses and bankruptcies in affected countries. Countries in the first wave of infection would need to restrain COVID-19 spread swiftly in order to benefit from summer 2020 tourism. Countries that had controlled COVID-19 and who experienced second waves would manifest the same negative effects. In the case of Malta, up to the beginning of July, the country had the lowest COVID-19 numbers in Europe but this ended abruptly when two mass events took place. In a fortnight, the steep escalation of cases led to a downgrade of the country's status to a high-risk destination, with a host of European countries enacting quarantine measures. The Maltese government re-imposed restrictions and COVID-19 numbers slowly started to temporarily decline. As an economy, Malta is highly dependent on the tourism industry, with approximately 17% of GDP reliant on this sector, directly and indirectly. Malta's red listing wrought a heavy toll on the industry. The World Health Organisation has mandated clear criteria for the release of restrictions and this sequence of events should serve as a cautionary tale: heed the advice of our public health colleagues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. COVID-19; Economics; Internet; Recession; Tourism  COVID-19: Combined supply-side and demand-side shocks, so lift restrictions (carefully) lest GPD declines ultimately kill more than COVID-19 COVID-19 remains pandemic. Social distancing and travel restrictions have avoided countless deaths and infections but disrupted livelihoods and economies. The global loss of gross (world) product is unprecedented as COVID-19 has inflicted both a supply-side and a demand-side shock. While public health measures have mitigated morbidity and mortality, the excessive loss of GDP will lead to years of life lost due to recession with diminished spend on healthcare, safety and the environment. This paper will review the estimated COVID-19 economic impact and show that it is timely and crucial to (carefully) ease restrictions as any additional economic slide will continue to intensify an already parlous situation and further negatively impact overall global average human life expectancy. The USA and UK will be used as specific examples, as will the general case of delayed cancer treatment due to COVID-19 service disruption. Financial stimuli that attempt to revive flagging economies by governments and blocs will be outlined and the current uniformly bleak global forecasts will be briefly contrasted with the Great Depression of the 1930s. The biased adverse impact on low-income households will be sketched, and a reminder of the unknown eventual costs of lasting illness (“long COVID”) will also have to be factored in restriction removal policies. At this point in time (end of summer 2020), fierce debates rage within each country regarding the potential trade-offs of health vs economy. The need for unbiased and rigorous quantitative evaluations of all possible decisions is paramount. © 2020 COVID-19; Depression; Economics; Health economics; Recession  Covid-19: Perspectives and vulnerability [Covid-19: Perspectivas e vulnerabilidade] [CoViD-19: Perspectivas y vulnerabilidad] Coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread worldwide as a pandemic. It is noteworthy that CoViD-19 surpassed the health care system in many countries, due to the speed of its spread and the lack of foresight at the health level, as well as the underestimation of its contagiousness. Furthermore, being a new and unknown nosological entity, there are still no treatments that have been proven to be scientifically effective, safe; as well as a vaccine that will not destroy the pandemic. Therefore, the only response so far has been to try to limit the spread of the disease through good hygiene practices and social distancing. All this has caused the closure of the main parts of the economy and sudden high unemployment, causing negative consequences and a recession never seen before. The most widely adopted strategies have involved the epidemiological approach of promoting good hygiene practices and social distancing, including shelter-in-place and quarantine orders. These strategies have had varying degrees of success depending on the country. The common phrase used to describe the objective of this epidemiological approach is to flatten the curve, an effect that is achieved by reducing the number of infections. This approach was also a way to buy time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways of treatment, prepare health systems, that is, develop validated therapies and vaccines. Another approach would be to re-establish the economy more quickly and thus help the entire population avoid the profound adverse effects of a severe recession or depression on society and health; As well as, it would increase community immunity, lowering the risk for everyone, including those most susceptible to serious adverse outcomes, and those who develop immunity could donate serum fortified with antibodies, which could provide effective treatment as they develop and try vaccines and effective treatments to fight the disease. The balance between the strategies of the epidemiological approach to attenuate the contagion curve and the attempt to reopen a population and its economy will be the key to a successful future. This article was written with the hope of helping professionals understand the problems caused by CoViD-19. © 2020 Silver Horse.

Initial evidence from regions in nine EU countries The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was brought to the global spotlight in early 2020 and has already had significant impacts on daily life, while the effects could last for a long period. However, these impacts appear to have been regionally differentiated, since similar to previous pandemics, geography plays an important role in viruses' diffusion. This paper enriches our knowledge about the initial territorial impact of the pandemic, from January to May 2020, studying the spread of COVID-19 across 119 regional economies in nine EU countries and explaining its underlying factors. Air quality, demographics, global interconnectedness, urbanization trends, historic trends in health expenditure as well as the policies implemented to mitigate the pandemic were found to have influenced the regionally uneven mortality rate of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

Moreover, as a result of the societal distress engendered, they become less effective over time, reflected in reducing acceptability, public protests, lack of compliance and civil disobedience, as evidenced by current events in some countries. There is an urgent need to evolve new containment strategies that minimize civil liberty restrictions. This requires strategic economic policies to invest in what might be termed pandemic containment innovation, particularly in the development of new means of reducing virus concentrations in closed spaces, and of precision exclusion of virus transmitters from public assemblies. Such innovations and their implementation will in turn create significant employment and boost economies. And, because such investments aim at increasing the resilience of society, healthcare and the economy to pandemics (and indeed outbreaks of respiratory infections in general), they are particularly sustainable. © 2020 The Author.

Lifting lockdown policies: A critical moment for COVID-19 stigma COVID-19 ‘lockdown’ policies may have unintended consequences for individuals, households and country economies. Hence lockdown may be unsustainable despite the risk of a resurgence of new COVID-19 infections. The repeal and alteration of lockdown policies mark a symbolic transfer of responsibility for epidemic control from state to individual. This has the potential to catalyse fear, blame and judgement within and between populations. We draw on experience from the HIV pandemic to show that this will worsen during later phases of the pandemic if COVID-19 stigma increases, as we fear it could. We suggest policy recommendations for ‘lockdown lifting’ to limit COVID-19 stigma. We suggest three policy priorities to minimise potential increases in COVID-19 stigma: limit fear by strengthening risk communication, engage communities to reduce the emergence of blaming, and emphasise social justice to reduce judgement. ‘Lockdown’ policies cannot continue uninterrupted. However, lifting lockdown without unintended consequences may prove harder than establishing it. This period has the potential to see the emergence of fear, blame and judgement, intersecting with existing inequalities, as governments seek to share responsibility for preventing further Sars-Cov-2 transmission. As we have learned from HIV, it is critical that a wave of COVID-19 stigma is prevented from flourishing. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. community; COVID-19; human rights; public health; stigma  Analytical Methods on Determination in Pharmaceuticals and Biological Materials of Chloroquine as Available for the Treatment of COVID-19 With the outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COVID-19), people’s health and existing economies on a global scale are seriously threatened. Currently, most of the countries all over the world are studying extensively to better understand the antimalarial chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for therapeutic purposes due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, CQ and HCQ can have serious side effects, from psychiatric effects to sudden death. Therefore, a faster and more effective detection method is needed to monitor drug concentrations. In this review, a large study was conducted on the detection techniques and quantitative determination methods of CQ and its related metabolites. In this review, chromatography, electrophoresis, electroanalytical, spectroscopic, and immunological methods for CQ and related metabolites are discussed extensively. It is hoped that a better understanding of the CQ used for therapeutic purposes in the COVID-19 outbreak will be provided. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The adoption of a preventive measure is required to control the spread. This research explores the impact of influencing factors like COVID-19 knowledge, behavioral control, moral and subject norms, preventive e-guidelines by the government, and environmental factors on the intention to prevent COVID-19 and risk aversion. A cross-sectional study was performed of 310 respondents about different COVID-19 related influencing factors in Pakistan. The partial least square-structural equation modeling was applied to estimate the path coefficient. Moral and subject norms (0.359) had a comparatively higher path coefficient. Other influencing factors/drivers were preventive e-guideline by the government (0.215) followed by COVID-19 knowledge (0.197), and behavioral control (0.121). The intention to prevent COVID-19 showed a positive and significant impact (0.705) on risk aversion. The indirect analysis also confirmed that the positive influence of moral and subject norms, COVID-19 knowledge, preventive e-guideline by the government, and behavioral control on risk aversion. However, the path coefficient of environmental factors was negative but insignificant, which implies than environmental factors do not influence the intention to prevent COVID-19. It is suggested to provide clear guidelines using print, social, electronic media. It is also suggested to provide e-guidelines in local languages. The COVID-19 knowledge about its transmission, symptoms, and precautions is also useful. It is suggested to include the causes, symptoms, and precaution of viral diseases in the educational syllabus. The government should ensure the availability of preventive medical items like surgical masks and sanitizers to meet the demand of the public. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The tendency to confront these pandemics is still questionable. In January 2020, the first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in India was identified in Kerala. Later, the Indian government announced lockdown as a remedial action against COVID-19. The present work aims to elucidate the community behavioural response towards COVID-19 lockdown in India and presents comprehensive observations. Protection motivational theory has been used to build a conceptual framework. It was observed that community behavioural response includes maladaptive, adaptive and prosocial behaviours. In addition, we conclude that the effective strategy against the prevention, spread and control of pandemics and strategic management is still lacking. Hence, we propose a framework based on the learnings from COVID-19 to tackle future pandemics. © The Author(s) 2020.

The latter includes the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in clinical practice and research. We report a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on the use of clinical EEG in practice and research in several countries, and the recommendations of an international panel of experts for the safe application of EEG during and after this pandemic. Methods: Fifteen clinicians from 8 different countries and 25 researchers from 13 different countries reported the impact of COVID-19 on their EEG activities, the procedures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and precautions planned or already implemented during the reopening of EEG activities. Results: Of the 15 clinical centers responding, 11 reported a total stoppage of all EEG activities, while 4 reduced the number of tests per day. In research settings, all 25 laboratories reported a complete stoppage of activity, with 7 laboratories reopening to some extent since initial closure. In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings. The continued use of EEG is important in those with psychiatric diseases, particularly in times of social alarm such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2020.

Since the Indian economy was experiencing sluggish growth on the eve of the Covid-19 outbreak, the economic downturn could be severe, and the policy intervention would require a careful weighing of options and priorities. Given that policy space and resources are limited, policies that help manage the short-run crisis and yield significant long-run benefits should receive serious consideration. © 2020, ACCB Publishing.

Methods: Epidemiological, business and economic data were extracted from official government sources covering the period 31st January to 13th August 2020; healthcare system data up to end of June 2019. Results: UK-wide COVID-19 cases and deaths were 313,798 and 46,706 respectively (472 cases and 70 deaths per 100,000 population) by 12th August. There were regional variations in England, with London and North West (756 and 666 cases per 100,000 population respectively) disproportionately affected compared with other regions. As of 11th August, 13,618,470 tests had been conducted in the UK. Increased risk of mortality was associated with age (≥60 years), gender (male) and BAME groups. Since onset of the pandemic, emergency department attendance, primary care utilisation and cancer referrals and inpatient/outpatient referrals have declined; emergency ambulance and NHS111 calls increased. Business sectors most impacted are the arts, entertainment and recreation, followed by accommodation and food services. Government interventions aimed at curtailing the business and economic impact have been implemented, but applications for state benefits have increased. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19 on the UK population, health system and economy has been profound. More data are needed to implement the optimal policy and technological responses to preventing further spikes in COVID-19 cases, and to inform strategic planning to manage future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Economic impact; Epidemiology; Health system impact; Technological response; United Kingdom  Pandemics, tourism and global change: a rapid assessment of COVID-19 The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is challenging the world. With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the main strategy to contain the pandemic. Unprecedented global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders are causing the most severe disruption of the global economy since World War II. With international travel bans affecting over 90% of the world population and wide-spread restrictions on public gatherings and community mobility, tourism largely ceased in March 2020. Early evidence on impacts on air travel, cruises, and accommodations have been devastating. While highly uncertain, early projections from UNWTO for 2020 suggest international arrivals could decline by 20 to 30% relative to 2019. Tourism is especially susceptible to measures to counteract pandemics because of restricted mobility and social distancing. The paper compares the impacts of COVID-19 to previous epidemic/pandemics and other types of global crises and explores how the pandemic may change society, the economy, and tourism. It discusses why COVID-19 is an analogue to the ongoing climate crisis, and why there is a need to question the volume growth tourism model advocated by UNWTO, ICAO, CLIA, WTTC and other tourism organizations. © 2020 The Author(s).

Data on the effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 remain limited. Methods: In this retrospective study, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcomes data of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to 7 March 2020, were collected. Binary logistic regression model was used to analyse risk factors for disease progression from severe COVID-19 illness to critical illness. The effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 disease were evaluated. Results: The results of the multivariate analysis from 175 patients with severe COVID-19 indicate that the use of methylprednisolone was a protective factor against disease progression from severe to critical illness(P &lt;.001; OR: 0.054 95% CI: 0.017-0.173). Among patients with severe COVID-19 aged &lt; 65 years, both the proportion of patients who progressed to critical illness (42.2% vs 90.0%, P =.000) and the mortality(6.7% vs 30.0%, P =.002) were lower for patients in methylprednisolone group, compared with those in the non-methylprednisolone group, whereas no statistical differences between the methylprednisolone group and the non-methylprednisolone group were found among patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years. Moreover, both the levels of CD4+ T lymphocyte counts (646 vs 463/µL, P =.007) and IL-6 (241.9 vs 82.8 pg/mL, P =.025) were higher among patients with severe COVID-19 aged &lt; 65 years, compared with those patients ≥ 65 years old. Conclusion: Data from the limited sample showed that the early use of low or medium doses of methylprednisolone has a positive effect for patients with severe COVID-19 younger than 65 years old, and excessive immune response and cytokine storm may be some of the reasons for the effectiveness. © 2020 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation COVID-19; cytokine storm; methylprednisolone; prognosis; SARS-CoV-2  Evaluating the plausible application of advanced machine learnings in exploring determinant factors of present pandemic: A case for continent specific COVID-19 analysis Coronavirus disease, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COVID-19), has become a global health concern due to its unpredictable nature and lack of adequate medicines. Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research. Additionally, all the models and data used in this study are open source and freely available, thereby, reproducibility and scientific replication will be achievable easily. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on 56 global stock indices from October 15, 2019 to August 7, 2020 by using a complex network method. Furthermore, the change of the network structure is analyzed in depth by dividing the stock markets into developed, emerging and frontier markets. The findings reveal a structural change in the form of node changes, reduced connectivity and significant differences in the topological characteristics of the network, due to COVID-19. A contagion effect is also identified in the network structure of emerging markets, with the nodes behaving synchronously. The findings also reveal substantial clustering and homogeneity in the world stock market network, based on geographic positioning. Besides, the number of positive correlations in the global stock indices increased during the outbreak. The stock markets of France and Germany seem to be the most relevant developed markets, while Taiwan and Slovenia have this relevance in emerging and frontier markets. The findings of this study help regulators and practitioners to design important strategies in the light of varying stock market dynamics during COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Minimum spanning tree; Network; Network topology; Stock markets  Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards covid-19 pandemic among quarantined adults in Tigrai region, Ethiopia Background: With the onset of any novel condition, it is the “first” case identified that brings attention and sets into motion the machinery to respond – so it began with a first novel pneumonia case of unknown origin in Wuhan, China. Currently, the World Health Organization has declared SARS-CoV-2 (more commonly known as COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern. It is projected that the path of COVID-19 could kill 50–80 million people and impacts the world’s economy in its devastating global sweep. The surge is increasing on global and national levels, causing rapid loss of life, joblessness, deterioration of the healthcare systems, and both national and global economies. In Ethiopia, the first COVID-19 case was reported in March. Since then, the government has been taking different measures to prevent its spread. Locking down all schools, declared social distancing and hand hygiene, and restricting large gatherings were some of the Ethiopian government’s actions. Objective: To determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 pandemic among quarantined adults in Tigrai region, Ethiopia. Methods: A total of 331 participants selected using a systematic random sampling method were included in the study. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire. After describing the variables using frequencies, means, and standard deviations, multivariable logistic regression determined factors associated with knowledge and chi-squared tests for attitudes and practices towards COVID-19. Results: The study participants were primarily males (70%) and mean age 30.5 (SD=11) years. The mean knowledge score was 8.73 (SD=2.64), with less than half 42.9% (95% CI: 37.5–48%) of the study participants were knowledgeable. Regarding the attitude questions, three-fourths of the participants believed that Ethiopia will control and win the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly one-third of the participants replied that the Ethiopian government is handling this pandemic health crisis well. About half of the study participants reported that they had gone to crowded places in recent days, did not wear face mask when leaving home, and practiced preventive measures given by local health authorities. Knowledge score was statistically significantly associated with gender, age, and educational status of the study participants, whereas attitude and practices were significantly associated with educational status and knowledge of participants. © 2020 Haftom et al.

It can manifest with a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia or even fatality. One of the treatments suggested is convalescent plasma therapy. The study aims at assessing the general awareness about Covid-19 and knowledge about the role of Convalescent plasma therapy for treatment of Covid-19 among post graduate dental students. The survey was conducted among postgraduate dental students through an online survey tool using google forms. The survey was conducted online among postgraduate dental students on the go with 19 and convalescent plasma therapy.A total of 103 participant were included in the study. The responses were collected, tabulated and analysed using SPSS software. The knowledge regarding covid-19 and the awareness about the usefulness of convalescent plasma was variable. Around 90% of the participants were aware of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy. Advance training, proper PPE and training on handling the patients with any infectious disease should be dealt with in detail for reducing the spread from dental clinics and dentists. © 2020 Global Research Online.

In India, it has become a public health disaster and its' intensity increasing continuously. For the disaster risk reduction, and capacity building against the COVID-19 pandemic understanding of the relationship between socio-environmental conditions with the pandemic is very necessary. The objective of the present work is to construct a socio-environmental vulnerability index of the potential risk of community spread of COVID-19 using socio-economic and environmental variables. Methodology: In this, cross-sectional study principal component analyses have been used to drive SoEVI. 4 uncorrelated sub-index has been extracted from 16 sub-indicators which reflects 59% of the variance. Aggregation of 4 Sub-Index has been done to obtain the final vulnerability Index. Results: Results show that there is spatial variability in vulnerability based on environmental and socio-economic conditions. Districts of north and central India found more vulnerable then south India. Statistical significance has been tested using regression analysis, positive relation has been found between vulnerability index and confirmed and active cases. Conclusion: The vulnerability index has highlighted environmentaly and socioeconomicallybackward districts. These areas will suffer more critical problems against COVID-19 pandemic for their socio-environmental problem. © 2020 INDIACLEN Community risk; Composite index; COVID-19; Pandemic; Vulnerability  Antibody tests for COVID-19 The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused a globally growing pandemic called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has disrupted social, political, and medical environments around the world. Nations are assessing ways to reopen businesses while trying to balance health care risks and economic fallouts. Strategies involving antibody testing have been proposed before phased reopening of the economy. Therefore, assessing the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients remains paramount to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 detect the presence of IgA, IgM, or IgG antibodies produced by B cells. There are four major types of antibody tests: rapid diagnostic tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, neutralization assays, and chemiluminescent immunoassays. Currently, there is no standard antibody test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during or after exposure or infection. The antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 have a low specificity within the first week of exposure and increase in the second and third weeks. The current data on antibody tests have several limitations in quality and the presence of bias. Specifically, many antibody tests have a high false-negative rate and a high risk of bias for participant selection, application of index tests, reference standard used, and flow and timing for antibody tests that may incorrectly report the accuracy of COVID-19 antibody tests. In this review, we summarize the current methods, sensitivity/specificity, and gaps in knowledge concerning COVID-19 antibody testing. © Copyright © 2020 Baylor University Medical Center.

This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among a representative sample of home-quarantined Bangladeshi adults. A cross-sectional design was used with an online survey completed by a convenience sample recruited via social media. A total of 1,427 respondents were recruited, and their mental health was assessed by the DASS-21 measure. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 33.7% and 57.9%, respectively, and 59.7% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental health outcomes. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that sociodemographic factors and perceptions of COVID-19 significantly predict mental health outcomes. These findings warrant the consideration of easily accessible low-intensity mental health interventions during and beyond this pandemic. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2 weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, an inverted demand function for housing is augmented to include a residential market activity variable and estimate the impact on house prices of the decline in economic activity due to the virus-related measures. The likely future path of house prices based on two different recovery scenarios is also examined. Under both scenarios house prices are forecast to decline in the near term. Findings: The scenario analysis presented here indicates that Irish house prices are set to fall over the next 18 months as a result of the Covid-19 downturn. This contraction in prices is due to the decline in household disposable income and the sharp fall-off in mortgage market activity, which will inevitably result from the administrative closedown implemented by the Irish authorities. Originality/value: As such the approach builds on several studies which have examined both house price movements in general and the relationship between house prices and mortgage credit availability. The paper also draws on the latest analysis of the implications for the Irish economy of Covid-19 and the related administrative closure methods introduced by the public authorities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The analysis includes the computations of lag correlations between confirmed cases and Google data, Granger causality tests, and an out-of-sample forecasting exercise with 18 competing models with a forecast horizon of 14 days ahead. This evidence shows that Google-augmented models outperform the competing models for most of the countries. This is significant because Google data can complement epidemiological models during difficult times like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, when official statistics maybe not fully reliable and/or published with a delay. Moreover, real-time tracking with online-data is one of the instruments that can be used to keep the situation under control when national lockdowns are lifted and economies gradually reopen. © 2020 Sinergia Press.

For some, location-aware applications are primarily a producer of geospatial Big Data required for vital geospatial analysis and visualization of the spread of the disease in a state of emergency. For others, comprehensive tracking of citizens constitutes a dangerous violation of fundamental rights. Commercial web-based location-aware applications both collect data and—through spatial analysis and connection to services—provide value to users. This value is what motivates users to share increasingly private and comprehensive data. The willingness of users to share data in return for services has been a key concern with web-based variants of the technology since the beginning. With a focus on two privacy preserving CoViD-19 contact tracking applications, this survey walks through the key steps of developing a privacy preserving context-aware application: from types of applications and business models, through architectures and privacy strategies, to representations. © 2020, The Author(s).

The research illustrates that the effects of the pandemic are strongly felt in mobility in the socio-economic sectors. Design/Methodology/Approach: To give answer to the research question whether COVID-19 pandemic has impact on socio-economic mobility in Indonesia, firstly, we review the literature to find out what different scholars have found in recent researches concerning this subject as well as the current issue and the methods and models used in collecting, processing, and analyzing data. The processing of the data of the above-mentioned reports has been done by SPSS software program, specifically using regression. Findings: The possible impacts caused a decrease in socio-economic activities and reduced community income. The results of the correlation analysis showed that there was a strong relationship between a pandemic tested positive for COVID-19 and mortality rates with socio-economic conditions with an average correlation coefficient above 0.80. Practical Implications: This paper will provide a detail analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic mobility, with this impact, government policies relating to human life, economic policies to increase state expenditure (government expenditure), and tax incentives must be made. Furthermore, monetary policy that can accelerate the increase in production by reducing the cost of production through the cost of capital and reduce energy prices becomes an essential choice. Originality/Value: This research paper highlights an empirical analysis based on real data of socio economy mobility in Indonesia. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

Correlation coefficient; COVID-19 pandemic; Socio-economic mobility  Beef and Pork Marketing Margins and Price Spreads during COVID-19 COVID-19-related disruptions led to a historic rise in the spread between livestock and wholesale meat prices. Concerns about concentration and allegations of anticompetitive behavior have led to several inquiries and civil suits by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Justice, with increases in price differentials serving as a focal point. This article notes the difference between price spreads and marketing margins, outlines corresponding economic theory, and describes the empirical evidence on wholesale meat and livestock price dynamics in the wake of COVID-19 disruptions. At one point during the pandemic, beef and pork packers were both operating at about 60% of the previous year's processing volume. We explore how such a massive supply shock would be expected to affect marketing margins even in the absence of anticompetitive behavior. Moreover, we document how margin measurements are critically sensitive to the selection of data and information utilized. Finally, we conclude with some discussion around policy proposals that would pit industry concentration against industry coordination and economies of scale. © 2020 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association Beef; Cattle; COVID-19; Hog; Marketing Margin; Pork; Price Spread; Q11; Q13  Diagnostic characteristics of serological-based COVID-19 testing: A systematic review and meta-analysis Serologic testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) promises to assist in assessing exposure to and confirming the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to provide a roadmap for reopening countries worldwide. Considering this, a proper understanding of serologic-based diagnostic testing characteristics is critical. The aim of this study was to perform a structured systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic characteristics of serological-based COVID-19 testing. Electronic searches were performed using Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Full-text observational studies that reported IgG or IgM diagnostic yield and used nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) of respiratory tract specimens, as a the reference standard in English language were included. A bivariate model was used to compute pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratio (LR), diagnostic odds ratio (OR), and summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Five studies (n=1,166 individual tests) met inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for IgG was 81% [(95% CI, 61-92);I2=95.28], 97% [(95% CI, 78-100);I2=97.80], and 93% (95% CI, 91-95), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for IgM antibodies was 80% [(95% CI, 57-92);I2=94.63], 96% [(95% CI, 81-99);I2=92.96] and 95% (95% CI, 92-96). This meta-analysis demonstrates suboptimal sensitivity and specificity of serologic-based diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 and suggests that antibody testing alone, in its current form, is unlikely to be an adequate solution to the difficulties posed by COVID-19 and in guiding future policy decisions regarding social distancing and reopening of the economy worldwide. © 2020 CLINICS.

Comparatively, there are more success stories by SMEs in emerging markets. However, most SMEs operating in the informal sector in the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) face similar challenges that inhibit the adoption of advanced technologies and innovations needed to improve business operations and re-engineer processes. This article evaluates the implementation and use of state-of-the-art technologies by SMEs in EMDEs to improve operations performance and create sustainable competitive advantages. Further, the papers in this Special Issue identify FinTech and analytical algorithms as some of the current technologies employed by SMEs in EMDEs to improve operations and processes in the manufacturing and service industries. The recognized technologies and technical innovations that seem novel in EMDEs have long existed in the advanced economies. Most state-of-the-art technologies, including cloud computing, 'big data', and predictive analytics that can improve operations and strategic decisions, are yet to make inroads in most EMDEs. Also, disruptive computing technologies, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) required to engineer new business models, reduce overheads, enhance competitive advantages, and digitize SMEs' business operations remain untapped. The absence and non-adoption of digital technologies in EMDEs explain why business activities in most EMDEs remain shut during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the community lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies to survive the 'new normal' imposed by COVID-19 and fierce global competition includes a successful adoption of advanced technologies. © 2020 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.

Aftermath of outbreak of this disease at the global level is more frightening and panicking than anyone’s worst nightmare. With more than 23 mln positive coronavirus cases and more than 800,000 causalities all over the world, the potential of this virus cannot be undermined. This pandemic has victimized all human beings residing on 209 countries and territories of the world. It emerged as an unbeatable global challenge that the world has never witnessed before. Consequently, the affected countries have sealed their borders and made populations reside in their homes until the pandemic is over. Thus, the victims of coronavirus are not only the ones who are exposed to it but also the ones who are affected by the lockdown imposed by the governments. The paper aims to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on air pollution of various countries. Papers indicating the relationship between air pollution levels and lockdown measures are analyzed. The dramatic U-turn from environmental degradation is definitely a silver lining in these black clouds. This paper reviews the repercussions of the pandemic in some nations, while war-like preparations continue to fight it. COVID-19 has dramatically improved the quality of air. Also, it has greatly affected the economy of various countries due to lockdown. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

For example, South Korea has been criticised for its use of privacy-infringing digital contact-tracing. However, whether their type of digital contact-tracing was unnecessarily harmful to the human rights of Korean citizens is open for debate. The purpose of this paper is to examine this criticism to see if Korea’s digital contact-tracing is ethically justifiable. Design/methodology/approach: This paper will evaluate Korea’s digital contact-tracing through the lens of the four human rights principles to determine if their response is ethically justifiable. These four principles were originally outlined in the European Court of Human Rights, namely, necessary, proportional, scientifically valid and time-bounded (European Court of Human Rights 1950). Findings: The paper will propose that while the use of Korea’s digital contact-tracing was scientifically valid and proportionate (albeit, in need for improvements), it meets the necessity requirement, but is too vague to meet the time-boundedness requirement. Originality/value: The Covid-19 pandemic has proven to be one of the worst threats to human health and the global economy in the past century. There have been many different strategies to tackle the pandemic, from somewhat laissez-faire approaches, herd immunity, to strict draconian measures. Analysis of the approaches taken in the response to the pandemic is of high scientific value and this paper is one of the first to critically engage with one of these methods – digital contact-tracing in South Korea. © 2020, Mark Ryan.

The end of an expansionary cycle of the economy, added to a very weak social structure, with unresolved pressing needs, does not represent the best scenario to confront the health alert situation. The objective of this work is to reflect on these aspects, warning of the absence of a solid regional architecture and its consequences. For this, the work reviews all the regional schemes of the continent and analyzes the way in which multilateral spaces have been arranged for joint decision-making. Thus, except for the Central American Integration System and the Pan American Health Organization, it is scarcely possible to find regional commitments beyond the exchange of information or concern about economic recovery. © 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Methods: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non–intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. Results: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. Conclusions: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model–projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available. Despite evolving differences between government policy and Imperial model–projected suppression policy, it is hoped this article will provide some early insight into the trade-offs that are involved. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research coronavirus; cost-effectiveness; COVID-19; economic evaluation; mitigation; suppression; United Kingdom  The cross-impact between financial markets, Covid-19 pandemic, and economic sanctions: The case of Iran The main financial markets in the Iranian Economy include the stock exchange, foreign exchange, oil, and gold markets. The sharp fluctuations in these markets, especially those caused by the severe sanctions imposed on Iran in May 2018, and the pandemic outbreak of Covid-19 have led to more confusion and uncertainty among investors. One of the effective approaches to examine such unstable conditions is to study the co-movement(s) between markets to identify the leading variable(s). Thus, in the present study, Wavelet Coherence Analysis was applied to examine the co-movements between markets in a time period from September 2014 to June 2020, as an intense period of uncertainty in Iran. In other words, in this study, the markets were investigated in different sub-periods. Also, the Segmented Regression was performed to estimate the impact of sanctions and the Covid-19 pandemic on the co-movements of financial markets in Iran. The results showed that the oil price had a low co-movement with the other three markets, i.e. stock exchange, exchange rate, and gold markets. Thus, the oil market can be a suitable alternative for risk aversion investors. Meanwhile, the oil market could also act as a source of finance for the government during the sanctions period. That possibly explains the recent decision by the Iranian government to use the oil market to finance its budget deficit. Between the exchange rate and gold price, the gold price was identified as the leading variable. While the exchange rate and gold price did not show a significant co-movement in stable conditions, they did show a significant co-movement in unstable conditions, as in times of sanctions or during a global pandemic and thus influenced the investors’ portfolio risk. This result is important from a policy-making perspective. Based on this result, the policymakers can, especially during crises and unstable conditions, control the gold market and make it more stable by managing the foreign exchange market. © 2020 The Society for Policy Modeling Covid-19; Economic sanctions; Financial markets; Iran; Wavelet coherence  War economy and the COVID-19 pandemic: Inequalities in stimulus packages as an additional challenge for health systems [краткое описание не найдено]  coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; financial deficit; funding; gross national product; health care system; health insurance; health workforce; hospital bed capacity; household; housing; human; income; industrial production; intensive care unit; isolation; learning; leishmaniasis; leprosy; Letter; low income country; middle income country; military phenomena; pandemic; poverty; sanitation; schistosomiasis; social distance; telemedicine; tourism; tuberculosis; unemployment; war economy; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; economics; health care planning; health care policy; organization and management; pandemic; socioeconomics; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Policy; Health Systems Plans; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Socioeconomic Factors Evidence of initial success for China exiting COVID-19 social distancing policy after achieving containment Background: The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a Global Pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. By 24 March 2020, over 440,000 cases and almost 20,000 deaths had been reported worldwide. In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces. These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear. Methods: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity. Results: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharp fall in transmissibility. In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement. A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak. At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission. Conclusions: Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree. Elsewhere, movement data are being used as proxies for economic activity to assess the impact of interventions. The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies. © 2020 Ainslie KEC et al. COVID-19; Exit strategy; Social distancing; Transmission  Forecasting for COVID-19 has failed Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track-record, and its failures became more prominent with COVID-19. Poor data input, wrong modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, poor past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, consideration of only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand, lack of expertise in crucial disciplines, groupthink and bandwagon effects, and selective reporting are some of the causes of these failures. Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making. When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters Bayesian models; Bias; COVID-19; Forecasting; Hospital bed utilization; Mortality; SIR models; Validation  Can India stay immune enough to combat COVID-19 pandemic? An economic query The COVID-19 pandemic has affected different sectors of the economy in an unprecedented way, and this article is an attempt to analyze the economic effect of the outbreak in India. However, before we assess the economic cost associated with the pandemic, we economists fully consider the outbreak as a human tragedy. There has not been any econometric technique that can account the countless human sufferings that the crisis has brought. Through this article, we address several important research questions and demonstrate India's strength to stay immune to combat COVID-19 pandemic. The research questions are as follows. First, what will be the effect of COVID-19 on the Indian economy and how does it affect the different sectors of the economy? Second, how does the pandemic affect the bilateral trade relation between India and China? Third, we question the role of the public health system in dealing with the outbreak of the virus in India. This article also presents the growth projection of the Indian economy by different economic agents. We finally conclude the article by mentioning a few policy recommendations for the Indian economy. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd   The impact of COVID-19 on gender inequality in the labor market and gender-role attitudes COVID-19 and ensuing changes in mobility have altered employment relations for millions of people across the globe. Emerging evidence shows that women may be more severely affected by this change. The pandemic, however, may have an impact beyond the immediate restructuring of employment and shift gender-role attitudes within households as a result of changes in the division of household labor. We analyze a representative sample of respondents in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore and show that transitions to unemployment, reductions in working hours and transitions to working from home have been more frequent for women than for men–although not to the same extent across the three countries. We also demonstrate that among couples who had been employed at the start of the pandemic, men express more egalitarian gender-role attitudes if they became unemployed but their partners remained employed, while women express more traditional attitudes if they became unemployed and their partners remained employed. These results indicate that gender-role attitudes might adapt to the lived realities. The long-term consequences will depend on how both men and women experience further shifts in their employment relations as economies recover. © 2020 The Author(s).

First, they must design policies that improve the tradeoff between economic activity and health outcomes. Second, they must design policies to reduce the long-run damage that a COVID-19 induced recession inflicts on the economy. This paper briefly discusses appropriate responses to those challenges. © 2020, Bank of Israel.

In this paper, economic systems dominated by a capital accumulating growth imperative are shown to have had their structural weaknesses exposed, revealing numerous problems including unstable supply chains, unjust social provisioning of essentials, profiteering, precarious employment, inequities and pollution. Such phenomena must be understood in the context of long standing critiques relating to the limits of economic systems, their consumerist values and divorce from biophysical reality. Critical reflection on the Coronavirus pandemic is combined with a review of how economists have defended economic growth as sustainable, Green and inclusive regardless of systemic limits and multiple crises–climate emergency, economic crash and pandemic. Instead of rebuilding the old flawed political economy again, what the world needs now is a more robust, just, ethical and equitable social-ecological economy. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions as well as the underlying economic policies behind the loans that IFIs are granting to States are studied, identifying clear signals that fiscal discipline and pro-market options will continue being the priorities as soon as the emergency has been overcome. The study explains how the adjustment and austerity policies implemented in the countries in the region have adversely and disproportionally affected women's rights, in particular reinforcing the invisibilization of gender inequalities in the domestic and care work and how this situation, in turn, has put women in a situation of greater vulnerability to the pandemic. It also criticizes the (self)called ""gender approach"" of IFIs for being merely instrumental to economic growth without consideration to the intrinsic value of gender equality and women's rights. The responsibility of IFIs for complicity with economic reforms with known adverse effects on gender equality is studied. Given the policy and legal implications of the findings presented in this research, the article concludes that States in the region should consider carefully the conditions of the loans being offered by IFIs, for which it is crucial to conduct ex ante evaluations of the impact of these financial contacts on the human rights of the population, and in particular on gender equality. © Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

By May 17, 2020 this number increased to 315,005. The risk of death is higher above the age of 60, but there are many deaths below 60 (for example, in Sao Paulo, 25%). Due to the lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, there are at least three types of interventions used in the first wave of this pandemic: increased alertness and hygiene (e.g. Sweden); identification and isolation of infected people and their contacts (e.g. South Korea); lockdown (e.g. Italy). These interventions are complementary. Choices of the right mix of interventions will vary from society to society and in the same society at different times. The search for a miracle drug is dangerous because it is based on the mistaken belief that any treatment option is better than ""nothing"". Brazilian society will not be able to maintain lockdown for a long period. Naturally, in the near future, regardless of the advice from scientists, doctors and authorities, commerce, services and schools will reopen. In order to implement any strategy aimed to control the pandemic and preserve the economy, the country needs leadership that centralizes and coordinates actions. Unfortunately, the Brazilian government is not fulfilling this role; on the contrary, it is a hindrance. This negative leadership and lack of coordination are causing many deaths and are severely damaging the lives of survivors by delaying the resuming of economic and social activities. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia.

Methods: Based on “fearonomic effects,” a qualitative framework that conceptualizes the direct and indirect economic effects caused by the fear of contagion, we created a checklist to facilitate empirical estimation. As a case study, we first identified relevant sectors affected by China's lockdown policies implemented just before the Lunar New Year (LNY) week. To quantify the immediate impact, we then estimated the projected spending levels in 2020 in the absence of COVID-19 and compared these projections with actual spending during the LNY week. Data sources used include Chinese and global websites. To characterize uncertainty, we reported upper and lower bound estimates and calculated midpoints for each range. Results: The COVID-19 epidemic is estimated to cost China's economy $283 billion ($196-369 billion), that is, ¥2.0 trillion renminbi (¥1.4-¥2.6 trillion), during the LNY week. Reduced restaurant and movie theater business ($106 [$103-$109] billion, 37.5% [36.4%-38.5%]) and reduced public transportation utilization ($96 [$13-$179] billion dollars, 33.9% [4.6%-63.3%]) explain most of this loss, followed by travel restrictions and the resulting loss of hotel business and tourism ($80.36 billion, 28.4%). Conclusion: Our checklist can help quantify the immediate and near-term impact of COVID-19 on a country's economy. It can also help researchers and policy makers consider the broader economic and social consequences when valuing future vaccines and treatments. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research   A review on scope of immuno-modulatory drugs in Ayurveda for prevention and treatment of Covid-19 The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) infection attacking mainly on the immune system of a body. It is a potentially fatal disease that is of public health and economy concern globally. In December 2019, COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China furthermore spread worldwide. Research is underway in many countries to develop effective vaccines and drugs for the COVID-19. In Ayurveda, Acharya Charaka explained the concept of an epidemic condition in Janapadodhwansa Adhayay and combating of these diseases is to be done by Panchakarma (five procedures of purification), Rasayana Chikitsa (immune-modulators therapy) and Sadvritta (good conduct). Rasayan dravyas (immunomodulator drugs) of Ayurveda can be used for health promotion, immune-modulation, prevention and reduce disease burden from COVID-19. Drugs such as Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers), Amalaki (Phyllanthus emblica L.), Mulethi (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.), Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus Willd.), Chireta (Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum L.) Punarnava (Boerhaavia diffusa L.) and Pippali (Piper longum L.) For symptom management of COVID-19 like illness Agastya Haritaki, Anutaila, AYUSH-64 can be used. Scientific research on these drugs may reveal the new approach for the prevention and management of COVID-19. The main aim of this article is to review research which has already conducted and currently being carried out on the herbal plant for their immunomodulation property which have a possible application in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. © Niraj & Varsha (2020).

All the governments’ primary focus is to save humanity from this pandemic problem, and they have lockdown almost the entire nation to stop the spread of infection. This lockdown resulted in a considerable impact on the global as well as a local economy that will take a long time to perform with business as usual scenario. However, improvement in the air quality of the cities across the globe has emerged as a key benefit of this lockdown. Therefore, this study aims to assess the overall impact of social and travel lockdown in five megacities of India; Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. The study evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in five criteria pollutants over two time periods, i.e., March–April 2019 and March–April 2020 and 10th–20th March 2020 (before lockdown) and 25th March to 6th April 2020 (during lockdown). The results highlighted a statistically significant decline in all the pollutants in all the megacities except for ozone. It was observed that the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO declined by ~41% (66–39 µg m–3), ~52% (153–73 µg m–3), ~51% (39–19 µg m–3) and ~28% (0.9–0.65 mg m–3) during the lockdown phase in comparison to the before lockdown in Delhi, respectively. Similar decline in pollutant concentration was observed in other megacities as well. Further, the study conducted an expert survey to identify the possible challenges India might face after lockdown is over. All the experts said that reviving the economy will be a big challenge for the government, and it may result in some tradeoff while managing the air quality in the near future due to scarcity of funds, etc. © The Author(s).

Converging evidence from the current pandemic, previous outbreaks and controlled experiments indicates that SARS-CoVs are present in wastewater for several days, leading to potential health risks via waterborne and aerosolized wastewater pathways. Conventional wastewater treatment provides only partial removal of SARS-CoVs, thus safe disposal or reuse will depend on the efficacy of final disinfection. This underscores the need for a risk assessment and management framework tailored to SARS-CoV-2 transmission via wastewater, including new tools for environmental surveillance, ensuring adequate disinfection as a component of overall COVID-19 pandemic containment. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

Almost all medical attention and focus is on this infection. Nonetheless, prior to this pandemic NCDs and the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity dominated the global landscape. The aim of this paper is to explore the effect of COVID-19 on NCDs and multimorbidity populations while proposing recommendations to protect this vulnerable population. Methods: A literature search using PubMed and Google scholar was performed using the keywords “COVID-19”, “Vulnerable population”, “Non-communicable diseases” and “Multimorbidity”. Articles found relevant to the scope of the article were considered. Results: Instituted restrictive measures to curb the viral spread led to constraints on wellbeing of the NCDs and multimorbidity population. There was also disruption to access to essential services and screening programmes, and the reduction or cancellation of planned appointments. These individuals have been reported to have a higher risk of a COVID-19 infection and premature mortality. It was also observed that the relaxation of COVID measures led to the spill off of infections among this vulnerable population with a spike in mortality. Conclusions: Changes in COVID-19 policies so as to resuscitate economies are crucial. However, it is paramount that measures to ensure adequate care and protection of the NCDs population are instituted, especially on the eve of the seasonal influenza season. Strategies are recommended to plan for surveillance, risk assessments, follow-ups and prevention of the twofold burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

An online survey was conducted through snowball sampling technique and total 367 people participated in the survey. The results of the study show that COVID-19 cases spiked amid ease of lockdown in the country and the spread of novel coronavirus pandemic has significant socioeconomic impact on the lives of mountain communities in Gilgit-Baltistan. Financial uncertainty, decrease in income, fear of job loss, and food insecurity are some major challenges that mountain communities face due to outbreak of coronavirus in the region. The results further show that lack of community cooperation with government agencies, lack of awareness about the severity of coronavirus, and insufficient COVID-19 testing kits are the major factors that caused the spread of coronavirus cases. This study suggests that the short-, medium-, and long-term policies are required to mitigate the consequences of this pandemic and to revitalize the mountain economy of Gilgit-Baltistan, and in this regard, this study provides baseline information for policy-makers and practitioners to devise such demanding policies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Novel research opportunities: An unfortunate small silver lining to COVID-19 COVID-19 remains pandemic at the time of writing (September 2020) and it has opened up many avenues of research, on itself and on other aspects of medicine and science. This collection of Best Practice Guidelines (BPG) and the one following will review various aspects of COVID-19. Two papers review schools: reported clusters to date globally and the specific preparations made by one specific Maltese school to try to avoid/dampen any outbreaks in the school. Some economic aspects are also reviewed including the effects of the second wave on tourism revenues in Malta and a clarification of how (carefully) raising lockdowns is crucial to revive devastated economies. Three papers deal with statistics; estimating delay to death from surges of cases, demonstrating the second wave globally and by continent, and finally estimating the risk of rare and severe hypothetical adverse events after a vaccine has undergone standard testing and compares this to estimated death rate/s from COVID-19. The results of an influenza and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy questionnaire in Malta's healthcare workers are also depicted. One general review reiterates that COVID-19 is ageist, sexist, ruthless, dispassionate and opportunistic, and that protecting our vulnerable while easing restrictions remains crucial. Another review recaps the increased importance of less influenza vaccine hesitancy and less presenteeism among health care workers next winter.

COVID-19: Clouds Over the Antimicrobial Resistance Landscape In recent years, the increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been recognized as a real threat to human and animal health. It is a problem that has been given the highest priority, uniting nations in the fight against its causes and effects. Among the actions that have been implemented are: clinical and microbiological surveillance, promotion of rational and controlled use of antibiotics, AMR stewardship programs in hospitals, development of tools for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases to establish prompt and adequate treatment, and radically improving vaccination strategies. The current COVID-19 pandemic has placed disproportionate demands on the healthcare infrastructure and economy worldwide, which will negatively impact on the availability of materials as well as the technical capacity for diagnosis, patient care, and treatment of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Disruptions to production and distribution chains will hamper the availability and usage of antibiotics, also interrupting several of the activities that have been implemented thus far to combat AMR, including detailed laboratory monitoring and reinforced vaccination programs. Here, we discuss the main aspects that should be considered with regard to AMR, that may be affected by the pandemic and propose some actions to counter them. © 2020 IMSS Anti-bacterial agents; Antimicrobial stewardship; Coronavirus pandemic; Drug resistance; Microbial  COVID-19: A global and continental overview of the second wave and its (relatively) attenuated case fatality ratio Introduction: COVID-19 is pandemic. International travel bans in March 2020 dampened viral spread and resulted in an overnight global economic crisis. As countries ease travel and social distancing restrictions, viral resurgences are expected. This study was carried out in order to delineate the development of a second wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths due to lockdown easements in June–July 2020. Methods: Publically available data for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to September 2020 was obtained from “Our World In Data” website and analysed with Pearson correlation. Results: At global level, both datasets exhibited three distinct time periods. Cases rose to mid-April, plateaued till mid-May then rose again. Almost all of the slopes in these three time periods were statistically significant. Deaths followed a similar three-part pattern, albeit more pronounced, with values lagging circa one week after new cases and a middle time period when numbers (of deaths) actually decreased, with all periods exhibiting significant slopes. At continent level, for new cases, Asia rose steadily, Europe is increasing again, the Americas and Africa are declining. Deaths follow a similar pattern. Oceania shows a bimodal pattern, with a first and second wave of cases shortly followed by deaths in a similar pattern. The monthly ratio of detected cases to deaths (case fatality ratio) initially rose to 0.08, then fell to 0.02. Conclusion: The world is in its second wave of COVID-19, with fortunately reduced case fatality ratios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. Coronavirus; Economy; Governmental programs/economics; Pandemics; Population health; Population surveillance; Prevention  The Science Underlying COVID-19: Implications for the Cardiovascular System The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and economy worldwide on an unprecedented scale. Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S-spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor for internalization, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVID-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced angiotensin converting enzyme 2 downregulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heighten angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as elderly adults and those with cardiovascular risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis-like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multiorgan failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, in particular, in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as interleukin-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration, and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and thrombosis remain important. Specific evidence-based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated. To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Probably the COVID-19 contagion is the most adverse global public health, economic, social, and technological stress since the Second World War. It affects almost all countries and challenges the globalisation particularly the global supply chain. The research community struggles with the multidimensional consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. The critical goal is to quickly implement an efficient vaccine, as the society faces a tradeoff between death exposure and the size of the economic downturn. With this paper, we search for factors affecting contagion, mortality, and the time span between the country virus inception and first death. Additionally, we analyse the development of social media and financial markets. We applied a panel data set on all of the countries across the globe from 31 December 2019 until 31 March 2020 to investigate the patterns of epidemic development. We examined 7,642 country-daily data. We constructed classification tree regression, panel, and cross-sectional regression models. Our results support the conclusion that: 1) the speed of severity and contagion is different between themselves and across continents, 2) financial markets and social media respond differently to factors affecting contagion and severity, and 3) the time span between the first contagion in the economy and first death case cannot be plausibly explained with time-invariant variables. This research supports the policymakers with robust data for the informative allocation of scarce resources. © 2013 IEEE.

At that time, almost nobody paid any attention to it. The new pathogen, however, fast proved to be extremely infectious and dangerous, resulting in about 3-5% mortality. Over the few months that followed, coronavirus has spread over entire world. At the end of March, the total number of infections is fast approaching the psychological threshold of one million, resulting so far in tens of thousands of deaths. Due to the high number of lives already lost and the virus high potential for further spread, and due to its huge overall impact on the economies and societies, it is widely admitted that coronavirus poses the biggest challenge to the humanity after the second World war. The COVID-19 epidemic is provoking numerous questions at all levels. It also shows that modern society is extremely vulnerable and unprepared to such events. A wide scientific and public discussion becomes urgent. Some possible directions of this discussion are suggested in this article. © The authors. Published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

Lack of effective treatment, coupled with etiology of COVID-19, has resulted in more than 500,000 confirmed deaths at the time of writing, and the global economy is at an unseen unprecedented low level with unknown near-and long-term consequences. Ingavirin has been considered a non-toxic broad-spectrum antiviral with a complex mechanism of action. The molecule was originally designed for the prophylaxis and treatment of flu caused by both Influenza A and B viruses and for the treatment of viral causes of acute respiratory illness. The article hypothesized that the efficiency of given 1H-imidazol-4-yl heterocyclic scaffold-containing compound against SARS-CoV-2 might be connected with its ability to interfere with specific heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (A1, for example). These specific cellular RNA-binding proteins showed affinity to Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein, which shared high homology with the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the fact was expressed by a sequence identity of 90.52%. Impairing of the interactions between nuclear ribonucleoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might result in the inhibition of a viral replication cycle. Additional immunomodulating properties of ingavirin could be favorable for induction of adaptive immunity of host cells. © 2020, Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne. All rights reserved.

Weak medical infrastructure and over-reliance on medical aids may eventually predict worse outcomes in Africa. To reverse this trend, Africa must re-evaluate the only area with strategic advantage; phytotherapy. One of the many plants with previous antiviral potency is against RNA viruses is Aframomum melegueta. In this study, one hundred (100) A. melegueta secondary metabolites have been mined and computational evaluated for inhibition of host furin, and SARS-COV-2 targets including 3C-like proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro), 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase (nsp16) and surface glycoprotein/ACE2 receptor interface. Silica-gel column partitioning of A. melegueta fruit/seed resulted in 6 fractions tested against furin activity. Diarylheptanoid (Letestuianin A), phenylpropanoid (4-Cinnamoyl-3-hydroxy-spiro[furan-5,2′-(1′H)-indene]-1′,2,3′(2′H,5H)-trione), flavonoids (Quercetin, Apigenin and Tectochrysin) have been identified as high-binding compounds to SARS-COV-2 targets in a polypharmacology manner. Di-ethyl-ether (IC50 = 0.03 mg/L), acetone (IC50 = 1.564 mg/L), ethyl-acetate (IC50 = 0.382 mg/L) and methanol (IC50 = 0.438 mg/L) fractions demonstrated the best inhibition in kinetic assay while DEF, ASF and MEF completely inhibited furin-recognition sequence containing Ebola virus-pre-glycoprotein. In conclusion, A. melegueta and its secondary metabolites have potential for addressing the therapeutic needs of African population during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Aframomum melegueta; COVID-19; Diarylheptanoid; flavonoids; phenylpropanoid; SARS-COV-2  Identification of potential anti-TMPRSS2 natural products through homology modelling, virtual screening and molecular dynamics simulation studies Recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a pandemic of COVID-19. The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual screening of Selleckchem database was performed through ‘Virtual Work Flow’ (VSW) to find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential for application in COVID-19.

Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2′-O position of the viral nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free energy of–12.83 ± 0.52 kcal/mol. The second best inhibitor, Galuteolin is a natural compound that inhibits tyrosinase enzyme with MM-PBSA binding free energy value of −11.21 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. Detailed ligand and protein interactions were analyzed and common residues across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV were identified. We propose Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and Galuteolin as the potential inhibitors of NSP16. The results in this study can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 and can also form the basis of rational drug design against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. coronavirus; COVID-19; docking; drug repurposing; MD simulation; virtual screening  “A Plague upon Your Howling”: art and culture in the viral emergency In this introduction, we outline the context for the international emergence of cultural policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our article first offers a general account of how arts and culture have been affected by the pandemic, before looking at some of the state interventions (bailouts’) to support the professional sector, and the present and future conditions they might be seeking to preserve or occasion. We then examine the UK as a particular case study. In rejecting a politics of “bailout” and “return”, and in synchrony with others seeking to situate culture in a re-vitalised political economy, we argue that professional arts and culture needs to move forward with a “new deal” in hand; one that can enhance culture’s potential and multipart value, as well as help the sector progressively engage with the many social, economic and environmental challenges ahead and beyond C-19. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The viruses have adapted to infect a large number of animal species, ranging from bats to camels. At present, seven CoVs infect humans, of which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe. Healthcare systems around the globe have been stretched beyond their limits posing new challenges to emergency healthcare services and critical care. The outbreak continues to jeopardize human health, social life and economy. All known human CoVs have zoonotic origins. Recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pet, zoo and certain farm animals has highlighted its potential for reverse zoonosis. This scenario is particularly alarming, since these animals could be potential reservoirs for secondary zoonotic infections. In this article, we highlight interspecies SARS-CoV-2 infections and focus on the reverse zoonotic potential of this virus. We also emphasize the importance of potential secondary zoonotic events and the One-Health and One-World approach to tackle such future pandemics. © 2020 The Author(s).

A Dsge Modeling In Small Open Economy This article aims to investigate the relationship between inbound tourism and housing market along with the recent boom in Icelandic real estate sector, in which both house and rental prices have been rising dramatically. To this end, we construct a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model enclosing a tourism sector and a housing market with owner-occupied and rental sections. The simulation results unveil a transmission channel that indicates the higher inbound tourism demand raises both house prices and rental prices. Variance decomposition and historical decomposition show that both inbound tourism demand shock and manufacturing technology shock are the key driving forces of the fluctuations of Icelandic house prices, consumption, and investment, whereas housing preference shock plays the most important role in determining the volatility of rental prices. The policy implications indicate that any shocks to tourism could easily spillover to housing market dynamics and aggregate fluctuations. © The Author(s) 2020.

However, these measures are not without cost to the health and economies of the nations in which they are enacted. Nations are now looking for methods to remove physical distancing measures and return to full functioning. To prevent a massive second wave of infections, this must be done with a data-driven methodology. The purpose of this article is to propose an algorithm for coronavirus testing which would allow for physical distancing to be scaled back in a step-wise manner which limits ensuing infections and protects the capacity of the healthcare system.

Efforts towards a COVID-19 vaccine To many scientists and political authorities, the development of a vaccine against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be the way to restore normality to civil life in this time of a devastating pandemic. Expectations for a vaccine are high while the case numbers continue to rise. As of mid-August 2020, more than 20 million people have been infected and more than 760 000 lives have been lost worldwide. The threat of this virus to health, the economy and to society is so great that the wish for a fast track vaccine is understandable, but how realistic is it? This survey article tries to give an overview of vaccine candidates in development, including preclinical and clinical testing, and it mentions some of the societal problems of vaccine acceptance. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Operating room efficiency and timing during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in a referral orthopaedic hospital in Northern Italy Purpose: The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affected health care systems at different levels with important consequences on health, economy, and social structures. This paper aims to analyse the impact on surgical block utilisation and efficiency in an orthopaedics reference centre in Northern Italy. Methods: The timeframe chosen for the current analysis was April 2020, to be compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Number and type of procedures, first case delay, occupancy rate, and turnover time were used as indicators to benchmark the activities. Results: The overall number of surgical procedures decreased by 57%, from 537 in 2019 to 230 in the same timeframe in 2020. Orthopaedic procedures predominated in 2019, with 434 cases (80.8%), while in 2020, trauma was the leading activity, with 200 cases (86.9%). Orthopaedic surgery had a relative decrement of 93% while trauma has relatively increased by 94%. Mean first case delay in orthopaedic room (OR) was two hours and 36 minutes (SD 01:40:21) in 2020 compared with only 19 minutes (SD 00:02:15) in 2019. OR occupancy rate was 59% in 2020 compared with 89% in 2019. Turnover time raised from 21 minutes in 2019 to 53 min in 2020. Conclusions: These data clearly show the deep impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OR facilities. Efficiency indicators fell dramatically in April 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019. This scenario will deeply affect both the waiting lists and the economic burden of the hospital. Regaining efficiency and maintaining the quality and safety of the process while restoring elective orthopaedic surgery are among the main challenges that surgeons will face in the next time. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.

To establish the various effects of the coronavirus on the economy and protective equipment, as well as probable transmission channels. Methods. Mathematical, empirical, systemic, analytical, economic and other approaches are used to study the development of the world market in the conditions of the coronavirus disease. Results. We give a brief description of the Kermack–Mac-Kendrick epidemic model, corresponding to the general nature of the current coronavirus epidemic, that can dramatically change the global market development scenario. We show three scenarios for the global economy development. Quick recovery implies a slowdown in economic growth in the United States and Europe will end by the end of March; China is likely to recover by the end of April, and demand will recover relatively quickly. Global slowdown implies the economy will recover at the end of the second quarter, but global GDP growth in 2020 will drop to 1…1.5 percent. Global pandemic implies a serious shock to the global economy, which can last for almost a year. Conclusion. Three scenarios of the world economy development in the context of the coronavirus crisis are formulated, as well as the various effects of the coronavirus disease on the world economy are identified; remedies are proposed. We concluded that the coronavirus disease will affect microeconomic heritage, macroeconomic heritage and political heritage. Multilaterally, the crisis can be interpreted as a call for increased cooperation or, on the contrary, a need to expand the bipolar centers of geopolitical power. We list a number of mathematical papers with extensive bibliography on COVID-19. On the example of one of such works we have shown that the Kermack–Mac-Kendrick model remains the backbone of the research in this sphere. © 2020, Saratov State University. All rights reserved.

These applications could satisfy the diverse needs in the ecosystem of agricultural products, e.g., increasing transparency of food safety and IoT based food quality control, provenance traceability, improvement of contract exchanges, and transactions efficiency. As multiple untrusted parties, including small-scale farmers, food processors, logistic companies, distributors and retailers, are involved into the complex farm-to-fork pipeline, it becomes vital to achieve optimal trade-off between efficiency and integrity of the agricultural management systems as required in contexts. In this paper, we provide a survey to study both techniques and applications of blockchain technology used in the agricultural sector. First, the technical elements, including data structure, cryptographic methods, and consensus mechanisms are explained in detail. Secondly, the existing agricultural blockchain applications are categorized and reviewed to demonstrate the use of the blockchain techniques. In addition, the popular platforms and smart contract are provided to show how practitioners use them to develop these agricultural applications. Thirdly, we identify the key challenges in many prospective agricultural systems, and discuss the efforts and potential solutions to tackle these problems. Further, we conduct an improved food supply chain in the post COVID-19 pandemic economy as an illustration to demonstrate an effective use of blockchain technology. © 2013 IEEE. agricultural applications; Blockchain technology; data integrity; food supply chains management; traceability Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Food safety; Food supply; Supply chains; Agricultural management systems; Agricultural sector; Agricultural system; Cryptographic methods; Food processors; Food quality controls; Popular platform; Small scale farmers; Blockchain Mass Events Trigger Malta's Second Peak After Initial Successful Pandemic Suppression The second COVID-19 wave is sweeping the globe as restrictions are lifted. Malta, the ‘poster child of Europe’s COVID-19 first wave success’ also fell victim shortly after it welcomed the first tourists on 1st of July 2020. Only four positive cases were reported over the successive 15 days. Stability was disrupted when two major mass events were organized despite various health professional warnings. In a matter of few just days, daily cases rose to two-digit figures, with high community transmission, a drastic rise in active cases, and a rate per hundred thousand in Europe second only to Spain. Frontliners were swamped with swabbing requests while trying to sustain robust case management, contact tracing and follow-up. Indeed, the number of hospitalizations and the need for intensive ventilation increased. Despite the initial cases were among young adults, within weeks a small spill off on the more elderly population was observed. Restrictions were re-introduced including mandatory mask wearing in specific locations and capping of the total number of people in a single gathering. Malta is an island and the potential for containment would have been relatively simple and effective and permitting mass gatherings was unwise. Protecting the health of the population should take centre stage while carrying out extensive testing, contact tracing and surveillance. Containment and mitigation along with public cooperation is the key to curbing resurgences especially with the influenza season around the corner. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Are global value chains (GVCs) truly global or are they more of a regional phenomenon? We provide a new perspective on this issue using network analysis based on the measure of trade in value added. We first show that GVC activities can be consistently identified and grouped into three types of networks, i.e. traditional, simple, and complex trade networks, according to the number of times that factor contents cross national borders in global production sharing. Further investigation on the changes in topology and structure of various networks reveals that, GVCs are more likely organized regionally and dominated by large countries, like the US, China, and Germany. However, at the sector level, what GVCs look like largely depends on the perspective (supply or demand) and the type of networks adopted. This can help better understand the possible structural change of GVCs brought by the US–China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020, © 2020 The International Input--Output Association.

The e-scooter represents one of several innovative modes that have emerged to cater for transportation needs in urban areas. They provide connectivity linking local origins and destinations, as well as interconnectivity linking urban locations to inter-urban networks. These vehicles are marketed as a micro form of public transportation designed to meet the needs of fit and able people wishing to make trips of two miles or less. They are touted as part of “micromobility” complementing existing transportation networks. This paper reviews the gray and limited academic economic literature looking at the viability and economics of e-scooters within the context of the regulatory environment in which they operate in US cities. It considers the ways regulatory structures are evolving as the authorities learn of the attributes and limitations of the mode. In doing this, the paper also makes comparisons with some of the other “novel” forms of local transportation that have emerged, including those offered by transportation network companies. The paper focuses on the pre-Covid-19 period. © 2020 Disruptive innovations; E-scooters; Economic core; Economic regulation; Gig-economy; Nudging; Sharing economy; Technical externalities  The suicidal state: In advance of an American requiem Written in late March 2020 in the early days of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, this essay represents a contingent reflection on the American pandemic response, mourning in anticipation of what would soon surely unfold. I argue that the State's long-standing sacrificial economies have in this moment culminated in a suicidal State. The term is Foucault's, appearing in a controversial lecture on biopolitics, Nazism, and ""biological racism."" Despite Foucault's problematic treatment of rac-ism, I suggest that some aspects of this discourse might nevertheless be apropos in our context. The U.S. pandemic response is racism's suicidal State legacy writ large: An extension and retooling of historically racist infrastructures deployed (once again, again) in racialized domains (as more recent reports evidence), but in this moment also across biosocial inequities and vulnerabilities marked by differential fungibilities other than race. © 2020 Penn State University Press.

Various definitions of the concept of national competitiveness are presented as well as directions in which the state affects national competitiveness. Among the latter, state procurements of goods and services and their varieties are considered. Special importance of the indirect influence of the state on the country’s competitiveness in the form of creating favorable investment climate, pursuing structural policy, and establishing clear rules for doing business is emphasized. The analysis of the possibilities and methods of state regulation of business activities based on a number of indicators of international organizations is presented. The use of new opportunities by the state in the context of digitalization of the economy to ensure competitiveness is highlighted. The role of the state and PPP in the development of infrastructure, which serves as a guarantor and stimulator of national competitiveness, is examined. The conclusion is made that the role of the state in national competitiveness is increasing, especially under the spread of COVID-19. © 2020, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

Although less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, it has taken several lives and taken down the economies of many coun-tries. Before this outbreak, the most recent coronavi-rus outbreaks were the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV outbreaks that happened in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Since, the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, they share several similarities. So, this review aims at un-derstanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses. Studies re-veal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses. The presence of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the S protein priming and might increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other beta coronaviruses. So, furin inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche. All rights reserved.

Here, we illustrate why it is important, from a wellbeing perspective, to recognise such trade-offs, and provide a framework, based on the economic concept of 'marginal analysis', for doing so. We illustrate its potential through consideration of optimising the balance between reducing the reproductive rate (R) of the virus and further opening of the economy. The framework accommodates both perspectives in the health-vs-economy debate whereby, depending on where we are within the marginal analysis framework, either health issues are allowed to dominate or, below some threshold of R and/or background level of infection, health and economic considerations can be traded off against each other. Given the inevitability of such trade-offs, the framework exposes crucial questions to be addressed, such as: the critical value of R and/or background infection, above which health considerations predominate, and which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; and the value of lives forgone resulting from the small increases in R and/or background infection levels that may have to be tolerated as the economy is gradually opened. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Rethinking international subsidy rules Geo-economic tensions, notably associated with the rise of China, and global collective action problems—climate change and the COVID-19pandemic—call for international cooperation to revise and develop rules to guide both the use of domestic subsidies and responses by governments to cross-border competition spillover effects. Current WTO rules dividing all subsidies into prohibited or actionable categories are no longer fit for purpose. Piecemeal efforts in preferential trade agreements and bi- or trilateral configurations offer a basis on which to build but are too narrow in scope. Addressing spillover effects of subsidies could start with G20 countries launching a work programme to mobilise an epistemic community concerned with subsidy policies, tasked with building a more solid evidence base on the magnitude, purpose and effects of subsidy policies. The need for such cooperation has become even more pressing by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated increase in the use of subsidy programmes in major economies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd G20; international cooperation; spillovers; Subsidy policies; WTO  Assessing the interstitial rent: The effects of touristification on the historic center of naples (italy) The paper explains a research methodology to understand the impacts of touristification and overtourism on the urban dimension. A block of the Naples historic downtown (Italy) has been selected as a sample to verify the transformations induced by the airification process of the city since 2015 on the social and urban environment, investigating the influence on real estate dynamics, and their impacts related to economic, social, cultural and urban criteria. The mapping of Airbnb listings on the block has allowed to analyse the economic convenience of renting short-term housing, identifying an income surplus defined as “interstitial rent”, which represents the economic advantage achieved. The analyses carried out on the average market values of the properties on Airbnb have revealed the tendency to redevelop the “waste building stock”, which is unattractive for the ordinary market, in view of its turbo-valorisation by converting it into accommodation. The attractiveness characteristics of the properties were compared to the average market values to investigate the housing stock that can be removed from the ordinary residence market in view of its value enhancement. This research has highlighted the progressive gentrification of the historic center and the relocation of the permanent inhabitants outside it. Therefore, investigating the prevailing sentiment that agitates the social organisations of Europe, we have come to provide an intervention proposal for the regulation of post covid-19 housing policy, which tends to co-participated formulation of strategic choices, involving all interested parties, in order to find a shared application. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

As on May 10, 2020, more than 4,153,300 people stand infected from the virus due to an unprecedented rate of transmission and 282,700 have lost their lives because of the disease. In this context, medicinal plants may provide a way to treat the disease by targeting specific essential proteins of the virus. We screened about 51 medicinal plants and found that Tea (Camellia sinensis) and Haritaki (Terminalia chebula) has potential against SARS-COV-2 3CLpro, with an IC50 for Green Tea as 8.9 ± 0.5 μg/ml and Haritaki 8.8 ± 0.5 μg/ml. The in-silico studies suggested that Tea component Thearubigins binds to the cysteine 145 of protease active site and could be a pharmacoactive molecule. We predict that the inhibition in protease activity may be able to halt the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and therefore, we propose Green Tea, Black Tea, and Haritaki plant extracts as potential therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation on role of bioactive constituents of extracts is needed to establish the molecular basis of inhibition and towards expedited drug discovery. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 3CLpro; Haritaki; medicinal plants; SARS-CoV-2; tea  The Final Frontier: China, Taiwan, and the United States in Strategic Competition for Central America China’s rise as a global power corresponded with a diminution of Taiwanese diplomacy, which has left Central America as the last region to host a continuous bloc of countries that recognize the ROC. In this article, we argue that China’s success in gaining diplomatic recognition from Taiwan’s former allies has largely resulted from China's economic policy, specifically its promises of large-scale infrastructure projects and the integration of Central American economies with Chinese markets. However, there are limits to how far China has advanced in gaining full recognition from the region. The competing political and economic interests of China, Taiwan, the United States, and the Central American countries themselves, continue to influence patterns of diplomatic switching. More specifically, we argue that the threat of punitive measures from the United States combined with a turn in Taiwanese diplomacy toward assistance efforts to combat Covid-19 may deter future switching in the short to medium-term. Our analysis offers case studies of four Central American countries (Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador and Nicaragua) to illustrate the multi-year processes by which China’s economic strategy leads to diplomatic switching and examine the paths ahead for the remaining holdouts facing the prospect of economic and political penalties by the United States. © 2020, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.

Such mobilities, however, cause disruptive social, spatial and economic transformations of urban and rural landscapes across the globe. Consequently, transnational gentrifications may be considered a crucial testimonial of economic shifts, during the 2008–2020 period of accumulation. In this article, we argue that the underlying conceptual assumptions of transnational gentrifications require crucial adjustments. We should especially consider the intellectual roots that simply celebrate leisure-oriented mobilities while setting aside the exclusionary social practices of the consumption of space, culture, heritage and place. We do this by interpreting the phenomenon by means of a political economy that understands (i) the lens of the multi-scalar organisation of state power as a centrepiece for orchestrating the conditions for transnational gentrifications; (ii) transnational middle-class leisure-oriented mobilities linked dichotomously with labour precariousness and flexibility; and (iii) the rent gap as an analytical tool to understand dispossession, and corresponding displacement of people, practices and discourses. This approach sheds light on the nuances of gentrification as an attribute of systemic violence exercised in financialised capitalism. It also supports us to sketch out a theoretically informed outlook for the ongoing reorientation of intertwined gentrifications by transnational capital investments with intermittent flows of people in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020. displacement/gentrification; employment/labour; history/heritage/memory; housing; social justice  The cultural change of the perception of elderliness during coronavirus outbreak [Yaşlilik algisinin koronavirüs salgini sürecindeki kültürel değişimi] The existence of global problems in the world and the increase in the speed of these problems in com-parison to centuries cause fluctuations in the world population. While the events directly affecting the world population are concentrated on certain masses, the perception of the society is also affected in this direction and creates cultural changes. One of these global problems is Covid-19 pandemic, which began to spread from Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. WHO declared covid-19 caused by corona virus as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. It spreads rapidly through the respiratory tract and is declared to result in death, especially in patients with chronic diseases and the elderly. It is supported by cultural codes that pandemic is a respiratory disease that increases the risk of death of the elderly population and follows different policies around treatment, care, prevention and protection according to the development level of the countries. Being under direct risk, the elderly population over the age of 65 and those with chronic illnesses in Turkey faced curfew on March 22 and protection approaches are intended to be taken for the elderly population. It is predicted that the risk of transmission will increase compared to the density of the elderly population and measures have been taken accord-ingly. It should be emphasized that the epidemic process and the measures taken affect the aging culture, and cultural changes should be determined by taking into consideration the rate of increase in the population. In this way, revealing the value gains and losses of the elderly in the society and the change experienced by the culture of the aging through the epidemic process will be evaluated in terms of folklore. When the policies of the state are analyzed, the viewpoint of the society towards the elderly and the vital value of the elderly can change. For this reason, it is necessary to reveal the difference between the policies pursued by the state from the policies followed in other world states and to determine the culture-based approaches. Policies on health, economy, socialization, physical isolation, social support and the protection and preventive measures implemented in this context have enabled the change of the culture of elderliness and the change in the society’s perception of elderly in remembering, longing, belonging, fear and anxiety arising from the loss of their value attract attention. How the elderly perceive the epidemic, how they reflect their feelings and perceptions on social media, and their attitude towards the reactions have been directly influential in the regaining of their social roles. The obligatory contact of the elderly group with technology took place in this period and acquiring the right information through the media has gained importance in terms of ease of access to information. Since the prevention of socialization with the curfew only covers the physical distance, communication with people continued remotely through technology, neighbors, friends, balconies, building spaces, etc. and it is thought that communication has been used more intensively with the change of size. When those who comply with the decisions implemented by the state within the scope of health measures and those who do not comply are evaluated, it can be concluded that the perception of aging in the society gains value. It can be said that the approach established by the state on protection and trust is based on respect and love for the elderly in culture. With being a risk group, following precautions, using warnings that appeal to emotions and using appropriate language, the state has modeled the behavior of the elderly with the methods it has followed and it is understood that social memory is an example in recalling cultural codes. © 2020, Milli Folklor Dergisi.

"4","1","Redesigning Supply Chains using Blockchain-Enabled Circular Economy and COVID-19 Experiences The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed businesses and societies to the shortfalls of normal patterns of production, consumption, and their long-lasting impact on supply chains. In this opinion paper, we provide insights from the COVID-19 pandemic for making supply chains more resilient, transparent, and sustainable. These insights include supply chains needing to develop localization, agility, and digitization (LAD) characteristics. We link LAD to a potential solution using blockchain technology and circular economy principle capabilities. Use cases are used to show how blockchain-enabled circular economy practices can support supply chain LAD efforts. Supply chain tracking, tracing, and responsiveness can be supported through blockchain-enabled circular economy practices. One result of identifying these relationships include solutions and insights at multiple levels and stakeholders – individual, organizational, supply chain, governmental, and community. These crisis-related observations and findings set a future research foundation for sustainable production and consumption. © 2020 Agility; Blockchain technology; Circular economy; COVID-19; Digitization; Localization; Supply chain sustainability  Urban flooding events pose risks of virus spread during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic Since the first report in December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to most parts of the world, with over 21.5 million people infected and nearly 768,000 deaths to date. Evidence suggests that transmission of the virus is primarily through respiratory droplets and contact routes, and airborne carriers such as atmospheric particulates and aerosols have also been proposed as important vectors for the environmental transmission of COVID-19. Sewage and human excreta have long been recognized as potential routes for transmitting human pathogens. The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been detected in human feces and urine, where it could remain viable for days and show infectivity. Urban flooding, a common threat in summer caused by heavy rainfalls, is frequently reported in urban communities along with sewage overflows. With summer already underway and economy re-opening in many parts of the world, urban flooding and the often-accompanied sewage overflows could jeopardize previous mitigation efforts by posing renewed risks of virus spread in affected areas and communities. In this article, we present the up-to-date evidence and discussions on sewage-associated transmission of COVID-19, and highlighted the roles of sewage overflow and sewage-contaminated aerosols in two publicized events of community outbreaks. Further, we collected evidence in real-life environments to demonstrate the shortcuts of exposure to overflowed sewage and non-dispersed human excreta during a local urban flooding event. Given that communities serviced by combined sewer systems are particularly prone to such risks, local municipalities could prioritize wastewater infrastructure upgrades and consider combined sewer separations to minimize the risks of pathogen transmission via sewage overflows during epidemics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, such predictions will likely be aggravated by the excessive use and consumption of single-use plastics (including personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves) due to COVID-19 pandemic. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview on the effects of COVID-19 on macroplastic pollution and its potential implications on the environment and human health considering short- and long-term scenarios; addressing the main challenges and discussing potential strategies to overcome them. It emphasises that future measures, involved in an emergent health crisis or not, should reflect a balance between public health and environmental safety as they are both undoubtedly connected. Although the use and consumption of plastics significantly improved our quality of life, it is crucial to shift towards sustainable alternatives, such as bio-based plastics. Plastics should remain in the top of the political agenda in Europe and across the world, not only to minimise plastic leakage and pollution, but to promote sustainable growth and to stimulate both green and blue- economies. Discussions on this topic, particularly considering the excessive use of plastic, should start soon with the involvement of the scientific community, plastic producers and politicians in order to be prepared for the near future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fashion rental businesses need to strategically respond to consumers with heightened contamination concerns. This research aims to understand how diverse consumption values of fashion rental service form attitudes towards the service depending on one's contamination concerns and predict adoption intentions. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data (N = 270). The findings suggest that functional, economic, and emotional values significantly increase attitudes leading to adoption intentions. Further, contamination concerns moderate the relationships between values and attitudes as well as attitudes and intentions. The findings enrich the literature of collaborative consumption by integrating theories of consumption value and consumer contamination. Furthermore, the results provide managerial implications for strategic communication of FRS to effectively reach consumers depending on their contamination concern. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The Chinese term for this health services value is jing hua xin ling, psychological destressing. Here we present the first case where optimal tourist infrastructure is influenced by including mental health. Using a multi-stage, cross-lingual, differential stakeholder method, we analyse conflicts between road- and roadless-access tourism in the very large new Sanjiangyuan National Park, Qinghai, which offers jing hua xin ling to domestic tourists from eastern-seaboard cities. This provides a powerful tourism attraction, and hence economic opportunity, for the region around the park. If these mental health aspects are included, together with their direct and indirect consequences for tourism, then roadlessness is preferable to new roads. Similar infrastructure conflicts occur for park tourism worldwide, and jing hua xin ling can provide a global theoretical framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Adventure; COVID-19; Culture; Health; Protected area expenditure; global economy; health services; infrastructure; mental health; national park; tourism economics; tourist attraction; China; Qinghai; Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve SARS-CoV-2 in environmental perspective: Occurrence, persistence, surveillance, inactivation and challenges The unprecedented global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is depicting the distressing pandemic consequence on human health, economy as well as ecosystem services. So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (βCoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The surge mitigation is complicated and associates many factors, including the pandemic status, policy, socioeconomics and resident behaviours. Modelling and analytics with spatial-temporal big urban data are required to assist the mitigation of the pandemic. This study proposes a novel perspective to analyse the spatial-temporal potential exposure risk of residents by capturing human behaviours based on spatial-temporal car park availability data. Near real-time data from 1,904 residential car parks in Singapore, a classical megacity, are collected to analyse car mobility and its spatial-temporal heat map. The implementation of the circuit breaker, a COVID-19 measure, in Singapore has reduced the mobility and heat (daily frequency of mobility) significantly at about 30.0%. It contributes to a 44.3%–55.4% reduction in the transportation-related air emissions under two scenarios of travelling distance reductions. Urban sustainability impacts in both environment and economy are discussed. The spatial-temporal potential exposure risk mapping with space-time interactions is further investigated via an extended Bayesian spatial-temporal regression model. The maximal reduction rate of the defined potential exposure risk lowers to 37.6% by comparison with its peak value. The big data analytics of changes in car mobility behaviour and the resultant potential exposure risks can provide insights to assist in (a) designing a flexible circuit breaker exit strategy, (b) precise management via identifying and tracing hotspots on the mobility heat map, and (c) making timely decisions by fitting curves dynamically in different phases of COVID-19 mitigation. The proposed method has the potential to be used by decision-makers worldwide with available data to make flexible regulations and planning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Air-emission reduction; Car mobility behaviour; COVID-19; Flexible lockdown strategy; Risk mitigation; Spatial-temporal analysis Advanced Analytics; Behavioral research; Curve fitting; Data Analytics; Decision making; Electric circuit breakers; Flexible electronics; Garages (parking); Regression analysis; Flexible circuit; Human behaviours; Near real-time datum; Potential exposure; Regression model; Space-time interactions; Spatial temporals; Urban sustainability; Sustainable development The moral and political economy of the pandemic in Bangladesh: Weak states and strong societies during Covid-19 As the Covid-19 pandemic spread in 2020, the government of Bangladesh ordered a lockdown and promised a program of relief. Citizens complied at first, but soon returned to economic and social life; relief proved slow and uncertain, and citizens could not rely on government assistance. The government tacitly and then officially permitted the lockdown to end, despite a rising Covid-19 caseload. This article draws on theories about state capacity to make and enforce policy to understand why Bangladesh proved unable to sustain a lockdown deemed necessary to contain the pandemic in this densely populated, low income country. Drawing on original qualitative mobile phone-based research in six selected communities, this article examines how the state exercised its capacities for coercion, control over lower factions within political society, and sought to preserve and enhance its legitimacy. It concludes that despite a) the growth in the capacity of the Bangladeshi state in the past decade and b) strong political incentives to manage the pandemic without harm to economic wellbeing, the pressures to sustain legitimacy with the masses forced the state and its frontline actors to tolerate lockdown rule-breaking, conceding that the immediate livelihood needs of the poor masses overrode national public health concerns. Chronically unable to enforce its authority over local political elites, the state failed to ensure a fair and timely distribution of relief. The weakness of the Bangladeshi state contrasts with the strength of widely shared ‘moral economy’ views within society, which provided powerful ethical and political justification for citizens’ failures to comply with the lockdown, and for officials’ forbearance in its enforcement. The Covid-19 pandemic highlights both the importance of state capacity in managing novel shocks from within the global system, and the challenges in settings where weak states are embedded in strong societies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Bangladesh; Covid-19; Moral economy; Social protection; State capacity COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; political economy; public health; respiratory disease; state; viral disease; Bangladesh A critical review of the impacts of COVID-19 on the global economy and ecosystems and opportunities for circular economy strategies The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, but the world is still reeling from its aftermath. Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus. These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Issues such as recession phase in which the economy will find itself, the increase in GIG economy and entire societies are discussed in the article. The article explores the problems associated with the onset of the economic crisis and the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in countries with small open economies (SOE). It was proved that the key challenges the small open economies countries will face are primarily the devaluation of the national currency, the massive closure of small and micro businesses, the growth of social problems, etc. The review of the literature, as well as reports from financial institutions, show that the economies of individual countries are entering a phase of stagnation and recession. In the coming years, the economy will be affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancing will change nature of employment and working places will shift to GIG-economy. Exactly these factors will expectedly provoke the growth of socio-economic crises in the country. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Impact analysis of COVID-19 on ship recycling using Weibull tonnage estimation and scenario analysis method The sustainability of the ship recycling industry strongly linked with the global shipping market and international commodity flows. More than 80% of the End of Life (EoL) ships are dismantled in South Asian countries, namely Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Due to measures taken to minimize the propagation of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an international supply chain is broken to a historic low, except for certain medical-related urgencies. Due to the disruption of global supply chains, the industry may submerge into uncertainty due to, perhaps, lack of adequate labor force to dismantle increased EoL ships and due to disturbances of vessel transportation to the recycling nations amid strong precautionary measures. Our estimate suggests that about 300 million Gross Tonnage (GT) available for demolition in the next five years and the inability to get them recycled would cost about 20 billion dollars. More importantly, South Asian recycling nations would suffer from economic losses and employment opportunities. In this study, we also apply a scenario analysis technique to understand the impact range of COVID-19 in the short term and in the long term. The disruption is viewed through a circular economy framework, identifying a critical lack of ‘global scale’ acknowledgment in the circular economy framework. This article suggests that a formalized global scale, paralleled with favorable policies, may reduce supply chain disruption and improve sustainable development in the receiving nations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. circular economy; COVID-19; disruption response; global circular economy; scenario analysis; ship recycling Losses; Ships; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Employment opportunities; Global supply chain; International supply chains; Precautionary measures; Scenario analysis; Scenario analysis techniques; Supply-chain disruptions; Recycling; COVID-19; environmental economics; estimation method; recycling; regional economy; respiratory disease; scenario analysis; vessel; viral disease; Weibull theory; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; economic recession; lifespan; mathematical model; recycling; socioeconomics; Bangladesh; India; Pakistan; Coronavirus Modeling the spread of COVID-19 on construction workers: An agent-based approach As the spread of COVID-19 has continued since December 2019, stay at home orders around the globe have changed how we live our lives, mostly from physical to virtual interactions, such as going to college and doing our jobs; however, some activities are basically impossible to perform virtually, such as construction activities. Thus, the construction sector has been highly disrupted by the current pandemic. The construction sector represents a key component of countries’ economies—it is approximately 13% of global GDP—as such, having the availability to perform construction activities with a minimum spread of COVID-19 may help to the financial response to the pandemic. Given this context, this study aims to understand the potential impact of COVID-19 on construction workers using an agent-based modeling approach. Activities are classified as being of low-medium–high risk for workers, and the spread of COVID-19 is simulated among construction workers in a project. This study found that the workforce from a construction project may be reduced by 30% to 90% due to the spread of COVID-19. Understanding how COVID-19 may spread among construction workers may assist construction project managers in creating adequate conditions for workers to perform their job, minimizing the chances of getting infected with COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Agent-based modeling; Construction; COVID-19 Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Construction industry; Human resource management; Agent-based approach; Construction activities; Construction project managers; Construction projects; Construction sectors; Construction workers; Potential impacts; Virtual interactions; Project management Whatever it takes? The global financial safety net, Covid-19, and developing countries Multilateral financial institutions have pledged to do whatever it takes to enable emerging market and developing countries to fill a $2.5 trillion financing gap to combat Covid-19 and subsequent economic crises. In this article, we present new datasets to track the extent to which multilateral financial institutions are meeting these goals, and conduct a preliminary assessment of progress to date. We find that the International Monetary Fund and the principal regional financial arrangements have made relatively trivial amounts of new financing available and have been slow to disburse the financing at their disposal. As of July 31, 2020, these institutions had committed $89.56 billion in loans and $550 million in currency swaps, totaling $90.11 billion—just 12.6% of their current capacity. The new datasets allow scholars, policymakers, and civil society to continue to track these trends, and eventually examine the impact of such financing on health and development outcomes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Covid-19; Global economic governance; Global financial safety net; International Monetary Fund; Regional financial arrangements COVID-19; data set; developing world; finance; global economy; governance approach; IMF; regional economy Business analysis in the times of COVID-19: Empirical testing of the contemporary academic findings The pandemic of the coronavirus known as 'COVID-19' has spread rapidly across the globe, resulting in a worldwide economic recession. Although global efforts are in place to combat the virus, it continues to spread on a massive scale. This is not just a medical crisis; rather, it is a business crisis as well. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a research scale that could be used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on business. We adopted a scale variables approach that is generated from topics covered in the papers of leading academic business journals to form the basis of our analysis. We exposed the scale to qualitative and quantitative testing and concluded that it is reliable for research on the negative effects of COVID-19 on enterprises. The scale was used to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 on businesses in two countries, namely Serbia and Kuwait, to represent two different continents. The results of this research indicate that the influence of this coronavirus is equally devastating in both countries, Kuwait with its otherwise good economic conditions and Serbia with relatively poor ones. The findings of the research are beneficial for both academics in producing quality output papers, as well as their support to managers in various business industries in their fight against coronavirus to keep their businesses sustainable. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada Business; COVID-19; Economy; Interruptions; Kuwait; Serbia  The impact of COVID 19 on air pollution levels and other environmental indicators - A case study of Egypt The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only affected health and economics, but also its effect extended to include other aspects, such as the environment. Using Egypt as a case study, this paper presents the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on air pollution levels by studying nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate matter represented in absorbing aerosol index (AAI), carbon monoxide (CO), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country's economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015–2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic. Therefore, stricter laws must be enacted to protect the environment in Egypt. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Absorbing aerosol index; Carbon monoxide and ozone; COVID-19; Environmental impacts in Egypt; Medical and municipal solid wastes; Nitrogen dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; disease prevalence; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; groundwater pollution; nitrogen dioxide; recycling; satellite data; solid waste; viral disease; Alexandria [Egypt]; Cairo [Egypt]; Egypt; Coronavirus The Role of Internet of Things (IoT) in the Containment and Spread of the Novel COVID-19 Pandemic The novel COVID-19 pandemic is hitting the strongest economies in an unprecedented manner leading to the crippling of most economic sectors globally. Movement restriction order profoundly affected many industries, including manufacturing, transportation, aviation, education, tourism, and trade and investment, among others. The consequences resulted in people losing their jobs, corporate organizations and the Government experiencing a sharp drop in income and revenue. Similarly, the global crude oil market prices crash to the lowest rate of less than USD30/barrel. In recent times, the world has not witnessed a pandemic that threatened human existence without any sigh of relief as no cure has been found for the disease. The most effective recommended measure in containing the chain of transmitting the virus is through social distancing as a large gathering of people is highly discouraged. Internet of Things (IoT) alongside other related technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), drones, robotics, Big Data, and e-learning related technologies were found as platforms that can play a critical role in breaking the chain of the virus transmission. This study highlighted the role of IoT related technologies as a measure that enhances human-machine interaction, which supports the social distancing among people. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

While developing an effective vaccine can take months up to years, detection of infected patients seems like one of the best ideas for controlling the situation. The role of biosensors in containing highly pathogenic viruses, saving lives and economy is evident. A new competitive numerical platform specifically for designing microfluidic-integrated biosensors is developed and presented in this work. Properties of the biosensor, sample, buffer fluid and even the microfluidic channel can be modified in this model. This feature provides the scientific community with the ability to design a specific biosensor for requested point-of-care (POC) applications. First, the validation of the presented numerical platform against experimental data and then results and discussion, highlighting the important role of the design parameters on the performance of the biosensor is presented. For the latter, the baseline case has been set on the previous studies on the biosensors suitable for SARS-CoV, which has the highest similarity to the 2019 nCoV. Subsequently, the effects of concentration of the targeted molecules in the sample, installation position and properties of the biosensor on its performance were investigated in 11 case studies. The presented numerical framework provides an insight into understanding of the virus reaction in the design process of the biosensor and enhances our preparation for any future outbreaks. Furthermore, the integration of biosensors with different devices for accelerating the process of defeating the pandemic is proposed. © 2020 Biosensors; Computational fluid dynamics; COVID-19; Microfluidics; SARS-CoV-2 Design; Disease control; Diseases; Microfluidics; Real time systems; Simulation platform; Viruses; Computational simulation; Design parameters; Infected patients; Installation position; Integrated biosensor; Microfluidic channel; Real time monitoring system; Scientific community; Biosensors Challenges and strategies for effective plastic waste management during and post COVID-19 pandemic The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced the complexities of plastic waste management. Our improved, hyper-hygienic way of life in the fear of transmission has conveniently shifted our behavioral patterns like the use of PPE (Personal protective equipment), increased demand for plastic-packaged food and groceries, and the use of disposable utensils. The inadequacies and inefficiencies of our current waste management system to deal with the increased dependence on plastic could aggravate its mismanagement and leakage into the environment, thus triggering a new environmental crisis. Mandating scientific sterilization and the use of sealed bags for safe disposal of contaminated plastic wastes should be an immediate priority to reduce the risk of transmission to sanitation workers. Investments in circular technologies like feedstock recycling, improving the infrastructure and environmental viability of existing techniques could be the key to dealing with the plastic waste fluxes during such a crisis. Transition towards environmentally friendly materials like bioplastics and harboring new sustainable technologies would be crucial to fighting future pandemics. Although the rollbacks and relaxation of single-use plastic bans may be temporary, their likely implications on the consumer perception could hinder our long-term goals of transitioning towards a circular economy. Likewise, any delay in building international willingness and participation to curb any form of pollution through summits and agendas may also delay its implementation. Reduction in plastic pollution and at the same time promoting sustainable plastic waste management technologies can be achieved by prioritizing our policies to instill individual behavioral as well as social, institutional changes. Incentivizing measures that encourage circularity and sustainable practices, and public-private investments in research, infrastructure and marketing would help in bringing the aforementioned changes. Individual responsibility, corporate action, and government policy are all necessary to keep us from transitioning from one disaster to another. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The world economy is very threatened by the new situation, which has not bypassed the energy sector either. The mortality rate is relatively high, people are not leaving their homes, which is directly reflected in the increase of the energy consumption in the residential sector. The same is valid for water consumption. For a household located in Kragujevac (Central Serbia), 4 simulation scenarios were analyzed (S1 – reference case, S2 – mild protection measures, S3 – semi-quarantine measures, S4 – complete quarantine) to assess the link between people's behavior (on the one hand) and the consumption of natural gas, electricity and water (on the other hand), in the residential sector, in unforeseen circumstances, such as the COVID-19 virus pandemic. The analysis was conducted numerically for the month of March 2020, using EnergyPlus software packages. In defining the above scenarios, a one-minute time step schedule of people's behavior was used, taking into account the number of family members in the household, their age, occupation, lifestyle, habits (all in accordance with cultural and socio-economic circumstances), as well as the measures taken by the Government of the Republic of Serbia to fight the pandemic. Also, an analysis of energy consumption at the level of the city of Kragujevac for the past three years was made, based on data obtained from public companies – distributors (thermal energy, natural gas, electricity, water). In this paper, an analysis of air quality for the same time period was conducted, which is closely related to energy consumption and limited population movement. The simulatinos show that the consumption of natural gas can increase by 21.26% (S2), electricity by 58.39% (S4), and the consumption of water from the city water supply network by 25.45% (S3) compared to the reference case (S1). On the other hand, based on the invoice for payment of services to distributors, the actual energy consumption that was made on the analyzed house during the month of March 2020 was: natural gas (260.36 Sm3), electricity (1418 kWh), and water (22.5 m3). The conducted economic analysis showed that the largest funds at the level of the entire facility were allocated in S3 (27.33% more than in S1), and that the actual costs were 15.09% higher than in S1, and 16.41% lower than in S2. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The error correction terms (ECT) and cointegration processing tools have been applied in studies for identifying possible transmission mechanisms between distinct time series. This paper adopts the vector error correction model (VECM) to investigate the dynamic coupling between the pandemics (e.g., the COVID-19, EBOLA, MERS and SARS) and the evolution of key stocks exchange indices (e.g., Dow-Jones, S&P 500, EuroStoxx, DAX, CAC, Nikkei, HSI, Kospi, S&P ASX, Nifty and Ibov). The results show that the shocks caused by the diseases significantly affected the markets. Nonetheless, except for the COVID-19, the stock exchange indices reveal a sustained and fast recovering when an identical length time window of 79 days is analyzed. In addition, our findings contribute to point a higher volatility for all financial indices during the COVID-19, a strong impact over the Ibov-Brazil and its poor recover when compared to the other indices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Within an inevitable revamping attention on the need for government intervention to face the challenges raised by the Covid19 pandemic, industrial policy is appearing as a central piece of the puzzle. As production dynamics in every country is highly affected by the crisis, industrial policy is considered part of the response to solve dramatic economic and social problems deriving by extraordinary levels of unemployment, deprivation and poverty. In this paper, we argue that a turning point on the connection between industrial policy, sustainability and development has been reached, highlighting the need to rethink its theoretical foundations as well as its governance and implementation processes for a new role in our post-Covid 19 societies. Therefore, the research question underlying this paper deals primarily with the nexus between the debate on industrial policy and its effects in terms of human development, social cohesion and sustainability. For this reason, we attempt at closing the gap between different strands of literature, whose integrated connection leads to a new analytical framework with real-world implications on the role of industrial policy, not only as tool for productive dynamics, but also as a leverage for sustainable human development. All in all, we aim at contributing to the debate on our post-Covid19 economies and societies in two ways: firstly, by providing a new integrated analytical framework on industrial policy to steer a sustainable structural change of our economies and societies towards sustainable human development; secondly, by identifying preliminary implications on industrial policy governance and implementation, investing in the accurate and transparent design of industrial policy in the post-Covid19 era. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Covid19 pandemic; Government intervention; Industrial policy; Sustainable human development; Sustainable structural change COVID-19; human development index; industrial policy; state role; structural change; sustainability; sustainable development; viral disease Recessions and total factor productivity: Evidence from sectoral data The recent COVID-19 crisis has generated a concern that productivity (which was already at historically low levels) may further decline. From a theoretical standpoint, the recessions-total factor productivity (TFP) nexus is ambiguous à priori. This paper empirically examines the dynamic impact of recessions on TFP. We compute a new measure of utilization-adjusted productivity from a sample of 24 industries in 18 advanced economies between 1970 and 2014. Resorting to the local projection method we trace out the dynamic short to medium-term impact of such recessionary shocks. We find that deep recessions lead to a permanent deterioration in the level of total factor productivity. This effect is driven by the increase in resource misallocation across different sectors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The pandemic affects both individuals and the broader society across many domains, including physical and psychological health, the economy and general welfare. The measures taken to counteract the pandemic have significantly altered daily life and, along with the threat of contracting the coronavirus and uncertainties surrounding future developments, created a complex system of stressors with a negative impact on public mental health. This paper aims to outline the ESTSS strategy to address mental health issues related to COVID-19 and focuses on (1) trauma-informed policies, (2) capacity building, (3) collaborative research and (4) knowledge-exchange. To facilitate implementation of a trauma-informed approach and appropriate measures, ESTSS has developed a toolkit of recommendations on mental health and psychosocial assistance to be provided during the different phases of crisis and its aftermath. To promote capacity building, ESTSS offers a certification programme based on a curriculum in psychotraumatology and corresponding on-line training to the European community of mental health professionals. To assure evidence-based approaches and methods tailored to current circumstances, ESTSS has initiated a pan-European research project with international cooperation aimed at studying the mental health consequences of the pandemic, with a focus on psychological trauma and other stress-related reactions. To foster knowledge-exchange, the European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), the official journal of ESTSS, is publishing a special issue on COVID-19. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

COVID-19 pandemic is on a trajectory to cause catastrophic global upheaval with the potential to alter geopolitical and socio-economic norms. Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first ‘Green Deal’ initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19. Candidate areas for future consideration will focus on climate action, digitization, manufacturing, and sustainable food production, security, and waste mitigation. Recommendations are also provided to facilitate community transitioning, training, enterprise, and employment to low carbon economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Countries initiate public health measures to slow virus transmission, ranging from stringent quarantines including city lockdown to simpler social distancing recommendations. We use satellite readings of NO2, a pollutant emitted from socioeconomic activities, as a proxy for the level of social-economic restrictions, and discuss the implications under the influences of weather. We found that restricting SA has a leading contribution to lowering the reproductive number of COVID-19 by 18.3% ± 3.5%, while air temperature, the highest contributor among all weather-related variables only contributes 8.0% ± 2.6%. The reduction effects by restricting SA becomes more pronounced (23% ± 3.0%) when we limited the data to China and developed countries where the indoor climate is mostly controlled. We computed the spared infectees by restricting SA until mid-April. Among all polities, China spared 40,964 (95% CI 31,463-51,470) infectees with 37,727 (95% CI, 28,925-47,488) in the Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Europe spared 174,494 (95% CI 139,202-210,841) infectees, and the United States (US) spared 180,336 (95% CI 142,860-219,445) with 79,813 (95% CI 62,887-97,653) in New York State. In the same period, many regions except for China, Australia, and South Korea see a steep upward trend of spared infectees due to restricting SA with the US and Europe far steeper, signaling a greater risk of reopening the economy too soon. Latin America and Africa show less reduction of transmissivity through the region-by-time fixed effects than other regions, indicating a higher chance of becoming an epicenter soon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It is likely that the negative impacts for women and families will last for years without proactive interventions. What we commonly refer to as “the economy” would not function without the (often unrecognized) foundation of work provided by the “care economy”: the reproduction of everyday life through cooking, raising children, and so forth. The paid economy has slowed not only because people are physically not allowed into workplaces, but also because many families currently need to raise and educate their children without institutional support, which is reducing remunerated working hours and increasing stress. It has long been recognized that gross domestic product ignores the care economy and heterodox economists have promoted alternative economic systems that could value care work and facilitate a fairer sharing of domestic labor while promoting environmental and economic sustainability. This policy brief builds on recent work on the care economy to explore implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and opportunities for addressing the burden of unpaid care work. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

These workers and their dependents are in a socially vulnerable and economically difficult situation due to the dire impacts of the COVID-19. Migrant workers from Bangladesh in other countries are facing adverse impacts such as unemployment, short working hours, isolation, poor quality of living, social discrimination and mental pressure while their dependents at home are facing financial crisis due to the limited or reduced cash flow from their working relatives. A significant number of migrant workers have been sent back to Bangladesh and many are in constant fear of being sent back due to the impacts of COVID-19 in their host countries. Thus, COVID-19 intensifies numerous socio-economic crises such as joblessness, consumption of reserve funds by family members, and shrinking of the country's remittance inflow. In this situation, the most urgent and important need is to give financial security and social safety to the workers abroad and those who have returned to Bangladesh. Apart from diplomatic endeavors to maintain the status quo of policy, the government of Bangladesh may take initiatives to provide financial support to these workers as a short-term strategy to overcome hardships during the pandemic and design a comprehensive plan with a detailed database of all migrant workers to create a need-based and skilled workforce as a long-term solution. These strategies can mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 at present and address migration related problems in future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Migrant workers; National economy; Remittance; Unemployment, Bangladesh  Nanoceria as a possible agent for the management of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented global healthcare emergency and has devastated the global economy. The SARS-CoV-2 virus replicates in the host cells and is seemingly much more virulent compared to other flu viruses, as well as the SARS-CoV-1. The respiratory complications of the disease include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, and pulmonary fibrosis. Nanoceria (NC) is a versatile rare earth nanoparticle with remarkable catalase and superoxide dismutase mimetic redox regenerative properties. Interestingly, NC possesses promising anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic properties, making it an attractive tool to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 as well as the associated systemic complications. Until now, there is no clinically approved vaccine or drug for the treatment of COVID-19, and the conquest to find a novel therapy for this global havoc is being undertaken at a warlike pace. Herein, based on preclinical evidence, we hypothesize that NC owing to its unique pharmacological properties, might be an attractive preclinical candidate to win the battle over COVID-19. Further, it may be used as a prevention or treatment strategy in combination with other drugs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Lung fibrosis; Nanoceria; SARS-CoV-2 Enzymes; Medical applications; Rare earths; Viruses; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Anti-inflammatories; Global economies; Pharmacological properties; Pulmonary fibrosis; Rare earth nanoparticles; Super oxide dismutase; Systemic inflammation; Diseases; cerium oxide nanoparticle; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; nanocrystal; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; transforming growth factor beta; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antifibrotic activity; antioxidant activity; antiviral activity; Article; chronic inflammation; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug inhibition; drug mechanism; human; lung fibrosis; nanomedicine; oxidative stress; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TGF beta signaling Preventing carbon emission retaliatory rebound post-COVID-19 requires expanding free trade and improving energy efficiency Existing studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp drop in carbon emissions in 2020. A recent example of the impact of sudden extreme events on carbon emissions occurred in the 2008 global financial crisis, in which carbon emissions droped in 2009, but jumped in 2010. This study is aimed to discuss how to prevent the retaliatory growth of carbon emissions post COVID-19 through learning the lessons from analysis of short-term and long-term drivers of carbon emissions. This study explored the short-term (annual) effects (population scale. affluence level, carbon intensity, energy intensity) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emissions in the world, different income groups and selected countries before and after the 2008 financial crisis using LMDI technique. In addition, this study explored the long-term effects (energy consumption per capita, energy structure, energy intensity, foreign direct investment, and trade openness) of changes in carbon emissions by decomposing carbon emission in the world and different income groups from 1990 to 2014 using VAR technique. The decomposition results of short-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that the deterioration in energy efficiency (increase in energy intensity) was the main reason for the retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-2008 financial crisis, especially in high-income countries. The decomposition results of long-term drivers of carbon emission uncovered that trade openness contributed to reduce carbon emission in the world and the incomes groups in the long term, although trade openness led to increase in carbon emission in developing countries in the short term. To prevent retaliatory rebound of carbon emissions, what we should learn two lessons from the decomposition of carbon emission: improving energy efficiency, and expanding trade openness. Unfortunately, energy efficiency has been neglected in the economic recovery plans to respond to COVID-19 of various countries, especially developed countries, and worse, trade protectionism is on the rise, especially in developed countries. Therefore, we are pessimistic about preventing a retaliatory rebound in carbon emissions post-COVID-19 for now. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. 2008 economic crisis; Coronavirus; COVID-19 pandemic; Economy recovery; Global recession Decomposition; Deterioration; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; International trade; Investments; Carbon intensity; Developed countries; Economic recovery; Energy structures; Foreign direct investments; Global financial crisis; Long-term effects; Trade protectionism; Carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; COVID-19; decomposition analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; epidemic; financial crisis; pollution tax; viral disease; Article; carbon footprint; coronavirus disease 2019; decomposition; developing country; economic aspect; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental parameters; foreign direct investment; high income country; income group; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; economic development; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Coronavirus Infections; Economic Development; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral The impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on faith-based investments: An original analysis This paper examines the rapid spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) and its short-term impact on the Shariah-compliant UK Dow Jones market index to capture the dynamic behavior of stock returns at economy and industry levels. Using daily data over the period January 20 to May 20 and ten UK industrial sector groupings, the findings suggest a strong and statistically significant relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the performance of the conventional stock market index. The findings also suggest that the disease interacts negatively but insignificantly with the Dow Jones faith-based ethical (Islamic) index compared to its UK counterpart. In addition, through an analysis of sector groupings, the paper shows that the stock returns of the information technology sector performed significantly better than the market, while stock returns of consumer discretionary sector, which includes transportation, beverages, tourism and leisure, consumer services performed significantly worse than the market during the COVID-19 outbreak. Other sector groupings fail to yield significantly plausible parameter values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

There is an immediate need for identification of effective drugs to contain the disastrous virus outbreak. Global efforts are already underway at a war footing to identify the best drug combination to address the disease. In this review, an attempt has been made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, and based on this information potential druggable targets against SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. Also, the strategies for ongoing and future drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are outlined. Given the urgency to find a definitive cure, ongoing drug repurposing efforts being carried out by various organizations are also described. The unprecedented crisis requires extraordinary efforts from the scientific community to effectively address the issue and prevent further loss of human lives and health. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.

Coronavirus disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2 originated from China and spread across every corner of the world. The scientific interest on COVID-19 increased after WHO declared it a pandemic in the early February of 2020. In fact, this pandemic has had a worldwide impact on economy, health, and lifestyle like no other in the last 100 years. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Coronaviridae family and causes the deadliest clinical manifestations when compared to other viruses in the family. COVID-19 is an emerging zoonotic disease that has resulted in over 383,000 deaths around the world. Scientists are scrambling for ideas to develop treatment and prevention strategies to thwart the disease condition. In this review, we have attempted to summarize the latest information on the virus, disease, prevention, and treatment strategies. The future looks promising. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2  Navigating COVID-19 with emotional intelligence Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. COVID-19 has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closure of schools, colleges and universities. The COVID-19 pandemic is also having a dramatic impact on societies and economies around the world. With various measures of lockdowns and social distancing in place, it becomes important to understand emotional intelligence of faculty members working in institutions of higher learning on a large scale in this pandemic. Aim: The purpose of this article is to examine the perception of faculty members toward their emotional intelligence during COVID-19 and to study the impact of demographic variables on their emotional intelligence. Method: The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The data for the study were collected through both the primary and secondary sources. Online questionnaires were used to gather the primary data. The measuring items used for the study were sourced from existing validated scales and literature. Descriptive statistics was employed to know the descriptive information across various demographic variables on a total sample of 683. The various demographic variables, which were considered for the study, were gender and designation. Results: The results revealed that the faculty members perceived their emotional intelligence at an above-average level in the present pandemic, that is, COVID-19. The results also revealed that the perception of the respondent faculty members toward their emotional intelligence from different universities and states is more or less the same and also the demographic variable gender has a significant impact on emotional intelligence during the present pandemic. Conclusion: Besides having theoretical implications that open pathways for conducting further research, the findings of the study may serve as a reference for service practitioners in designing strategies that will ensure superior performance of faculty members in higher educational institutions during the pandemic. © The Author(s) 2020.

By the end of May, more than 6 million people were diagnosed with this infection. Twitter witnessed an outpouring of anxious tweets through messages associated with the spread of the virus. Government and health officials replied to the troubling tweets, reassuring the public with regular alerts on the virus's progress and information to defend against the virus. We observe that social media users are worried about Covid 19-related crisis and we identify three separate conversations on virus contagion, prevention, and the economy. We analyze the tone of officials’ tweet text as alarming and reassuring and capture the response of Twitter users to official communications. Such studies can provide insights to health officials and government agencies for crisis management, specifically regarding communicating emergency information to the public via social media for establishing reassurance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Alarming; Analytics; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Crisis management; Government; Reassurance; Social media; Twitter Viruses; Coronaviruses; Crisis management; Emergency information; Exponential rates; Government agencies; Social media; Social networking (online) COVID-19 pandemic, health risks, and economic consequences: Evidence from China This paper introduces the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model into the Bewley-type incomplete market model and uses it to study the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on China's macroeconomics. The calibrated model predicts that the average propensity to consume household wealth will decline, while the demand for money will increase, and these predictions are consistent with the data. Monetary policy is effective because it provides enough liquidity for households to buffer health risks. Monetary stimulus is more effective in an economy with greater health risks and consumption uncertainty. Counterfactual experiments show that abandoning the containment policy too early would avoid a sharp drop in output and employment in the short term, but it would greatly increase mortality and ultimately lead to a decline in social welfare. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe has resulted a newer challenge and paradigm for an evolving socio-scientific priorities. It is generally expected that the impacts of the pandemic would be in shorter time-scale, while the planned time and pathway for attaining the SDG are typically mandated in longer-term, hence may remain mostly unaffected. However, the stringent lockdown measures, isolated economies and financial burden to contain the pandemic emergency have resulted to slowdown of socio-economic development, which if continues for a longer period, would put a question mark on developing plans and pathways to achieve the SDGs, even in decadal-scale. Hence, in these newer times, it is important to understand the real priorities of availability of clean water and air, which are already stressed worldwide and in India, because of various natural and human-influenced triggers. This ongoing pandemic has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the impact of human development and consequent feedback of nature and human society in pre- and post-COVID scenarios on water–air–human life, which can help to re-think and re-orient the societal development priorities. It is a rare opportunity for scientists to impress the policy-makers with real-time examples on the efficacies of potential mitigation strategies for climate change, water and air pollution, and the importance of enduring investment on environmental causes and consequent benefits that can secure health and development for our future generations.

We develop a fever curve for the Swiss economy using publicly available daily financial market and news data. The indicator can be computed with a delay of 1 day. Moreover, it is highly correlated with macroeconomic data and survey indicators of Swiss economic activity. Therefore, it provides timely and reliable warning signals if the health of the economy takes a turn for the worse. © 2020, The Author(s).

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as an emerging therapeutic option for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, numerous clinical trials have been registered to examine the safety and efficacy of different types of MSCs and their exosomes for treating COVID-19 patients, with less published data on the mechanism of action. Although there is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19 as of yet, MSC therapies showed an improvement in the treatment of some COVID-19 patients. MSC’s therapeutic effect is displayed in their ability to reduce the cytokine storm, enhance alveolar fluid clearance, and promote epithelial and endothelial recovery; however, the safest and most effective route of MSC delivery remains unclear. The use of poorly characterized MSC products remains one of the most significant drawbacks of MSC-based therapy, which could theoretically promote the risk for thromboembolism. Optimizing the clinical-grade production of MSCs and establishing a consensus on registered clinical trials based on cell-product characterization and mode of delivery would aid in laying the foundation for a safe and effective therapy in COVID-19. In this review, we shed light on the mechanistic view of MSC therapeutic role based on preclinical and clinical studies on acute lung injury and ARDS; therefore, offering a unique correlation and applicability in COVID-19 patients. We further highlight the challenges and opportunities in the use of MSC-based therapy. © 2020, The Author(s).

Monitoring and documenting government strategies during the COVID-19 crisis is crucial to understand the progression of the epidemic. Following a content analysis strategy of existing public information sources, we developed a specific hierarchical coding scheme for NPIs. We generated a comprehensive structured dataset of government interventions and their respective timelines of implementation. To improve transparency and motivate collaborative validation process, information sources are shared via an open library. We also provide codes that enable users to visualise the dataset. Standardization and structure of the dataset facilitate inter-country comparison and the assessment of the impacts of different NPI categories on the epidemic parameters, population health indicators, the economy, and human rights, among others. This dataset provides an in-depth insight of the government strategies and can be a valuable tool for developing relevant preparedness plans for pandemic. We intend to further develop and update this dataset until the end of December 2020. © 2020, The Author(s).

This has warranted a comprehensive policy response from both fiscal and monetary policy. The monetary policy response has been directed at supporting households and businesses by keeping funding costs low and ensuring credit is available. The monetary policy actions have worked as expected by lowering the key interest rate benchmarks in the economy to historically low levels, which has been transmitted through to historically low borrowing rates for households and businesses, as well as governments. © 2020 Reserve Bank of Australia Australia; Covid-19 virus; Economic and financial impact; Fiscal policy; Government bonds; Interest rates; Liquidity; Monetary policy  Molecular mechanisms of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and potential anti-COVID19 pharmacological targets since the outbreak of the pandemic The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a severe threat against public health and global economies. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, is highly contagious and has led to an ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 affects, mainly, the respiratory system, with most severe cases primarily showcasing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, no targeted therapy exists, and since the number of infections and death toll keeps rising, it has become a necessity to study possible therapeutic targets. Antiviral drugs can target various stages of the viral infection, and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, both structural and non-structural proteins have been proposed as potential drug targets. This review focuses on the most researched SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their structure, function, and possible therapeutic approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic; Protein; SARS-CoV-2; Spike  The science of social distancing and total lock down: Does it work? whom does it benefit? COVID-19 is spiralling like wild fire and has caused a global mayhem. Many lives have already been lost, and the global economy is at stake. In the absence of vaccine, social distancing and total lock down is the current mainstay in efforts to mitigate and flatten the epidemic curves. Several countries across the globe are currently implementing social distancing and total lock downs. However, what is social distancing and lock down? Does it work? Whom does it benefit? We expound on these questions and conclude that social distancing and lock down benefit the local and international community alike. Moreover, we hypothesis that evacuations may facilitate international spread of a highly contagious disease of pandemic potential. © 2020 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum Ltd., UK.

The catastrophic impact a pandemic has on humans and economy should serve as a reminder to be better prepared to the advent of known and unknown pathogens in the future. The goal of having a set of initiatives and procedures to tackle them is the need of the hour. Rapid detection and point-of-care (POC) analysis of pathogens causing these diseases is not only a problem entailing the scientific community but also raises challenges in tailoring appropriate treatment strategies to the healthcare sector. Among the various methods used to detect pathogens, Electrochemical Biosensor Technology is at the forefront in the development of POC devices. Electrochemical Biosensors stand in good stead due to their rapid response, high sensitivity and selectivity and ease of miniaturization to name a few advantages. This review explores the innovations in electrochemical biosensing based on the various electroanalytical techniques including voltammetry, impedance, amperometry and potentiometry and discusses their potential in diagnosis of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (Re-EIDs), which are potential pandemic threats. © 2020 Amperometry; Corona Virus; COVID-19; Impedance; Potentiometry; Voltammetry Biosensors; Diagnosis; Electroanalytical techniques; Electrochemical biosensing; Electrochemical biosensor; Emerging infectious disease; Healthcare sectors; High sensitivity; Re-emerging infectious disease; Scientific community; Diseases Receptor-binding domain-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively, have posed severe threats to global public health and the economy. Treatment and prevention of these viral diseases call for the research and development of human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NMAbs). Scientists have screened neutralizing antibodies using the virus receptor-binding domain (RBD) as an antigen, indicating that RBD contains multiple conformational neutralizing epitopes, which are the main structural domains for inducing neutralizing antibodies and T-cell immune responses. This review summarizes the structure and function of RBD and RBD-specific NMAbs against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 currently under development. © 2020, The Author(s).  angiotensin converting enzyme 2; epitope; immunoglobulin G; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; virus RNA; virus spike protein; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; protein binding; virus antibody; virus receptor; binding assay; binding site; cellular immunity; coronavirus disease 2019; crystal structure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; epidemic; epitope mapping; follow up; gene mutation; gene sequence; human; IC50; ID50; immunization; mortality rate; nonhuman; receptor binding; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus load; virus neutralization; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; biosynthesis; chemistry; Coronavirus infection; cross reaction; drug effect; immunology; metabolism; molecular model; pandemic; pathogenicity; protein secondary structure; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; ultrastructure; virion; virology; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Epitopes; Humans; Models, Molecular; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Receptors, Virus; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Virion Safeguarding Grandma's fermented beverage recipes for food security: Food safety challenges Fermented products are mainly produced at the household level and consumed as stable foods by local people, and sold on local markets; majority of them are unknown by up-market population. Recently, public information on potential health benefits of fermented products increased the demand for them and consumers’ willingness to pay, especially during COVID-19. Integration of these products to the global market is essential for food security, sustainable production, success of the food market, and the economy of the country. However, pre- and post-processing contamination and product inconsistency constitute a major challenge to the market value of traditional food products. The Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) was applied for quantification of risk analysis of ten traditional fermented beverages that majority of them are virtually less well known outside of the specific regions of Turkey. Generally speaking, high risk priority numbers, (RPN≤720), were commonly observed in majority of productions since they were using intensive human handling, applying obsolete technologies, and employing people that have no food processing and hygiene training. It is concluded that improving a technology and integration of local peoplecentered, knowledge-based support programs were required for sustainable production of these products. Comprehensive real data collected from visits to farms located in different regions of Turkey over six years were used for the analysis. Results from this study may help manufacturers from different parts of the world in producing safer fermented beverages that share common ingredients, equipment, and manufacturing stages. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Data acquired from 28 long-term air quality stations across the U.S. revealed widespread but nonuniform reductions of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) during the first phase of lockdown (March 15–April 25, 2020) relative to a pre-lockdown reference period and historical baselines established in 2017–2019. The reductions, up to 49% for NO2 and 37% for CO, are statistically significant at two thirds of the sites and tend to increase with local population density. Significant reductions of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) only occurred in the Northeast and California/Nevada metropolises where NO2 declined the most, while the changes in ozone (O3) were mixed and relatively minor. These findings are consistent with lower transportation and utility demands that dominate NO2 and CO emissions, especially in major urban areas, due to the lockdown. This study provides an insight into potential public health benefits with more aggressive air quality management, which should be factored into strategies to reopen the U.S. and global economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It is largely unknown how the human immune system responds to this infection. A better understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 will be important to develop therapeutics against COVID-19. Here, we have used transcriptomic profile of human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells (A549) infected with SARS-CoV-2 and employed a network biology approach to generate human-virus interactome. Network topological analysis discovers 15 SARS-CoV-2 targets, which belongs to a subset of interferon (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs (IFIT1, IFITM1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1, and OAS2) can be considered as potential candidates for drug targets in the treatments of COVID-19. We have identified significant interaction between ISGs and TLR3 agonists, like poly I: C, and imiquimod, and suggests that TLR3 agonists can be considered as a potential drug for drug repurposing in COVID-19. Our network centric analysis suggests that moderating the innate immune response is a valuable approach to target COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It has caused 9+ million confirmed cases and 400,000+ deaths at the time of writing and triggered unprecedented preventative measures that have confined a substantial portion of the global population and established ‘social distancing’ as a new global behavioral norm. The COVID-19 crisis has affected all aspects of everyday life and work, and heavily impacted the global economy. This crisis also offers unprecedented insights into how the global climate crisis may be managed, as there are many parallels between the COVID-19 crisis and what we expect from the imminent global climate emergency. Reflecting upon the challenges of today's crisis may help us better prepare for the future. Here we compile a list, by no means comprehensive, of the similarities and differences between the two crises, and the lessons we can learn from them: (i) High momentum trends, (ii) Irreversible changes, (iii) Social and spatial inequality, (iv) Weakening of international solidarity, and (v) Less costly to prevent than to cure. © 2020 Climate change; Climate emergency; COVID-19 Environmental engineering; Pollution; Global climates; Global economies; Global population; Irreversible changes; Climate change; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; climate change; COVID-19; economic impact; global climate; global economy; respiratory disease; viral disease; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; coronavirus disease 2019; daily life activity; economic recession; financial management; health care disparity; human; incidence; incubation time; infection prevention; international cooperation; isolation; job performance; pandemic; priority journal; resource management; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social aspect; social distance; social status; unemployment; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Climate Change; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Air pollution in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 State of Emergency In March of 2020, the province of Ontario declared a State of Emergency (SOE) to reduce the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This disruption to the economy provided an opportunity to measure change in air pollution when the population spends more time at home with fewer trips. Hourly air pollution observations were obtained for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Ontario air monitoring network for 2020 and the previous five years. The analysis is focused on a five-week period during the SOE with a previous five-week period used as a control. Fine particulate matter did not show any significant reductions during the SOE. Ozone concentrations at 12 of the 32 monitors were lower than any of the previous five-years; however, four locations were above average. Average ozone concentrations were 1 ppb lower during the SOE, but this ranged at individual monitors from 1.5 ppb above to 4.2 ppb below long-term conditions. Nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario, and both pollutants displayed their lowest concentrations for 22 of 29 monitors. Individual monitors ranged from 1 ppb (nitrogen dioxide) and 5 ppb (nitrogen oxides) above average to 4.5 (nitrogen dioxide) and 7.1 ppb (nitrogen oxides) below average. Overall, both nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario in response to the COVID-19 SOE, ozone concentrations suggested a possible reduction, and fine particulate matter has not varied from historic concentrations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Following efforts to mitigate disease spread, with a significant decline in some regions, many states began reopening their economies. As social distancing guidelines were relaxed and businesses opened, local outbreaks of COVID-19 continue to place person on healthcare systems. Among medical specialties, otolaryngologists and their staff are among the highest at risk for becoming exposed to COVID-19. As otolaryngologists prepare to weather the storm of impending local surges in COVID-19 infections there are several practical measures that can be taken to mitigate the risk to ourselves and our staff. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The global extent of the epidemic and government controls, restrictions and constraints have led to imbalances in world trade and have put many companies under pressure. The epidemic is a test of individual companies' ability to operate effectively in the new environment. It is up to managers to mitigate its impact on business. The aim of the article is to identify the activities of employers in Poland related to the protection of workers with the developing epidemic COVID-19. Methods: A survey was carried out among the employees of OHS services employed in enterprises in Poland. The research was conducted in three stages at two-week intervals. The obtained results were subjected to statistical analyses. Results: In the analysed three periods a total of 588 answers were obtained, which allowed to formulate conclusions. The research showed that in connection with the COVID-19 epidemic, about 30% of the plants updated their occupational risk assessment, about 40% updated their safety instructions, about 90% of the plants equipped their employees with additional personal protective equipment. Conclusions: The COVID-19 outbreak in Poland resulted in taking additional actions by employers to protect workers. Systematicity (methodicality) of these activities depended mainly on the seniority of the OHS service. As a border internship indicating a different approach to an emergency situation related to the epidemic, 7 years were set. © 2020 COVID-19 epidemic; Enterprises; Health and safety at work; Health and safety service; Occupational risk International trade; Occupational risks; Personnel; Protective clothing; Risk assessment; Emergency situation; Global economies; Personal protective equipment; Safety instructions; Systematicity; World trade; Epidemiology; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; employer; epidemic; female; human; male; occupational hazard; occupational health service; Poland; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; safety; work environment; work experience Time series forecasting of Covid-19 using deep learning models: India-USA comparative case study Covid-19 is a highly contagious virus which almost freezes the world along with its economy. Its ability of human-to-human and surface-to-human transmission turns the world into catastrophic phase. In this study, our aim is to predict the future conditions of novel Coronavirus to recede its impact. We have proposed deep learning based comparative analysis of Covid-19 cases in India and USA. The datasets of confirmed and death cases of Covid-19 are taken into consideration. The recurrent neural network (RNN) based variants of long short term memory (LSTM) such as Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM and Convolutional LSTM are used to design the proposed methodology and forecast the Covid-19 cases for one month ahead. Convolution LSTM outperformed the other two models and predicts the Covid-19 cases with high accuracy and very less error for all four datasets of both countries. Upward/downward trend of forecasted Covid-19 cases are also visualized graphically, which would be helpful for researchers and policy makers to mitigate the mortality and morbidity rate by streaming the Covid-19 into right direction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Covid-19; Deep learning; Forecasting; LSTM; Recurrent neural networks; Time series Convolution; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Viruses; Bi-directional; Comparative analysis; Coronaviruses; High-accuracy; Learning models; Policy makers; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Time series forecasting; Deep learning An analysis on the panic during COVID-19 pandemic through an online form With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference (p = 0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference (p = 0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indifference, Annihilation, Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness. In conclusion, levels of health anxiety were consistent regardless of location and exposure to COVID-19 patients. Lastly, spectrum of panic consequences due to COVID-19 pandemic were constructed. © 2020 Covid-19; Crisis; Illness anxiety; Pandemic; Panic adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety; Article; avoidance behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; destruction; family; fear; government; health behavior; health survey; human; hypochondriasis; information dissemination; optimism; pandemic; panic; paranoia; priority journal; protocol compliance; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; sadness; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; middle aged; online system; questionnaire; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle Aged; Online Systems; Pandemics; Panic; Panic Disorder; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult Modelling and forecasting of new cases, deaths and recover cases of COVID-19 by using Vector Autoregressive model in Pakistan COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has now spread around the world causes damage to human life and economy. Pakistan is also severely effected by COVID-19 with 202,955 confirmed cases and total deaths of 4,118. Vector Autoregressive time series models was used to forecast new daily confirmed cases, deaths and recover cases for ten days. Our forecasted model results show maximum of 5,363/day new cases with 95% confidence interval of 3,013–8,385 on 3rd of July, 167/day deaths with 95% confidence interval of 112–233 and maximum recoveries 4,016/day with 95% confidence interval of 2,182–6,405 in the next 10 days. The findings of this research may help government and other agencies to reshape their strategies according to the forecasted situation. As the data generating process is identified in terms of time series models, then it can be updated with the arrival of new data and provide forecasted scenario in future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Confirmed cases; COVID-19; Death; Forecasting; Recoveries; Vector Autoregressive model, Time series Time series; Autoregressive time series; Confidence interval; Human lives; Model results; Modelling and forecasting; Time series models; Vector autoregressive model; Wuhan , China; Recovery Covid-19 pandemic and food: Present knowledge, risks, consumers fears and safety Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that has paralyzed social life and the economy around the world since the end of 2019, and which has so far killed nearly 600,000 people. The rapidity of its spread and the lack of detailed research on the course and methods of transmission significantly impede both its eradication and prevention. Scope and approach: Due to the high transmission rate and fatality resulting from COVID-19 disease, the paper focuses on analyzing the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 as well as its potential connection with food as a source of pathogen and infection. Key findings and conclusions: There is currently no evidence (scientific publications, WHO, EFSA etc.) that COVID-19 disease can spread directly through food and the human digestive system. However, according to the hypothesis regarding the primary transmission of the virus, the source of which was food of animal origin (meat of wild animals), as well as the fact that food is a basic necessity for humans, it is worth emphasizing that food can, if not directly, be a carrier of the virus. Particular attention should be paid to this indirect pathway when considering the potential for the spread of an epidemic and the development of prevention principles. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Food safety; Prevention; Virus transmission Animals; Digestive system; Transmissions; Viruses; Food of animal origin; High transmission rate; Primary transmission; Scientific publications; Social life; Wild animals; Diseases Memory-based meso-scale modeling of Covid-19: County-resolved timelines in Germany The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented world-wide effort to gather data, model, and understand the viral spread.

However, to this end accurate models are of essence that capture both the viral spread and the courses of disease in space and time at reasonable resolution. Here, we combine a spatially resolved county-level infection model for Germany with a memory-based integro-differential approach capable of directly including medical data on the course of disease, which is not possible when using traditional SIR-type models. We calibrate our model with data on cumulative detected infections and deaths from the Robert-Koch Institute and demonstrate how the model can be used to obtain county- or even city-level estimates on the number of new infections, hospitality rates and demands on intensive care units. We believe that the present work may help guide decision makers to locally fine-tune their expedient response to potential new outbreaks in the near future. © 2020, The Author(s).

In India, human activities were restricted from late March 2020. This ‘anthropogenic emissions switch-off’ presented an opportunity to investigate impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on ambient air quality in five Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to 2020. For each year, we isolated, analysed and compared fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data from 25 March to 11 May, to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Like other global cities, we observed substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations, from 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41–53% (Delhi), 26–54% (Hyderabad), 24–36% (Kolkata), and 10–39% (Mumbai). Generally, cities with larger traffic volumes showed greater reductions. Aerosol loading decreased by 29% (Chennai), 11% (Delhi), 4% (Kolkata), and 1% (Mumbai) against 2019 data. Health and related economic impact assessments indicated 630 prevented premature deaths during lockdown across all five cities, valued at 0.69 billion USD. Improvements in air quality may be considered a temporary lockdown benefit as revitalising the economy could reverse this trend. Regulatory bodies must closely monitor air quality levels, which currently offer a baseline for future mitigation plans. © 2020 The Author(s) Air pollution; Coronavirus pandemic; Emission switch-off; Health and economic impacts; PM2.5 concentration; SARS-CoV-2 Virus Air quality; Ambient air quality; Anthropogenic emissions; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); In-situ measurement; Mitigation measures; PM2.5 concentration; Substantial reduction; Particles (particulate matter) Can digitization mitigate the economic damage of a pandemic? Evidence from SARS The work presented in this paper uses empirical evidence to highlight the important role digital technology plays in mitigating a pandemic's economic disruption. As extensive datasets including the effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic are still unavailable, this study provides an assessment of the role of digitization at the time of SARS in 2003. Results are robust in pointing out that those countries with better broadband connectivity were able to mitigate some of the economic losses incurred by the pandemic. While anecdotal evidence is plentiful even for COVID-19, this study provides rigorous analysis to support that a reliable telecommunications infrastructure and a high level of digitization is crucial to keep the economy running under pandemic conditions. These results provide valuable evidence for the current context of COVID-19, which has resulted in several national lockdowns around the world. In consequence, we believe that the public and private sectors must collaborate and work together to promote the enhancement of the digital ecosystem. In the long run, a suitable regulatory framework seems crucial to stimulate private investments to close the digital supply gap, as well as promoting the digitization of business process and the training of the workforce to acquire digital skills. In the short term, we discuss several measures that can be taken to accommodate the expected increases in internet traffic in such circumstances and maintain the quality of service. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Digital ecosystem; Pandemics; Telecommunications Investments; Losses; Anecdotal evidences; Broadband connectivity; Digital technologies; Private investment; Public and private sector; Regulatory frameworks; Rigorous analysis; Telecommunications infrastructures; Quality of service The pandemic under siege: A view from the Gaza Strip In this article I argue that while the COVID-19 outbreak is at its early stages in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian coastal enclave is particularly vulnerable to its effects – not least due to the multiplicity of existing development challenges that have resulted from an ongoing Israeli and Egyptian-imposed blockade. With the economy at a standstill, the Palestinian governing authority has limited financial resources to (re)build key sanitation, hygiene, waste treatment and water supply infrastructure. These (infrastructural) inadequacies, while already a public health concern before the onset of the pandemic, now renders Gaza particularly vulnerable to the spread of viruses and diseases. Additionally, the limited movement of goods because of the siege has led to an acute shortage of medical supplies and equipment that are essential for combating a pandemic. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 outbreak is also “unique” in that it presents Gaza with a crisis that has little to do with the hostilities that define the politics of Israel-Palestine. Yet, the potential of a widespread outbreak also lays bare to the development challenges that Gaza faces as a result of the conflict. This, I conclude, provides an opportunity for the donor community to, under pretext of combating the pandemic, remedy some of the consequences of the conflict and siege without having to contend with the (political) stigma of doing so. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Development; Gaza Strip; Middle East; Pandemic; Public Health; Siege  Unique fibrinogen-binding motifs in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS CoV-2: Potential implications in host-pathogen interactions Novel Coronavirus (SARS CoV-2), the etiological agent for the highly contagious Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has threatened global health and economy infecting around 5.8 million people and causing over 359,200 deaths (as of 28th May 2020, https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The clinical manifestations of infected patients generally range from asymptomatic or mild to severe illness, or even death. The ability of the virus to evade the host immune response have been major reasons for high morbidity and mortality. One of the important clinical observations under conditions of critical illness show increased risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. Molecular mechanisms of how SARS CoV-2 induces such conditions still remain unclear. This report describes the presence of two unique motifs in the SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N-protein) that can potentially interact with fibrinogen and possibly prothrombin. This is based on an established function of secretory proteins in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-coagulase, Efb (Extracellular fibrinogen binding) and vWBP (von Willebrand factor Binding Protein), which are known to regulate the blood clotting cascade and the functions of host immune response. It is hypothesized that having protein interaction motifs that are homologous to these S. aureus proteins, the N-protein of this virus can mimic their functions, which may in turn play a crucial role in formation of blood clots in the host and help the virus evade host immune response. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in vitro. Considering the overwhelming increase in the incidence of SARS CoV-2 infection globally, this information may be useful for further investigation and could help in deducing new therapeutic strategies to combat advanced stages of this disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Coagulase; Coronavirus; Fibrinogen; Immune evasion; Motif coagulase; fibrinogen; nucleocapsid protein; prothrombin; secretory protein; virus phosphoprotein; von Willebrand factor; Article; blood clotting; human; immune evasion; immune response; molecular mimicry; nonhuman; protein binding; protein function; protein motif; protein protein interaction; regulatory mechanism; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Staphylococcus aureus; virus cell interaction; virus immunity Impact of COVID-19 Measures on Short-Term Electricity Consumption in the Most Affected EU Countries and USA States Energy Policy; Energy Engineering; Energy Resources; Energy Management © 2020 The Author(s)As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, governments have been implementing a wide range of measures to contain it, from movement restrictions to economy-wide shutdowns. Understanding their impacts is essential to support better policies for countries still experiencing outbreaks or in case of emergence of subsequent pandemic waves. Here we show that the cumulative decline in electricity consumption within the 5 months following the stay-home orders ranges between 3% and 12% in the most affected EU countries and USA states, except Florida, which shows no significant impact. Italy, France, Spain, California, Austria, and New York have recovered baseline consumption by the end of July, whereas Great Britain and Germany remain below baseline levels. We also show that the relationship between measures stringency and daily decline in electricity consumption is nonlinear. These results illustrate the severity of the crisis across countries and can support further research on the effect of specific measures. © 2020 The Author(s) Energy Engineering; Energy Management; Energy Policy; Energy Resources  COVID-19 Vaccine: A comprehensive status report The current COVID-19 pandemic has urged the scientific community internationally to find answers in terms of therapeutics and vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. Published investigations mostly on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS has taught lessons on vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus. This is attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on the host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances. The COVID-19 pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after Spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted immune-potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this virus. This review is aimed at providing an overview of the efforts dedicated to an effective vaccine for this novel coronavirus which has crippled the world in terms of economy, human health and life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To proceed, panel regression models are first applied with a time-lag effect to estimate the general effects of COVID-19 on daily tourist arrivals. In turn, the data set is decomposed into two nation groups and fixed effects models are employed for addressing the comparison of the pandemic-tourism relationship between economies with and without experiences of the SARS epidemic. Specifically, Taiwan and Hong Kong are grouped as economies with SARS experiences, while Thailand and New Zealand are grouped as countries without experiences of SARS. The estimation result indicates that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has a significant negative impact on tourism demand, in which a 1% COVID-19 case increase causes a 0.075% decline in tourist arrivals, which is a decline of approximately 110 arrivals for every additional person infected by the coronavirus. The negative impact of COVID-19 on tourist arrivals for Thailand and New Zealand is found much stronger than for Taiwan and Hong Kong. In particular, the number of tourist arrivals to Taiwan and Hong Kong decreased by 0.034% in response to a 1% increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases, while in Thailand and New Zealand, a 1% national confirmed cases increase caused a 0.103% reduction in tourism demand. Moreover, the effect of the number of domestic cases on international tourism is found lower than the effect caused by global COVID-19 mortality for the economies with SARS experiences. In contrast, tourist arrivals are majorly affected by the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand and New Zealand. Finally, travel restriction in all cases is found to be the most influencing factor for the number of tourist arrivals. Besides contributing to the existing literature focusing on the knowledge regarding the nexus between tourism and COVID-19, the paper’s findings also highlight the importance of risk perception and the need of transmission prevention and control of the epidemic for the tourism sector. © 2020 by the authors.

As a result, many small-scale food producers faced difficulties growing, harvesting, and selling their goods. This participatory research examines local small-scale farmers’ challenges as farmers but also as consumers and their coping strategies during the month of April and one week in June 2020. The study was initiated and conceptualized in collaboration with small-scale farmer members of an existing research network in selected urban and rural areas in South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Indonesia. Participants co-designed the research, collected and uploaded data through digital survey tools, and contributed to data analysis and interpretation. A common observation across regions is that the measures imposed in response to COVID-19 highlighted and partly exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities among food system actors. Strict lockdowns in Cape Town, South Africa, and Masvingo, Zimbabwe, significantly restricted the production capacity of small-scale farmers in the informal economy and created more food insecurity for them. In Maputo, Mozambique, and Toraja and Java, Indonesia, local food systems continued to operate and were even strengthened by higher social capital and adaptive capacities. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to its fast dissemination, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020. Aiming to contain the spread of the virus, leaders of many countries restrained social movement, targeting to flatten the curve of contamination with social distancing. This review aimed to analyze how human behavior has changed throughout this period. We also approached the key components of the emotional reaction to the pandemic, how internal and external factors, such as personality traits, gender, the media, the economy and the governmental response, influence the social perception of the pandemic and the psychological outcomes of the current scenario. Moreover, we explored in depth the groups at increased risk of suffering mental health burden secondary to these circumstances. These include the healthcare professionals, elderly individuals, children, college students, black subjects, latin and LGBTQ+ communities, economically disadvantaged groups, the homeless, prisoners, the rural population and psychiatric patients. We also discussed several measures that might minimize the emotional impact derived from this scenario. It is crucial that the health authorities, the government and the population articulate to assist the vulnerable groups and promote emotional and psychological support strategies. Moreover, it is fundamental that the population is provided with accurate information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Pedrosa, Bitencourt, Fróes, Cazumbá, Campos, de Brito and Simões e Silva. behavior; COVID-19; mental health; psychological changes; restricting measures; SARS-CoV-2; social isolation  Platform and data co-operatives amidst European pandemic citizenship Many European pandemic citizens will likely be unemployed during the COVID-19 crisis. This article explores whether it is possible to alter existing data governance extractivist models to incentivize the emergence of platform and data co-operatives to protect European pandemic citizens’ labor and digital rights. As such, this article aims to decipher the rationale behind the proliferation of platform and data co-operatives by responding to how new forms of co-operatives using digital technologies can provide feasible socio-economic alternatives to improve post-COVID-19 working conditions for vulnerable or already empowered pandemic citizens. This article is structured as follows. First, the European “pandemic citizenship” term is described. Second, the rationale of this article is consequently presented. Third, the research question, two hypotheses, and the action research triangulation are described. The deployment of the triangulation methodology based on action research, mixed methods and social innovation reveals the main findings through (i) Delphi study results, (ii) a taxonomy for platform and data co-operative cases, and ultimately, (iii) fieldwork research conducted in Glasgow, Barcelona and Tallinn. This article concludes that co-operatives (platform-based or data-driven), stemming from the potential resilient response of European pandemic citizens, may currently portray a feasible alternative to data governance extractivist models. © 2020 by the author.

Confronting the continuing economic sanctions, the flood disaster, and the COVID 19, North Korea is now in a critical phase whether the North Korean economy will shift to a sustainable economy or, as it has done in the past three decades, barely manage to maintain at a survival level. To explore the question, this study investigates North Korea’s economic policy changes by extracting the keywords from the North Korean economic journal Economic Research, which is a representative state published document. We use a text mining approach to overcome limitations, such as the lack of objectivity and accuracy of the classification of topics in manual text analysis for North Korean studies. Contrary to the conventional assumption that the North Korean economic policies are driven by dogmatic Juche (self-reliance) ideology, we find that the strategy of economic policies differs depending on the leader and political and economic circumstances at the time. In particular, since Kim Jong-un assumed office in 2011, the topics have diversified, and now cover a wide range of subjects on capitalism. Nevertheless, without North Korea’s decisive reform measures and international cooperation, it will be hard to observe that the North Korean economy can go beyond ‘muddling-through’ for sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

This issue had not been studied on a broader international level earlier. This research firstly discovers altruism and volunteerism values in the economy. Then, based on the third-party model, observes each part, where participants are the (1) volunteer (employee) (2) company (and its CSR activity) and (3) an external organization, which manages this type of formal volunteerism. Each participant was analyzed through comprehensive analysis using descriptive and inference statistics and classification methods on complex, extensive secondary databases. Altogether, more than 10,000 respondents’ answers are examined from two worldwide surveys, and further ten international statistical indicators and indices are explored. These methods result in volunteer characteristics on a personal level, afterwards in country classification, which provides a cultural comparison of the employee volunteerism. Our findings prove that demographical differences do not, but company-level actions influence the intensity of formal volunteerism. Moreover, three main clusters (formed from 43 countries) show different values. This diversity might partly be caused by measurement fragmentations and lack of internationally accepted definitions and theories. This paper aims to provide a broader overview of the topic, which might be a useful starting point for the forthcoming aggregated conceptualization. Employee volunteers’ behavior arises from the personal value of volunteerism. However, the attendance and intensity of voluntary activity are primarily influenced by the environment (e.g., life period, living and working situation). Employee volunteerism programs are an important and essential part of CSR at the company level, and strongly frames this activity, where employee volunteerism could associate each participant’s interests and improve their values. However, the practices may differ in each country and in each sector. The current pandemic rewrote the traditional volunteerism model and our projection. The last chapter provides a preliminary study about how employee volunteerism could work in this extraordinary, COVID-19 situation. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

This study made statistical analysis for the influences of the environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and air pollution, which may aid in spreading this virus very fast. The study also investigated statistically the impact of people customs such as smoking, drinking wine, and eating pig meat on the number of deaths among infected people. The study depicted reasons for spreading it in some places much more than others over the world. A statistical software SPSS was adopted to find a correlation among the different variables affecting the virus spread. The results exhibited a significant relationship between the suggested conditions and the virus spread. The study introduced two regression equations for expecting infected people and deaths based on the examined conditions for any region. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).

They play an important role in gene regulation through binding toa specific region in open reading frames (ORFs) and/or untranslated regions (UTRs) to block the translation processes through either degrading or blocking mRNA resulting in knocking down or suppression of targeted genes. Plants and many organisms protect themselves from viruses through the production of miRNAs, which are complementary to 3UTR of viruses resulting in degrading the viral mRNA or block the translation on ribosomes. As pandemic, COVID-19, and its consequences on the global economy, we hypothesized a new approach for the treatment of COVID-19 paints. This approach includes designing a mix of miRNAs targeting several regions on COVID-19 open reading frame (ORF) and 3 UTR and suitable delivery system targeting respiratory system tissues. These synthesized miRNAs may be delivered to humansinnon-viral delivery systems such as liposomes like exosome (extracellular vesicle), polymer-based carriers, or inorganic nanoparticles, which are considered to be more suitable for human use. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; miRNAs; Treatment; Virus microRNA; virus RNA; 3' untranslated region; coronavirus disease 2019; gene sequence; gene targeting; human; Letter; nonhuman; open reading frame; pandemic; progeny; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; virus genome Contextualizing the Covid-19 pandemic for a carbon-constrained world: Insights for sustainability transitions, energy justice, and research methodology The global Covid-19 pandemic has rapidly overwhelmed our societies, shocked the global economy and overburdened struggling health care systems and other social institutions around the world. While such impacts of Covid-19 are becoming clearer, the implications of the disease for energy and climate policy are more prosaic. This Special Section seeks to offer more clarity on the emerging connections between Covid-19 and energy supply and demand, energy governance, future low-carbon transitions, social justice, and even the practice of research methodology. It features articles that ask, and answer: What are the known and anticipated impacts of Covid-19 on energy demand and climate change? How has the disease shaped institutional responses and varying energy policy frameworks, especially in Africa? How will the disease impact ongoing social practices, innovations and sustainability transitions, including not only renewable energy but also mobility? How might the disease, and social responses to it, exacerbate underlying patterns of energy poverty, energy vulnerability, and energy injustice? Lastly, what challenges and insights does the pandemic offer for the practice of research, and for future research methodology? We find that without careful guidance and consideration, the brave new age wrought by Covid-19 could very well collapse in on itself with bloated stimulus packages that counter sustainability goals, misaligned incentives that exacerbate climate change, the entrenchment of unsustainable practices, and acute and troubling consequences for vulnerable groups. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Climate policy; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Energy governance; Energy policy; Sustainability transitions  Renyi entropy and mutual information measurement of market expectations and investor fear during the COVID-19 pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected world economies. In this regard, it is expected that information level and sharing between equity, digital currency, and energy markets has been altered due to the pandemic outbreak. Specifically, the resulting twisted risk among markets is presumed to rise during the abnormal state of world economy. The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, by using Renyi entropy, we analyze the multiscale entropy function in the return time series of Bitcoin, S&P500, WTI, Brent, Gas, Gold, Silver, and investor fear index represented by VIX. Second, by estimating mutual information, we analyze the information sharing between these markets. The analyses are conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical results from Renyi entropy indicate that for all market indices, randomness and disorder are more concentrated in less probable events. The empirical results from mutual information showed that the information sharing network between markets has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. From a managerial perspective, we conclude that during the pandemic (i) portfolios composed of Bitcoin and Silver, Bitcoin and WTI, Bitcoin and Gold, Bitcoin and Brent, or Bitcoin and S&P500 could be risky, (ii) diversification opportunities exist by investing in portfolios composed of Gas and Silver, Gold and Silver, Gold and Gas, Brent and Silver, Brent and Gold, or Bitcoin and Gas, and that (iii) the VIX exhibited the lowest level of information disorder at all scales before and during the pandemic. Thus, it seems that the pandemic has not influenced the expectations of investors. Our results provide an insight of the response of stocks, cryptocurrencies, energy, precious metal markets, to expectations of investors in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of information ordering and sharing. © 2020 Bitcoin; Brent; COVID-19 Pandemic; Gas; Gold; Mutual information; Renyi entropy; S&P500; Silver; VIX; WTI Bitcoin; Gold; Information analysis; Investments; Silver; Energy markets; Gold and silver; Information levels; Information sharing; Information sharing network; Market expectations; Multi-scale entropies; Mutual informations; Information dissemination COVID-ABS: An agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemic to simulate health and economic effects of social distancing interventions The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has directly impacted the public health and economy worldwide. To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 Agent-based simulation; COVID-19; Epidemic models; SEIR Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Diseases; Simulation platform; Viruses; Agent-based model; Input parameter; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Python programming language; Social cooperations; Social isolation; Society of agents; Vertical isolation; Economic and social effects Local response in health emergencies: key considerations for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in informal urban settlements This paper highlights the major challenges and considerations for addressing COVID-19 in informal settlements. It discusses what is known about vulnerabilities and how to support local protective action. There is heightened concern about informal urban settlements because of the combination of population density and inadequate access to water and sanitation, which makes standard advice about social distancing and washing hands implausible. There are further challenges to do with the lack of reliable data and the social, political and economic contexts in each setting that will influence vulnerability and possibilities for action. The potential health impacts of COVID-19 are immense in informal settlements, but if control measures are poorly executed these could also have severe negative impacts. Public health interventions must be balanced with social and economic interventions, especially in relation to the informal economy upon which many poor urban residents depend. Local residents, leaders and community-based groups must be engaged and resourced to develop locally appropriate control strategies, in partnership with local governments and authorities. Historically, informal settlements and their residents have been stigmatized, blamed, and subjected to rules and regulations that are unaffordable or unfeasible to adhere to. Responses to COVID-19 should not repeat these mistakes. Priorities for enabling effective control measures include: collaborating with local residents who have unsurpassed knowledge of relevant spatial and social infrastructures, strengthening coordination with local governments, and investing in improved data for monitoring the response in informal settlements. © 2020 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). community–state relations; coronavirus; COVID-19; epidemic response; health data; infectious disease; informal settlements; urban health COVID-19; epidemic; health impact; health risk; infectious disease; public health; viral disease; Coronavirus Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security and diet-related lifestyle behaviors: An analytical study of google trends-based query volumes The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 disease (COVID)-19 is having profound effects on the global economy and food trade. Limited data are available on how this pandemic is affecting our dietary and lifestyle-related behaviors at the global level. Google Trends was used to obtain worldwide relative search volumes (RSVs) covering a timeframe from before the COVID-19 pandemic 1 June 2019 to 27 April 2020. Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients were used to measure relationships between daily confirmed cases and aforementioned RSVs between 31 December 2019 and 15 April 2020. RSV curves showed increased interest in multiple keywords related to dietary and lifestyle behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown period in March and April 2020. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the strongest variables in each keyword category were (1) food security (food shortage: r = 0.749, food bank: r = 0.660, and free food: r = 0.555; all p < 0.001), (2) dietary behaviors (delivery: r = 0.780, restaurant: r = −0.731, take-away: r = 0.731, and food-delivery: r = 0.693; all p < 0.001), (3) outdoor-related behaviors (resort: r = −0.922, hotel: r = −0.913, cinema: r = −0.844, park: r = −0.827, fitness: r = −0.817, gym: r = −0.811; plant: r = 0.749, sunbathing: r = 0.668, and online: r = 0.670; all p < 0.001), and (4) immune-related nutrients/herbs/foods (vitamin C: r = 0.802, vitamin A: r = 0.780, zinc: r = 0.781, immune: r = 0.739, vitamin E: r = 0.707, garlic: r = 0.667, omega-3 fatty acid: r = −0.633, vitamin D: r = 0.549, and turmeric: r = 0.545; all p < 0.001). Restricted movement has affected peoples’ dietary and lifestyle behaviors as people tend to search for immune-boosting nutrients/herbs and have replaced outdoor activities with sedentary indoor behaviors. © 2020 by the authors.

As testing and tracing capacities increase, frameworks are needed to inform design and delivery to ensure their effective implementation and equitable distribution, and to strengthen community engagement in slowing and eventually stopping Covid-19 transmission. In this commentary, we highlight opportunities for integrating implementation research into planned and employed strategies in the United States to accelerate reach and effectiveness of interventions to more safely relax social distancing policies and open economies, schools, and other institutions. Implementation strategies, such as adapting evidence-based interventions based on contextual factors, promoting community engagement, and providing data audit and feedback on implementation outcomes, can support the translation of policies on testing, tracing, social distancing, and public mask use into reality. These data can demonstrate how interventions are put into practice and where adaptation in policy or practice is needed to respond to the needs of specific communities and socially vulnerable populations. Incorporating implementation research into Covid-19 policy design and translation into practice is urgently needed to mitigate the worsening health inequities in the pandemic toll and response. Applying rigorous implementation research frameworks and evaluation systems to the implementation of evidence-based interventions which are adapted to contextual factors can promote effective and equitable pandemic response and accelerate learning both among local stakeholders as well as between states to further inform their varied experiences and responses to the pandemic. © 2020 The Author(s).

Understanding current patterns of the pandemic spread and forecasting its long-term trajectory is essential in guiding policies aimed at curtailing the pandemic. This is particularly important in regions with weak economies and fragile health care systems such as West Africa. We formulate and use a deterministic compartmental model to (i) assess the current patterns of COVID-19 spread in West Africa, (ii) evaluate the impact of currently implemented control measures, and (iii) predict the future course of the pandemic with and without currently implemented and additional control measures in West Africa. An analytical expression for the threshold level of control measures (involving a reduction in the effective contact rate) required to curtail the pandemic is computed. Considering currently applied health control measures, numerical simulations of the model using baseline parameter values estimated from West African COVID-19 data project a 67% reduction in the daily number of cases when the epidemic attains its peak. More reduction in the number of cases will be achieved if additional public health control measures that result in a reduction in the effective contact rate are implemented. We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 46% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Additionally, disease elimination is possible if asymptomatic individuals are identified and isolated within 5 days (after the incubation period). Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic cases are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 8 days, only about 29% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination. Furthermore, we showed that the currently implemented measures triggered a 33% reduction in the time-dependent effective reproduction number between February 28 and June 26, 2020. We conclude that curtailing the COVID-19 pandemic burden significantly in West Africa requires more control measures than those that have already been implemented, as well as more mass testing and contact tracing in order to identify and isolate asymptomatic individuals early. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In the midst of this global public health crisis, a prompt review of the counterinsurgencies that have occurred in different jurisdictions is helpful. This article examines the experience of Hong Kong (HKSAR), which successfully limited its number of confirmed cases to approximately 1100 until early June 2020. Considering the limited actions that the government has taken against the pandemic, we emphasize the prominent role of Hong Kong's civil society through highlighting the strong and spontaneous mobilization of its local communities originating from their experiences during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the social unrest in 2019, as well as their doubts regarding the pandemic assessments and recommendations of the HKSAR and WHO authorities. This article suggests that the influence of civil society should not be overlooked in the context of pandemic management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Asia; civil society; COVID-19; Hong Kong; social mobilization  Mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among US adults without a pre-existing mental health condition: Findings from American trend panel survey Most individuals in the United States have no history of a mental health condition yet are at risk for psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19–24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances. This has important implications for mental health service delivery. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Several governments issued restrictions on inbound flights to mitigate such risk. But with the pandemic controlled in many countries, some decide to reopen the economy by relaxing the international air travel bans. As the virus has still been prevailing in many regions, this relaxation raises the alarm to import overseas cases and results in the revival of local pandemic. This study proposes a risk index to measure one country's imported case risk from inbound international flights. The index combines both daily dynamic international air connectivity data and the updated global COVID-19 data. It can measure the risk at the country, province and even specific route level. The proposed index was applied to China, which is the first country to experience and control COVID-19 pandemic while later becoming exposed to high imported case risk after the epidemic centers switched to Europe and the US afterward. The calculated risk indexes for each Chinese province or region show both spatial and temporal patterns from January to April 2020. It is found that China's strict restriction on inbound flights since March 26 was very effective to cut the imported case risk by half than doing nothing. But the overall index level kept rising because of the deteriorating pandemic conditions around the world. Hong Kong and Taiwan are the regions facing the highest imported case risk due to their superior international air connectivity and looser restriction on inbound flights. Shandong Province had the highest risk in February and early March due to its well-developed air connectivity with South Korea and Japan when the pandemic peaked in these two countries. Since mid-March, the imported case risk from Europe and the US dramatically increased. Last, we discuss policy implications for the relevant stakeholders to use our index to dynamically adjust the international air travel restrictions. This risk index can also be applied to other contexts and countries to relax restrictions on particular low-risk routes while still restricting the high-risk ones. This would balance the essential air travels need and the requirement to minimize the imported case risk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd China; COVID-19; Imported case risk; International air travel  Are we there yet? The transition from response to recovery for the COVID-19 pandemic There is no corner of the planet that has not been impacted by the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. While the COVID-19 pandemic has already had far-reaching socioeconomic consequences commonly associated with natural hazards (such as disruption to society, economic damage, and loss of lives), the response of governments around the world has been unparalleled and unlike anything seen before. Governments are faced with a myriad of multi-dimensional effects of the pandemic, including direct impacts on public health systems and population health and indirect socioeconomic effects including disruption to every single sector of the economy and mass unemployment. There is, additionally, the growing realisation that the timescale associated with this crisis may permanently change the very foundations of societies ‘normal’ day-to-day life. As the world transitions to recovering from COVID-19, those developing that recovery need support in adjusting and improving their policies and measures. The situation seems dire, the stakes are high. Literature about the transition between the response and recovery phase in relation to pandemics is scarce. Further complication is that the pandemic will not allow countries to simply transition to the full-scale recovery, instead, a rebound from recovery to response phase is expected for a certain period until the immunization is in place. Pandemics indeed force us to think beyond typical emergency management structures; the cycles of the disaster risk management in the case of biological and other natural hazards are not exactly the same and no one-size-fits-all approach may be used. Still, some parallels may be drawn with the efforts to combat natural hazards and some lessons may be used from previous and the current pandemic. Based on these experiences and reflections, this paper provides a set of policy directions to be considered during the transition towards, as well as throughout, this transition phase. It is suggested that meeting this global, multi-dimensional, and complex challenge will require considerable international collaboration (even convention) and macro-scale changes to global and national policies. The recovery issues are mainly going to be dominated by politics, economics and social science. Necessary for an effective recovery, the pandemic response needs to be a holistic response, combined with an improved data ecosystem between the public health system and the community. We should also view this outbreak and our response to it as an opportunity to learn lessons and reaffirm our universal commitment to sustainable development and enhancing wellbeing around the world. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Disaster response; Recovery; Transition  COVID-19 energy sector responses in Africa: A review of preliminary government interventions The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed unprecedented shocks across all facets of society, from strained healthcare systems to the closure of schools and economies. The energy sector is of no exception, with several concerns being raised about the ramifications that will arise for the clean energy transition. The goal of our study is to review how governments in Africa have responded to this challenge in the energy sector. We used an internet search to gather information from government policy statements/briefs, and websites of international organizations such as the IMF, WHO, KPMG, and the World Bank. Our review revealed that the majority of preliminary responses were short-term and include the provision of free electricity, waiver/suspension of bill payments, and VAT exemptions on electricity bills. These measures were more pronounced in sub-Sahara Africa while oil-rich countries of the North mostly have broad economic measures that target their oil and gas sectors. Economic stimulus packages prepared by most countries do not explicitly mention energy sector companies/institutions, especially the Renewable Energies (RE) sector. Only three countries (Nigeria, Kenya, and Burkina Faso) had specific interventions for renewables. Overall, interventions were mostly fiscal/financial and short-term, with medium to long term measures often broad without being specific to the energy sector. As governments take measures to bolster their economies, they must pay particular attention to the challenges posed by the pandemic in the energy sector and capitalize on the opportunities that it presents to drive the clean energy transition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Africa; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Energy; Energy policy; Energy transition  Rapid Scoping Review of Laparoscopic Surgery Guidelines During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Appraisal Using a Simple Quality Appraisal Tool “EMERGE” The theoretical danger of virus transmission during laparoscopic surgery (LS) via surgical smoke and laparoscopy gas has led to the formulation of many guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid scoping review of these guidelines was done to assess the quality of their evidence and appraise them for their impact on surgical services from the global south. A simple quality appraisal tool was constructed which can be used to evaluate rapidly emerging guidelines for evidence as well as for the needs of the global south. This rapid scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews protocol. Electronic databases were searched with predefined strategy and retrieved papers were screened according to relevant criteria. A simple objective tool to assess the quality of rapidly emerging guidelines including evidence, methodology, ease, resource optimization, geography, and the economy was constructed. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. None of the guidelines qualified to be evidence-based clinical practice guidelines as the level of evidence was uniformly rated “low”. A newly constructed tool showed good validation, reliability, and internal consistency. This rapid scoping review found two major research gaps: lack of systematic review of evidence during their development and insufficient weightage of their impact on surgical services from the global south. These significant issues were addressed by constructing a simple and more representative tool for evaluating rapidly emerging guidelines which also gives the rightful importance of their impact on surgical services from the global south. © 2020, Association of Surgeons of India.

The transition from a linear economy to a circular economy (CE) is now among the top priorities. This article discusses the implementation of the circular economy paradigm in Poland through the analysis of the existing and planned mechanisms, and actions taken by the Polish government which can be replicated by other young European countries. Further, the article discusses the direction of change and projected measures planned by the Polish government to improve the quality of municipal solid waste management. In this context, profitability analysis is carried out for two methods of waste processing (incineration and torrefaction) intended for small municipalities and settlements in which district heating and trading of generated electricity are not feasible. The results of the analysis shows that torrefaction is clearly a more desirable waste processing option as a step towards the implementation of CE for civic society in the urban context, as well as profitability, in comparison to incineration. The analysis accounts for several scenarios before the lockdown caused due to the COVID-19 pandemic and after it was lifted. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Valuing virtuous behaviour through the transfer and sharing of risks among several actors allows us to achieve benefits for all. The COVID-19 pandemic leads us to experiment with new forms of public health protection, including through insurance instruments. The role of insurance companies, intrinsically linked with the protection of primary areas such as healthcare and welfare, therefore becomes more critical than ever in terms of securing the protection of people, families, and productive activities. This work endorses the design of a virtuous cycle of investments, which may be implemented starting with insurance companies; such a project would unfold through insurance policies' contractual lines, securitisation schemes, investment policies, and socially responsible corporate strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants (N = 320; 54.7% male; mean age of 32 years) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period beginning within 1 month of the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. Results: The results of a theory-informed path model showed that having at least 1 child under the age of 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use, and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and greater coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from having children at home, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Conclusions: Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer term outcomes of drinking to cope during the pandemic. © 2020 by the Research Society on Alcoholism Coronavirus; Drinking Motives; Social Distancing; Solitary Drinking; Stress  A possible path towards rapid development of live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines: Plunging into the natural pool Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spreading around the world, causing massive distress to the world’s economy and affecting healthcare systems worldwide. Although some exposed individuals have no symptoms and most symptomatic infections are not severe, COVID-19 cases span a wide spectrum, ranging from mild to critical and sometimes resulting in life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia, severe respiratory distress and cardiac problems. Currently, there is no curative drug for COVID-19 and vaccines are still under development. We are presenting here a strategy for the fast development of natural live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Our proposed approach is based on screening for, identifying, analyzing and selecting naturally attenuated yet highly immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 strains, which may lead to a shorter cycle of vaccine development, as well as higher vaccine effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.

The highly contagious COVID-19 infection has affected millions of people to date and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Aside from the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of a treatment or vaccine has been the main reason for its spread. Thus, it has become necessary to find alternative methods for controlling SARS-CoV-2. For the present review, we conducted an online search for different available nutrition-based therapies for previously known coronavirus infections and RNA-based virus infections as well as general antiviral therapies. These treatments have promise for combating COVID-19, as various nutrients and minerals play direct and indirect roles in the control and prevention of this newly emerged viral infection. The patients’ nutritional status with COVID-19 must be analyzed before administering any treatment, and nutritional supplements should be given to the affected individuals along with routine treatment. We suggest a potential interventional role of nutrients to strengthen the immune system against the emerging infection caused by COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

While the sharing economy may contribute to addressing sustainability issues, its actual economic, social and environmental impacts remain poorly understood. Advancing more sustainably promising forms of sharing and leveraging its benefits, while circumventing its pitfalls, is becoming increasingly important in the era of Covid-19 and climate crisis, economic downturn and uncertainty, and loss of social connectedness, particularly in anonymous urban environments. The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Poland, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, thereby supplementing more frequently discussed perspectives from high-income countries. The volume also outlines the course for future research. © 2020 Business perspective; Sharing economy; Sustainability; Urban governance; User perspective Environmental impact; Business perspective; Developing economies; Empirical findings; Municipal government; Production and consumption; Social and environmental impact; Sustainability issues; Urban environments; Sustainable development Translation of genomic epidemiology of infectious pathogens: Enhancing African genomics hubs for outbreaks Background: Deadly emerging infectious pathogens pose an unprecedented challenge to health systems and economies, especially across Africa, where health care infrastructure is weak, and poverty rates remain high. Genomic technologies are vital for enhancing the understanding and development of intervention approaches against these pathogens, including Ebola and the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Discussion: Africa has contributed few genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to the global pool in growing open access repositories. To bridge this gap, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) is coordinating continent-wide initiatives to establish genomic hubs in selected well-resourced African centres of excellence. This will allow for standardisation and efficient and rapid data generation and curation. However, the strategy to ensure capacity for high-throughput genomics at selected hubs should not overshadow the deployment of portable, field-friendly and technically less demanding genomics technologies in all affected countries. This will enhance small-scale local genomic surveillance in outbreaks, leaving validation and large-scale approaches to be taken at central genomic hubs. Conclusion: The ACDC needs to scale-up its campaign for government support across African Union countries to ensure the sustainable financing of its strategy for increased pathogen genomic intelligence and other interventions in current and inevitable future epidemics in Africa. © 2020 The Authors ACDC; Africa; COVID-19; Genomic hubs; GISAID African; coronavirus disease 2019; disease control; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; Ebolavirus; epidemic; genomics; health care; human; infectious agent; medical research; poverty; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; Short Survey Capital and Climate in Times of Coronavirus: Reply to Critics In this essay, the authors of Climate Leviathan reply to their critics. © 2020 Association for Economic and Social Analysis.

Despite the great effort put in the development of vaccines and specific treatments, no prophylaxis or effective therapeutics are currently available. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and a potent vasodilator that has proved to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV replication and hypoxia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Given the potential of NO as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of NO on SARS-CoV-2 replication. The NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) had a dose dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, while the non S-nitrosated NAP was not active, as expected. Although the viral replication was not completely abolished (at 200 μM and 400 μM), SNAP delayed or completely prevented the development of viral cytopathic effect in treated cells, and the observed protective effect correlated with the level of inhibition of the viral replication. The capacity of the NO released from SNAP to covalently bind and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL recombinant protease in vitro was also tested. The observed reduction in SARS-CoV-2 protease activity was consistent with S-nitrosation of the enzyme active site cysteine. © 2020 The Author(s) 3CL protease; COVID-19; FRET; Nitric oxide; SARS-CoV-2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent; cysteine; n acetyl s nitrosopenicillamine; nitric oxide; proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; recombinant enzyme; antiviral activity; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytopathogenic effect; drug protein binding; enzyme active site; enzyme inhibition; in vitro study; nonhuman; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus replication Spatial agglomeration of manufacturing in the Wuhan metropolitan area: An analysis of sectoral patterns and determinants The important role of the entity economy, especially manufacturing, has been further highlighted after the outbreak of COVID-19. This study fills a research gap on manufacturing in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area by analyzing the spatio-temporal evolution patterns and characteristics of manufacturing, exploring the major location factors causing spatial reconstruction and comparing the effect intensities of the different factors in the manufacturing sector. From 2003 to 2018, the process of industrial suburbanization in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area continued to strengthen and currently the overall spatial pattern of manufacturing in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area is characterized by spreading in metropolitan areas and aggregation in industrial parks. The results of a spatial metering model showed that the dominant factors affecting the layout of manufacturing included innovation and technical service platforms, industrial parks, the number of large enterprises, living convenience, and air quality. However, the effect intensity of the different location factors varied among industries. The findings may help the government to understand the characteristics of agglomeration and spreading in the manufacturing industry and, in accordance with the dominant factors affecting the location of this industry, rationally develop ideas for adjusting the industrial layout in the post-coronavirus age. © 2020 by the authors.

As a working hypothesis, the authors propose that the Russian Federation, where the extraction and export of mineral raw materials are the basis of its social and economic growth, has led to numerous production imbalances. This not only lowers the quality and growth potential of Russia's future GDP but also undermines its macroeconomic stability and makes its national economy prone to oil shocks due to the dramatic global recession and lower demand for hydrocarbons. The paper builds a linear regression model to assess the dependence of Russia's GDP on oil exports from 1996 to 2019. Besides, the authors obtained statistically significant regression equations confirming the theoretical assertion that the dependence of the rates of socio-economic growth on the export of natural raw materials reduces the quality and efficiency of state and public institutions since those in power are trying to legislatively facilitate their access to resources, which, in turn, significantly reduces the potential for economic growth. The article confirms the need for a transition to a new (neo-industrial) socioeconomic paradigm since this will help overcome the production imbalance that has developed in the Russian economy, ensure long-term socio-economic growth, and increase its efficiency. Proposals are formulated for the formation of economic conditions for neo-industrial economic development, the basis of which should be innovativeness, environmental friendliness, and inclusiveness. © 2020 Lifescience Global Neo-industrial paradigm; Raw materials export model; Socio-economic growth; The Great Lockdown; Unprecedented global recession  An Android-based application for convenient visitation at windhoek correctional facility A global outbreak of Coronavirus affected countries' economy, people's lives and businesses around the world due to lockdown restrictions imposed on everyday activities. Like elsewhere, logistics and visiting hours to correctional facilities in Namibia is no exception. Namibian correctional facilities are far located in remote areas, hence, visitation to these facilities tends to be cumbersome, time-consuming, costly and at times disappointing due to the lack of accurate and timely information. Also, the rate of imprisonment quadrupled due to unfortunate acts during the lockdown. In response to this challenges, authors of this paper developed an android-based application to support social distancing, help Namibians in locating their relatives and friends in Namibian rehabilitation centers and reduce recidivism while improving the morale and safety of inmates and workers amid the pandemic. This study adopted a mixed research methodology with a case study and an experimental as a research design. An Agile software development model has been used for the development of an application. Primary data were collected through open-ended questionnaires, direct observations in the prison and group interviews. The study has been also chiefly informed by related literature reviews, as secondary data. A simple random sampling technique has been used to select the respondents from a target population of thirty participants. The study concluded that the application developed was intelligent, innovative, helpful, easy and convenient to use. Mobile technology can drastically change how we can communicate. It has been recommended that the Ministry of Home Affairs, Safety and Security consider funding and fully implement this project in all thirteen correctional facilities across the country. As part of future work, a similar version of iOS is to be developed and possibly implement a remote and/or onsite Inmate video visitation. © 2020 ACM. coronavirus (COVID-19); facilities; inmates; recidivism; visitors Android (operating system); Software design; Surveys; Agile software development; Direct observations; Literature reviews; Mobile Technology; Open-ended questionnaire; Research methodologies; Safety and securities; Simple random sampling; Application programs Clinical management of lung cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic The rapid growth of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the early December 2019. COVID-19 spread all over the word just a few months. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection poses major threat to international health and economy. World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus was an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020. However, with the spread of COVID-19, the routine medical care of lung cancer patients was affected. Because lung cancer patients have low immunity after anti-tumor treatment, they should become the main targets for epidemic prevention. Lung cancer patients are increasingly concerned about the prevention of COVID-19. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management for lung cancer patients based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns. © 2020 The Author(s).

In light of the strategic goals of the Qatar National Vision 2030, which is to diversify Qatar’s economy and minimize its reliance on hydrocarbon industries, if these ambitious goals are to be achieved, there is a necessity to maintain the local cultural identity, demonstrated through architecture and urbanism. Design/methodology/approach: This study is an exploratory research based on qualitative methods of data gathering and investigation. The local communities who used to live in the scattered old villages were approached with surveys. At the same time, semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals in the field in Qatar and other individuals from the public, depending on their literacy levels. Findings: This paper examines how to revive those villages and improve their current economic level. Finally, the study proposes some recommendations for these abandoned villages in an attempt to rejuvenate their built heritage and revitalize their socioeconomic status. Originality/value: Economic diversification needs to be engendered through the services and products of Qatari society; this is possible by exploiting current resources such as the built heritage or historic sites in areas outside the emerging metropolitan cities. This study reveals the great potential of regenerating the old villages of the Gulf States by establishing nonprofit organizations and increasing the economic benefit of the abandoned historic structures. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology — WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology — one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations. © 2020 Covid-19; Epidemiology; Pandemic; SARSCoV-2; Sewage; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) Diagnosis; Food supply; Network security; Public health; Sewage; Chemical signatures; Clinical diagnostics; Diagnostic testing; Environmental scientists; Financial institution; Large-scale applications; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Therapeutic treatments; Diseases; COVID-19; epidemic; epidemiology; future prospect; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage; viral disease; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease surveillance; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; epidemiological monitoring; human; international cooperation; mass screening; medical research; nonhuman; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; public health; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; waste water; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; virology; virus pneumonia; waste water; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Waste Water Risk Perceptions and Psychological Effects During the Italian COVID-19 Emergency The current study provides data about the immediate risk perceptions and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among Italian participants. A sample of 980 volunteers answered a web-based survey which aimed to investigate the many facets of risk perceptions connected to COVID-19 (health, work, institutional-economy, interpersonal and psychological), and risk-related variables such as perceived knowledge, news seeking, perceived control, perceived efficacy of containment measures, and affective states. Socio-demographic characteristics were also collected. Results showed that although levels of general concern are relatively high among Italians, risk perceptions are highest with regards to the institutional-economy and work, and lowest concerning health. COVID-19 has been also estimated to be the least likely cause of death. Cognitive and affective risk-related variables contributed to explain the several risk perception domains differently. COVID-19 perceived knowledge did not affect any risk perception while the perceived control decreased health risk likelihood. The other risk-related variables amplified risk perceptions: News seeking increased work and institutional-economy risk; perceived efficacy of containment measures increased almost all perceived risks; negative affective states of fear, anger and sadness increased health risk; anxiety increased health, interpersonal and psychological risks, and uncertainty increased work, institutional-economy, interpersonal and psychological risk perceptions. Finally, positive affective states increased health risk perception. Socio-psychological implications are discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Lanciano, Graziano, Curci, Costadura and Monaco.

The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs. © Copyright © 2020 Beeraka, Sadhu, Madhunapantula, Rao Pragada, Svistunov, Nikolenko, Mikhaleva and Aliev.

A cross-sectional study using a web-based approach was conducted in the second week of April 2020 to examine the influence of the national social distancing on the quality of life and economic well-being of Vietnamese citizens under COVID-19 pandemic. The data included socio-economic characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on household income, health status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Ordered logistic regression and multivariable Tobit regression model were employed to examine factors correlated to income change and HRQOL. Results showed that among 341 participants, 66.9% reported household income loss due to the impact of COVID-19. People holding undergraduate degrees, working in other sectors rather than healthcare, and having definite-term contract had a higher likelihood of income reduction. The mean score of EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS was 0.95 (± 0.07) and 88.2 (± 11.0), respectively. The domain of Anxiety/Depression had the highest proportion of reporting any problems among 5 dimensions of EQ-5D-5L (38.7%). Being female, having chronic conditions and living in the family with 3–5 members were associated with lower HRQOL scores. A comprehensive assessment of the influence of COVID-19 along with public health interventions, especially mental health programs, should be implemented to mitigate the negative effects of this pandemic on the economic status and quality of life of citizens. © Copyright © 2020 Tran, Nguyen, Le, Latkin, Pham, Vu, Le, Nguyen, Pham, Ta, Nguyen, Ho and Ho. COVID-19; economic well-being; household income; HRQOL; quality of life; social distancing  A preliminary study on exploring the critical success factors for developing COVID-19 preventive strategy with an economy centric approach Purpose: In the wake of COVID-19, most of the countries at present, are in a dilemma whether to extend lockdown at the cost of economy or to improve the hard-hit economy by lifting the lockdown. It is indicated by the reputed organizations and medical fraternity that corona will stay here for a longer period contrary to the earlier assumptions. Hence the purpose of this study is to suggest a strategy which balances both preventive measures and economic losses to control the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: There is a need for the identification of the critical success factors (CSFs) for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies to control the pandemic with an economy-centric approach. Findings: The six CSFs identified are “Effective communication”, “Social distancing”, “Adopting new technology”, “Modify the rules and regulation at workplace”, “Sealing the borders of the territory” and “Strong leadership and government control”. Research limitations/implications: The study has a vital contribution to literature as no previous study has identified CSFs for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies while focusing on the economy. Practical implications: Further, these identified CSFs are helpful in medium and longer-term planning which is required to rebalance and re-energize the economy following this epidemic crisis. Originality/value: The study has given a model that depicts the cause and influence relationship between the key factors in the system under question. The importance of study increases many fold, as resources are limited and the outcome of the study could be used to channelize the resources effectively. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

In the process of fighting against the epidemic in China, the clinical value of a variety of herbal medicines has been recognized and written into the clinical application guide. However, their effective molecular mechanism and potential targets are still not clear. Pathology and pharmacology research will gradually attract attention in the post-epidemic outbreak term. Here, we constructed a COVID-19 protein microarray of potential therapy targets, which contains the main drug targets to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the anti-virus, anti-inflammatory cellar targets of the host. Series of quality controls test has been carried out, which showed that it could be applied for drug target screening of bio-active natural products. The establishment of this microarray will provide a useful tool for the study of the molecular pharmacology of natural products. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: We collected the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 30 provinces and cities in China by the end of 24:00 February 25, 2020. Then we also collected the distance from each region to Hubei province, the proportion of population moving out from Wuhan city from January 1 to January 23, population density, urban population, traffic passenger volume, passenger turnover volume and other relevant data of each region.The cumulative confirmed cases including the most of imported cases by the end of 24:00 January 29, 2020 were taken as the first-stage cases cluster, and the cumulative newly confirmed cases including the most of secondary cases from 0:00 January 30 to 24:00 February 25, 2020 were taken as the second-stage cases cluster. Pearson bivariate correlation and linear fitting regression method were adopted to analyze the effects of population migration, transportation, economy and other factors on the transmission and development of COVID-19 in different regions. In the linear fitting regression, the multi-factor optimal subset model was used to screen the factors most closely related to COVID-19. Results: The distance from each region to Hubei province was negatively correlated with the first-stage cases cluster with the most of imported cases and the second-stage cases cluster with the most of secondary cases(t=-3.654, t=-3.679, both P<0.05). The proportion of population moving out from Wuhan, GDP, urban population, traffic passenger volume, and passenger turnover volume were positively correlated with the first-stage and second-stage cases cluster (all t>2.760, all P<0.05). GDP and the proportion of population moving out from Wuhan were most closely related to the first-stage cases cluster with the most of imported cases (t=4.173, t=7.851, all P<0.05). The first-stage cases cluster, the proportion of population moving out from Wuhan, and urban population were most closely related to the second-stage cases cluster with the most of secondary cases (t=4.734, t=3.491, t=2.855, all P<0.05). Results: GDP and the proportion of population moving out from Wuhan city had the greatest impact on the stage with the most of imported cases. The imported cases, the proportion of population moving out from Wuhan and the urban population had the greatest impact on the stage with the most of secondary cases. In the early stage of epidemic outbreak with the most of imported cases,we should consider strengthening the prevention and control of the epidemic in areas with high level of GDP and high proportion of population moving out from the epidemic area.The flow of population should be restricted more strictly as soon as possible in order to effectively curb the outbreak of the epidemic.In the later-stage of epidemic with the most of secondary cases, regionalized control policies should be formulated mainly according to the indicators of imported cases, the population proportion fromtheepidemic area, and the urban population. Finally, the contact of population should be restricted reasonably to prevent further development of the epidemic. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University (Medical Sciences).

Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines against future pathogens. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Sartorius, D’Apice, Manco and De Berardinis. antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19; emerging infectious diseases; epidemics; pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; vaccines; viruses bacterial vaccine; CD47 antigen; DNA vaccine; hemagglutinin; hepatitis B surface antigen; live vaccine; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; subunit vaccine; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; inactivated vaccine; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody response; avian influenza (H5N1); cross reaction; cytokine production; dendritic cell; dengue; Dengue virus; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; gene expression; health care personnel; hepatitis E; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; innate immunity; Lassa fever; liver injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Review; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; SARS coronavirus; vaccination; virus infection; virus neutralization; virus particle; West Nile fever; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vaccines, DNA; Vaccines, Inactivated; Vaccines, Subunit; Viral Vaccines Coronavirus RNA Proofreading: Molecular Basis and Therapeutic Targeting The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is wreaking havoc on worldwide public health and economies has heightened awareness about the lack of effective antiviral treatments for human coronaviruses (CoVs). Many current antivirals, notably nucleoside analogs (NAs), exert their effect by incorporation into viral genomes and subsequent disruption of viral replication and fidelity. The development of anti-CoV drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to proofread and remove mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and transcription. Here, we review the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading complex and evaluate its potential as a drug target. We also consider existing nucleoside analogs and novel genomic techniques as potential anti-CoV therapeutics that could be used individually or in combination to target the proofreading mechanism. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Robson et al. examine the molecular basis of the coronavirus proofreading mechanism and how this contributes to the resistance of this family of viruses to nucleoside analog (NA) antiviral drugs.

For this purpose, daily stock market returns were used over the period of December 31, 2019–April 20, 2020 for the following economies: USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, China, and Romania. The study applied the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to explore whether the Romanian stock market is impacted by the crisis generated by novel coronavirus. Granger causality was employed to investigate the causalities among COVID-19 and stock market returns, as well as between pandemic measures and several commodities. The outcomes of the ARDL approach failed to find evidence towards the impact of Chinese COVID-19 records on the Romanian financial market, neither in the short-term, nor in the long-term. On the other hand, our quantitative approach reveals a negative effect of the new deaths’ cases from Italy on the 10-year Romanian bond yield both in the short-run and long-run. The econometric research provide evidence that Romanian 10-year government bond is more sensitive to the news related to COVID-19 than the index of the Bucharest Stock Exchange.

It has had a devastating effect around the world, not only for public health, but also for the economy, labor market, and other facets of individual and societal life. Health systems have been put under high strain, and health professionals have experienced unusual and stressful work circumstances. With the aim of drawing lessons for nursing education, the present study analyzed, during the weeks of peak infection in Spain, the stress experience and coping strategies of a sample of 403 nurses from the Spanish health system. Specifically, we analyzed how tenure, stress appraisal, problem-focused coping, and support-seeking coping predicted nurses’ awareness of their education needs, both in terms of technical-professional knowledge and skills and transversal skills. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that more tenure (years of experience) was related to lower stress appraisal (workload, −0.12, p < 0.05; insufficient preparation, −0.33, p < 0.001; and fear of contagion −0.36, p < 0.001) and more problem focused coping (PFC) strategies were related to higher awareness of professional (0.18, p < 0.01) and transversal educational needs (0.17, p < 0.01) while support seeking strategies just related to transversal training needs (0.10, p < 0.05). Moreover, the participants provided valuable input about specific contents to be considered in future nursing education programs. Implications for redesigning the nursing degree curriculum are analyzed in the discussion section. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Yet, with two important international legal cases underway at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court there are now important opportunities to maintain pressure on Myanmar’s government. Myanmar’s current government–a fusion of militarist, democratic, ethno-nationalist and conservative interests–has consistently sought to downplay the seriousness of the situation. This attitude, and the fraught, but politically effective, nexus between Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) and the military, has done much to encourage a culture of impunity among military and civilian decision-makers. Nevertheless, with crucial national elections scheduled for November 2020, and an economy battered by the global COVID-19 shutdown, Myanmar faces a confluence of grave challenges. Under these conditions, key decision-makers in Naypyitaw may hope that international scrutiny of violence against the Rohingya will fade. Given these court actions, however, this is unlikely. Whatever sympathy we may have for Aung San Suu Kyi’s predicament, she will not recover her reputation. And she will forever face hard questions about her inability to prevent, and, more importantly, refusal to condemn, ethnic cleansing. © 2020 Australian Institute of International Affairs. accountability; Aung San Suu Kyi; genocide; International Court of Justice; Myanmar; Rohingya accountability; culture; ethnic cleansing; ethnic group; genocide; Myanmar A predictive model for assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economies of some Eastern European Countries The paper seeks to develop a predictive model for assessing the impact of the (COVID-19) pandemic on the economies of Eastern Europe, taking into account quarantine measures. Functions of the dependence on the number of the infected populations in Eastern Europe on pandemic duration were calculated based on trend analysis. Factors affecting the intensity of disease and the number of infected persons have been determined. Integral model of their influence has been built using regression analysis. Based on the values of the factors, the number of infected people and the rate of infection were predicted for each of the Eastern European countries. The prognostic duration of the stage of exponential disease growth and the total duration of quarantine (epidemiological saturation point) are substantiated. The predicted decline in Eastern European GDP due to COVID-19 has been estimated based on the construction of a prognostic regression model. The results obtained can be used by state authorities and economic agents as a tool for active and preventive response. They can also serve as an example of the urgent need to develop, especially in non-standard situations, mechanisms and products of open innovation. © 2020 by the authors.

We need to be honest about the scale of the obstacles ahead and realise that the health challenges and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are potentially devastating. We must also prepare to make difficult ethical decisions about restarting elective hip and knee arthroplasty. These decisions should be based on the existing evidence-base, reliable data, the recommendations of experts, and regional circumstances. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus 2; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19; economic; ethical challenge; healthcare; orthopaedic; revision arthroplasty; SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome; total hip arthroplasty; total knee arthroplasty Austria; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; economic aspect; Editorial; elective surgery; Greece; health care personnel; hip arthroplasty; hip replacement; hospitalization; human; intensive care unit; Italy; knee arthroplasty; length of stay; Netherlands; patient safety; perioperative period; periprosthetic fracture; postoperative care; prevalence; quality of life; risk factor; Spain; thromboembolism; Turkey (republic); United Kingdom; virus transmission; wellbeing; wound drainage; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care delivery; hip replacement; knee replacement; pandemic; patient selection; virus pneumonia; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Selection; Pneumonia, Viral Covid-19 and indian commerce: an analysis of fast moving consumer goods (Fmcg), and retail industries of tomorrow Introduction: This paper examines the effect of COVID-19 on Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) and Retail industries of India and examines emerging trends in these markets. Background: COVID-19 has impacted our lives from all the fronts. Businesses and Global Commerce will never be the same once the world restarts post COVID-19. Multiple new trends like Direct to Consumer model(D2C), Omnichannel fulfilment, etc. would emerge in the industries of tomorrow. Macroeconomic Dynamics, consumer behaviour and supply-side disruptions form a complex network that drives these trends in the economy. This network has to be studied to proactively identify the emerging trends in the industry. Methods: Existing literature on COVID-19 and its effect on business and commerce in India were retrieved through secondary research. The retrieved literature was analyzed to identify emerging trends. Conclusion: Emerging trends in FMCG and Retail industry suggest that the previously existing layers of wholesalers, distribu-tors, etc. between the producer and the end consumer is being eliminated. Companies are leveraging technology to achieve direct distribution and thus, are getting closer to the customer. © 2020 Global Research Online. All rights reserved.

In comparison to other countries, New Zealand has had a very low number of confirmed and probable cases as well as COVID-19-related deaths. New Zealand closed its borders and rapidly declared a stringent lockdown to eliminate COVID-19. The country's 'go hard, go early' policy serves as an exemplar for the rest of the world to date. The mysterious nature of COVID-19 has caused tremendous stress and uncertainty leading to universal conflict between public health and state economy. Mental health services and non-government organisations have been proactive in the fight against COVID-19. Though there has been no significant rise in referrals to secondary mental health services to date (4 May 2020), a rapid surge in mental health presentations is widely anticipated. Telehealth may prove to be an efficient and cost-effective tool for the provision of future health services. © The Author(s), 2020.

It then summarizes the unique “lessons learned” from the Covid-19 crisis by baselining actual developments against a reasonable, pre-Covid-19 pandemic scenario based on the 2002 SARS epidemic and 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Actual developments support the pre-Covid-19 hypothesis that financial market developments dominate claims losses due to the demographics of pandemics and other factors. However, Covid-19 “surprised” relative to the pre-Covid-19 scenario in terms of its impact on the real economy as well as on the property and casualty segment as business interruption property triggers and exclusions are challenged, something that may adversely impact the insurability of pandemics as well as the perception of the industry for some time to come. The unique lessons of Covid-19 reinforce the need for resilience upfront in solvency and liquidity, the need to improve business interruption wordings and re-underwrite the book, and the recognition that business interruption caused by pandemics may not be an insurable risk due to its large accumulation potential and the threat of external moral hazard. These insurability limitations lead to a discussion about the structure and financing of protection against the impact of future pandemics. © 2020, The Author(s).

Swenson. Lower incidence of COVID-19 at high altitude: Facts and confounders. High Alt Med Biol. 21:217-222, 2020. - The rapid transmission, increased morbidity, and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exhausted many health care systems and the global economy. Large variations in COVID-19 prevalence and incidence have been reported across and within many countries worldwide; however, this remains poorly understood. The variability and susceptibility across the world have been mainly attributed to differing socioeconomic status, burden of chronic diseases, access to health care, strength of health care systems, and early or late adoption of control measures. Environmental factors such as pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns at different latitudes may influence how severe the pandemic is and the incidence of infection in any part of the world. In addition, recent epidemiological data have been used to propose that altitude of residence may not only influence those environmental features considered key to lesser viral transmission, but also susceptibility to more severe forms of COVID-19 through hypoxic-hypobaria driven genomic or nongenomic adaptations specific to high-altitude populations. In this review, we critically examine these factors and attempt to determine based upon available scientific and epidemiological data whether living in high-altitude regions might be protective against COVID-19 as recent publications have claimed. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

It emphasises that the cumulative nature of the impact of these two crises forces shifts in interest positions of important political actors (countries, sectors, social constituencies) to address issues of ‘systemic instability’ which pushes innovations in the policy instruments that become available at the EU level. Bargaining processes that characterise the negotiations and outcomes of these crisis responses are complex, they reflect differences in size and urgencies to come to agreements, and they have themselves differentiating impacts on relevant political actors. © 2020, Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.

This pandemic has affected physical health as well as mental health adversely. Several recent evidence suggests that health systems across the world have to improve their preparedness in context to infectious pandemics. The research on mental health aspects of COVID-19 and other related pandemics is lacking due to obvious reasons. This narrative review article, along with our personal views, is on various current and future mental health issues in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on various challenges and suggested solutions. The aim is also to update mental health strategies in the context of such rapidly spreading contagious illness, which can act as a resource for such a situation, currently and in future. We recommend that there is a need to facilitate mental health research to understand the psychiatric aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, include psychiatrists in the task force, and make available psychotropic and other medications with special attention to the deprived sector of the society. © 2020 Indian Journal of Psychiatry Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

While, healthcare systems are globally operating at maximum capacity, healthcare workers and especially anesthesia providers are facing extreme pressures, something that is also leading to declining availability and increasing stress. In this regard, it is extremely concerning the fact that some regions worldwide have reported up to 20% of their cases to be healthcare workers. When considering that the global case fatality rate may be as much as 5.4%, these numbers are concerning and unacceptable. As this pandemic accelerates, access to personal protective equipment for health workers is a key concern since at present, healthcare workers are every country's most valuable resource in the fight against COVID-19. Governments and heath organizations should take care of their staff and support them in any way possible. This review aims to describe the current situation anesthesia providers are facing in the setting of COVID-19 and provide solutions and evidence on important concerns, including which guidance to follow, the level of equipment that is adequate, and the level of protection they need for every patient being administered an anesthetic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd anesthesiologist; COVID-19; critical care; nurse anesthetist; personal protective equipment anesthesia; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; health care; health care personnel; human; information dissemination; medical staff; mortality; priority journal; recovery room; Review; surgery; systematic review; virus load; virus transmission; anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care personnel; pandemic; procedures; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral Fluctuations in Hong Kong hotel industry room rates under the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: Evidence from big data on OTA channels The infectious pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly worldwide, crippling the global tourism industry's development and operations. In Hong Kong, where tourism is a pillar industry, the hotel industry is essential to maintaining a stable economy. Facing multiple forms of pressure, the industry's status deserves close attention. More than 200 hotels in Hong Kong were taken as the research set in this study. A Python-based web crawler was used to collect daily hotel prices from various online travel agencies. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis, and descriptive analysis were employed to study hotels' room rate fluctuations over time. Results indicated that room rates across hotels in Hong Kong were primarily influenced by holidays and festivities prior to COVID-19, whereas rates tended to decline after the outbreak. Data analysis based on hotels' star ratings revealed that 5-star hotels were relatively less affected by COVID-19 while 4- and 4.5-star hotels were most seriously affected. District-level analysis also showed that hotel room rates were differentially influenced by the virus: Hong Kong's Islands district was hit hardest, followed by Kowloon. These findings offer valuable implications for hotel managers and relevant government departments in making rational decisions based on the current market state. © 2020 by the authors.

Measures are classified according to (i) the path a given measure takes to affect the financial system, spending, production, and so forth, i.e., provide liquidity, encourage credit creation by the financial sector, or directly fund households; and (ii) the effects on the financial statements of households, businesses, government, i.e., whether the measures create more debt or more income. This gives a total of nine categories. When the information is available, we report the amounts that governments have announced (intentions) they will allocate to each measure (in many cases, no amount is provided because the measure does not entail spending, e.g., interest rate reductions). These are a mix of actual amounts and estimates, today and in the future (without specifying when). The database will be updated, revised, and expanded as information is released.

In order to achieve such a goal, the first part of the article presents the definition of energy poverty and the nature of its measures, as well as the determinants and policies of the state addressing the issue of energy poverty mitigation. In the second part of the paper, the results of research into the level of energy poverty are analyzed and the variables affecting energy poverty in Poland during the pandemic are determined. It was established on the basis of these results that the present pandemic contributed to the aggravation of financial difficulties in Polish households with regard to financing expenditure on energy carriers. It was found that COVID-19 had a negative impact on the average disposable income of Polish households, which, with the increase in prices and expenditure on energy carriers, led to an increase in the proportion of disposable income spent on energy carriers. The most affected have been the poorest households. Moreover, the long downward trend in the level of energy poverty in Poland has reversed. Thus, it has been proved that COVID-19 has contributed to the intensification of energy poverty in Poland. The theoretical and empirical considerations contained in this paper may be a valuable source of scientific data on the impact of the pandemic on household energy poverty, while public institutions may find them a source of useful information, helping to create effective instruments to mitigate energy poverty in the Polish economy. © 2020 by the authors.

We use this model to determine the long-run effect of a 1% increase in economic activity in any chosen sector on aggregate employment. Our findings point to manufacturing and construction sectors as those that generate the largest positive spillovers for the aggregate economy. Moreover, we provide an interactive web-based app that produces our model's forecasts based on any user-specified scenario.

There is much pressure to develop both preventative and curative therapies for SARS-CoV-2 as there is no evidence to support therapies to improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Medications that inhibit certain steps of virus life cycle that are currently used to treat other illnesses such as Malaria, Ebola, HIV and Hepatitis C are being studied for use against SARS-CoV-2. To date, data is limited for medications that facilitate clinical improvement of COVID-19 infections. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd 2019-nCoV; acetazolamide; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); autoimmune; camostat mesylate; chloroquine; COVID-19; high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE); hydroxychloroquine; Lopinavir/Ritonavir; novel coronavirus 2019; pandemic; Remdesivir; RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors; SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV); SARS CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); Umifenovir adenosine phosphate; alanine; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antivirus agent; camostat; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; gabexate; hydroxychloroquine; indole derivative; lopinavir; lopinavir-ritonavir drug combination; monoclonal antibody; remdesivir; ritonavir; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; tocilizumab; umifenovir; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; drug combination; drug effect; drug repositioning; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; immunology; pandemic; pathogenicity; virology; virus pneumonia; Adenosine Monophosphate; Alanine; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Drug Combinations; Drug Repositioning; Gabexate; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Indoles; Lopinavir; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Ritonavir; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus Covid-19: Mechanisms of vaccination and immunity Vaccines are needed to protect from SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19. Vaccines that induce large quantities of high affinity virus-neutralizing antibodies may optimally prevent infection and avoid unfavorable effects. Vaccination trials require precise clinical management, complemented with detailed evaluation of safety and immune responses. Here, we review the pros and cons of available vaccine platforms and options to accelerate vaccine development towards the safe immunization of the world’s population against SARS-CoV-2. Favorable vaccines, used in well-designed vaccination strategies, may be critical for limiting harm and promoting trust and a long-term return to normal public life and economy. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is being used widely to detect COVID-19 from various types of biological specimens, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and may not be rapidly deployable in remote or resource-limited settings. This might lead to hindrance in acquiring realistic data of infectivity and community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. This review summarizes the existing status of current diagnostic methods, their possible limitations, and the advantages of biosensor-based diagnostics over the conventional ones for the detection of SARS-Cov-2. Novel biosensors used to detect RNA-viruses include CRISPR-Cas9 based paper strip, nucleic-acid based, aptamer-based, antigen-Au/Ag nanoparticles-based electrochemical biosensor, optical biosensor, and Surface Plasmon Resonance. These could be effective tools for rapid, authentic, portable, and more promising diagnosis in the current pandemic that has affected the world economies and humanity. Present challenges and future perspectives of developing robust biosensors devices for rapid, scalable, and sensitive detection and management of COVID-19 are presented in light of the test-test-test theme of the World Health Organization (WHO). © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

Major research operations that are unrelated to COVID-19 have been significantly diminished or suspended entirely because of either COVID-19-related legal restrictions or logistical, staffing or operational concerns. Billions of people globally are currently affected by lockdowns or curfews. Since the timescale of such restrictive measures is unknown and subject to change, many studies are now in limbo and the welfare of tens of thousands of study participants is at risk. These circumstances have introduced complex ethical challenges that merit urgent attention from international sponsors, researchers and regulators. Certain sponsors and regulators have published guidelines on how the COVID-19-related disruptions to clinical research should be managed. Although these guidelines provide a good starting point in navigating the challenges of the evolving pandemic, they only apply to those researchers funded or governed by these bodies. Here, we provide guidelines on managing such disruptions that apply beyond these specific settings. We highlight some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on other ongoing research projects that are unrelated to COVID-19 and provide practical guidance on how the welfare of affected study participants should be managed. We conclude that policy-makers, sponsors, researchers and regulators must adopt a more flexible approach to ensure participant safety, while maintaining data integrity and complying with good clinical practices. © 2020, World Health Organization.

Our results, using both GARCH (1,1) and VAR specifications, suggest that such events are directly affecting the dry bulk and the dirty tanker segments. In addition, the results also suggest that second round effects, mostly via the decline in oil prices and, in some cases, third round effects via the impact from the stock market, also exist. Finally, by employing daily port calls a proxy variable for the demand for transportation services, we show that both the dry bulk and clean tankers are highly affected by the demand side of the economy, while vessels which transport crude oil do not register such a relationship. © 2020 The Authors Covid-19; Freight rates; Shipping markets  Air quality implications of COVID-19 in California The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected human health and the economy. The implementation of social distancing practices to combat the virus spread, however, has led to a notable improvement in air quality. This study compared the surface air quality monitoring data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA)'s AirNow network during the period 20 March-5 May in 2020 to those in 2015-2019 from the Air Quality System (AQS) network over the state of California. The results indicated changes in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of-2.04 ± 1.57 μg m-3 and ozone of-3.07 ± 2.86 ppb. If the air quality improvements persist over a year, it could potentially lead to 3970-8900 prevented premature deaths annually (note: the estimates of prevented premature deaths have large uncertainties). Public transit demand showed dramatic declines (~80%). The pandemic provides an opportunity to exhibit how substantially human behavior could impact on air quality. To address both the pandemic and climate change issues, better strategies are needed to affect behavior, such as ensuring safer shared mobility, the higher adoption of telecommuting, automation in the freight sector, and cleaner energy transition. © 2020 by the authors.

This crisis affects people in their most important, committed, and intimate relationships. Although this crisis has damaged the health and well-being of individuals, crushed economies, and led to an extensive period of uncertainty about the future, there may also be positive outcomes in the motivation people have to protect their relationships. In this paper, we focus on strategies that therapists and relationship educators can use to help couples preserve and protect their relationships during such a time. We describe four foundations of safety that allow relationships to thrive: physical, emotional, commitment, and community. We then highlight three keys from our body of work that can help guide individuals and couples in protecting their relationships on a day-to-day and moment-to-moment basis: (1) decide, don’t slide; (2) make it safe to connect; (3) do your part. © 2020 The Authors.

We discuss the effect of nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020. We also predict a 7 to 21% increase in the peak value of active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd  Public health; Control strategies; Global threats; Peak values; Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered; Wuhan , China; Health risks Is COVID-19 the end of US hegemony? Public bads, leadership failures and monetary hegemony COVID-19 is the most invasive global crisis in the postwar era, jeopardizing all dimensions of human activity. By theorizing COVID-19 as a public bad, I shed light on one of the great debates of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries regarding the relationship between the United States and liberal international order (LIO). Conceptualizing the pandemic as a public bad, I analyze its consequences for US hegemony. Unlike other international public bads and many of the most important public goods that make up the LIO, the COVID-19 public bad not only has some degree of rivalry but can be made partially excludable, transforming it into more of a club good. Domestically, I demonstrate how the failure to effectively manage the COVID-19 public bad has compromised America's ability to secure the health of its citizens and the domestic economy, the very foundations for its international leadership. These failures jeopardize US provision of other global public goods. Internationally, I show how the US has already used the crisis strategically to reinforce its opposition to free international movement while abandoning the primary international institution tasked with fighting the public bad, the World Health Organization (WHO). While the only area where the United States has exercised leadership is in the monetary sphere, I argue this feat is more consequential for maintaining hegemony. However, even monetary hegemony could be at risk if the pandemic continues to be mismanaged. © The Author(s) 2020.   The impact of COVID-19 on franchising in emerging markets: An example from Brazil The outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had significant economic, political, and social consequences worldwide. The franchising sector, consisting mostly of retail and service businesses, is an example of an industry that has been deeply affected. The experiences of franchising stakeholders in Brazil highlight the strengths of the franchising model in such situations. This investigation, based on primary data from webinars with food service, education, retail, and business-to-business service companies in Brazil, coupled with reports from commercial and franchising entities, reveals how the COVID-19 outbreak has affected the franchising sector. It illustrates the measures that were taken, the negotiations that take place between suppliers and landlords, the adaptation of business models, the effects on franchisor-franchisee relationships, and the impact the pandemic has had on relationships with customers. The strategies adopted by Brazilian franchisors and franchisees suggest lessons for other franchising companies in similar situations, such as those in developing and emerging economies. © 2020 The Authors.

A property oriented pandemic surviving trading model The COVID-19 pandemic produced adverse effects on the global economy. The devastating impact of COVID-19 or coronavirus on the prices of commodities such as oil and gas as well as foreign exchange (Forex) trading systems and currency pairs across the nations, resulted in the collapse of businesses and shutdown of the economy. It was also accompanied with great loss of fund for investors in stock and Forex due to the consequent failure of some stock and forex software systems and strategies which were designed without envisaging the great volatility of market prices caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This study focuses on the examination and analysis of the performance of some Forex systems in the period of the pandemic. It identifies failed and successful systems during the period of the pandemic and proposes a pandemic surviving trading model to address the problem of the effect of unforeseen disaster such as the pandemic on trading systems. The systems examines the properties and data of failed and successful systems and integrates the best properties in the proposed model to provide a model which is likely to survive any possible future pandemic. The results show that systems developed with the property oriented pandemic surviving trading model produced a significant increase in profit during the pandemic compared to the existing system. © 2020, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

A loss of productive capacity is stimulating. Costs of restarting firms, lower labour productivity when restarted and a desire to restore wealth from debt incurred during the period of SD are depressive. If, as seems highly probable, the net effect on economic activity is negative then a fiscal expansion can restore activity. To avoid an increased government budget deficit, this expansion would probably require an increased tax rate. Reductions in real wages may also be necessary. A desire to balance the government budget combined with no increase in the tax rate would be unfortunate, because it would cause a further contraction in activity from its post-SD level. © 2020 The University of Melbourne, Melbourne Institute: Applied Economic & Social Research, Faculty of Business and Economics  COVID-19; debt; disease control; economic activity; economic policy; governance approach; labor productivity; macroeconomics; policy analysis; respiratory disease; viral disease; wage Weathering the pandemic: How the Caribbean Basin can use viral and environmental patterns to predict, prepare, and respond to COVID-19 The 2020 coronavirus pandemic is developing at different paces throughout the world. Some areas, like the Caribbean Basin, have yet to see the virus strike at full force. When it does, there is reasonable evidence to suggest the consequent COVID-19 outbreaks will overwhelm healthcare systems and economies. This is particularly concerning in the Caribbean as pandemics can have disproportionately higher mortality impacts on lower and middle-income countries. Preliminary observations from our team and others suggest that temperature and climatological factors could influence the spread of this novel coronavirus, making spatiotemporal predictions of its infectiousness possible. This review studies geographic and time-based distribution of known respiratory viruses in the Caribbean Basin in an attempt to foresee how the pandemic will develop in this region. This review is meant to aid in planning short- and long-term interventions to manage outbreaks at the international, national, and subnational levels in the region. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC coronavirus; pandemic; seasonal incidence air temperature; Caribbean; coronavirus disease 2019; disease predisposition; disease transmission; environmental factor; epidemic; geographic distribution; health care planning; health care system; human; infection prevention; nonhuman; pandemic; prediction; Review; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; weathering Challenges of COVID-19 in children in low- and middle-income countries As the coronavirus pandemic extends to low and middle income countries (LMICs), there are growing concerns about the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in populations with high prevalence of comorbidities, the impact on health and economies more broadly and the capacity of existing health systems to manage the additional burden of COVID-19. The direct effects of COVID are less of a concern in children, who seem to be largely asymptomatic or to develop mild illness as occurs in high income countries; however children in LMICs constitute a high proportion of the population and may have a high prevalence of risk factors for severe lower respiratory infection such as HIV or malnutrition. Further diversion of resources from child health to address the pandemic among adults may further impact on care for children. Poor living conditions in LMICs including lack of sanitation, running water and overcrowding may facilitate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The indirect effects of the pandemic on child health are of considerable concern, including increasing poverty levels, disrupted schooling, lack of access to school feeding schemes, reduced access to health facilities and interruptions in vaccination and other child health programs. Further challenges in LMICs include the inability to implement effective public health measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene, timely identification of infected people with self-isolation and universal use of masks. Lack of adequate personal protective equipment, especially N95 masks is a key concern for health care worker protection. While continued schooling is crucial for children in LMICs, provision of safe environments is especially challenging in overcrowded resource constrained schools. The current crisis is a harsh reminder of the global inequity in health in LMICs. The pandemic highlights key challenges to the provision of health in LMICs, but also provides opportunities to strengthen child health broadly in such settings. © 2020 Child; COVID; Indirect effects; Low-middle income countries; Resource allocation child health; community living; coronavirus disease 2019; crowding (area); disease course; disease transmission; hand washing; health care access; health care facility; health care personnel; health program; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; low income country; malnutrition; middle income country; nonhuman; poverty; prevalence; priority journal; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk factor; sanitation; school; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; social isolation; treatment interruption; vaccination; Betacoronavirus; child; child health; Coronavirus infection; developing country; education; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; malnutrition; pandemic; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; water supply; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child Health; Coronavirus Infections; Crowding; Developing Countries; Education; HIV Infections; Humans; Malnutrition; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Poverty; Risk Factors; Sanitation; Water Supply Pandemic stricken cities on lockdown. Where are our planning and design professionals [now, then and into the future]? Chinese cities have been placed upon lockdown in early 2020 in an attempt to contain the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), as increasingly huge demands are being placed upon Chinese and international health professionals to address this pandemic. Surprisingly, planning and design professionals are absent in the discourses about existing and post−COVID-19 strategies and actions even though previous pandemics historically revealed major impacts on the urban fabric from social and economic perspectives. This paper is a call for action for international architectural and urban organisations to include pandemics and similar in their disaster management strategies. This need is very evident in their need to better design creative and relevant protocols in partnership with health discipine organisations, and so that their applied deployment in pandemic stricken cities can be effected integrated seamlessly within normal city environment planning activities and also in incident situations like containing the current COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Cities; Cooperation; COVID-19; Design institutes; Health policy; Pandemic; Resilience; Smart City; Urban economy; Urban planning COVID-19; disaster management; disease control; future prospect; management practice; planning process; respiratory disease; strategic approach; viral disease; China; Coronavirus Vaccine development against coronavirus (2003 to present): An overview, recent advances, current scenario, opportunities and challenges Background and aim: The pandemic COVID-19 occurring due to novel emerging coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is severely affecting the worldwide public health, culture, economy and human social behaviour. Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine. Method: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: In conclusion, we discuss possible clues/ target sites for designing of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus based on prior-art. © 2020 Diabetes India Adjuvants; Antigens; Coronavirus disease vaccine; COVID-19 vaccine; Spike protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Coronavirus vaccine; DNA vaccine; immunological adjuvant; inactivated vaccine; live vaccine; nanomaterial; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; virus antigen; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; animal model; Article; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug repositioning; human; infection control; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; protein subunit; SARS coronavirus; scale up; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; vaccine production; virus genome; virus mutation; virus virulence; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; immunology; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Viral Vaccines The role of digital media in shaping youth planetary health interests in the global economy Despite revolutionizing the work of practicing economists by providing a direct link between neo-classical economic theory and revealed market preference data, Random Utility Theory has yet to guide research applications in global market sustainability. With the worldwide adverse socio-economic effects of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), such application now becomes timely. Therefore, relying on a Random Utility theoretic formulation of youths' preferences for the biosphere (ecosystem services, sustainability) and science-based disease prevention to characterize their planetary health interests, this paper adopts a micro-based planetary view of markets to retrospectively analyze the health and ecological implications of digital media consumption among youths in the global economy. Empirically, we rely on a mixed bivariate ordered probit specification, which is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Our findings reveal a strong, positive correlation coefficient (0.835) between youths' interests in the biosphere and science-based disease prevention. Moreover, digital media consumption in the form of increased frequency of ecological website visits, news blogs visits, and web-browsing on broad science, significantly reduce youths' interests in the biosphere. A similar reduction in youths' interest in science-based disease prevention is observed, from news blogs visits and web-browsing on broad science. Conversely, ecological website visits appear to raise youths' interests in science-based disease prevention. Furthermore, we find a gender-based gradient in youths' planetary health interest, in favor of the female gender. Overall, our findings confirm the appropriateness of a holistic view of health, and suggests a couple of policy implications for the long-term sustainability of our planet. © 2020 by the authors.

Infectious diseases account for more than 20% of global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths. Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is having serious consequences on health and the economy worldwide. All evidence-based treatment strategies need to be considered to combat this new virus. Drugs need to be considered on scientific grounds of efficacy, safety and cost. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old drugs used in the treatment of malaria. Moreover, their antiviral properties have been previously studied, including against coronaviruses, where evidence of efficacy has been found. In the current race against time triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the search for new antivirals is very important. However, consideration should be given to old drugs with known anti-coronavirus activity, such as CQ and HCQ. These could be integrated into current treatment strategies while novel treatments are awaited, also in light of the fact that they display an anticoagulant effect that facilitates the activity of low-molecular-weight heparin, aimed at preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-associated thrombotic events. The safety of CQ and HCQ has been studied for over 50 years, however recently published data raise concerns for cardiac toxicity of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19. This review also re-examines the real information provided by some of the published alarming reports, although concluding that cardiac toxicity should in any case be stringently monitored in patients receiving CQ/HCQ. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Antiviral; Chloroquine; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2; chloroquine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glycoprotein gp 120; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; papain; papain like protease; quinone reductase 2; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone); tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anticoagulant agent; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; chloroquine; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxychloroquine; immunologic factor; anticoagulation; antiviral activity; Article; autophagy (cellular); avian influenza (H5N1); CD4+ T lymphocyte; disease severity; drug blood level; drug distribution; drug half life; drug mechanism; enzyme inhibition; human; immunomodulation; immunopathogenesis; in vitro study; in vivo study; molecular docking; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein expression; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection; trans Golgi network; virus neutralization; virus replication; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; disseminated intravascular clotting; drug effect; genetics; growth, development and aging; host pathogen interaction; immunology; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anticoagulants; Antiviral Agents; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunologic Factors; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication A scalable topical vectored vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 The severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused an ongoing unprecedented global public health crises of coronavirus disease in 2019 (CoVID-19). The precipitously increased death rates, its impact on livelihood and trembling economies warrant the urgent development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine which would be safe, efficacious and scalable. Owing to unavailability of the vaccine, we propose a de novo synthesized avian orthoavulavirus 1 (AOaV-1)-based topical respiratory vaccine candidate against CoVID-19. Avirulent strain of AOaV-1 was engineered to express full length spike (S) glycoprotein which is highly neutralizing and a major protective antigen of the SARS-CoV-2. Broad-scale in vitro characterization of a recombinant vaccine candidate demonstrated efficient co-expression of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) of AOaV-1 and S protein of SARS-CoV-2, and comparable replication kinetics were observed in a cell culture model. The recombinant vaccine candidate virus actively replicated and spread within cells independently of exogenous trypsin. Interestingly, incorporation of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 into the recombinant AOaV-1 particles attributed the sensitivity to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiserum and more prominently to anti-AOaV-1 antiserum. Finally, our results demonstrated that the recombinant vaccine vector stably expressed S protein after multiple propagations in chicken embryonated eggs, and this expression did not significantly impact the in vitro growth characteristics of the recombinant. Taken together, the presented respiratory vaccine candidate is highly attenuated in primates per se, safe and lacking pre-existing immunity in human, and carries the potential for accelerated vaccine development against CoVID-19 for clinical studies. © 2020 by the authors.

However, in addition to the uncertainty created by the introduction of new technologies, the current coronavirus pandemic, with its associated impact on health and the economy, has led to increased volatility across the globe. The global medical crisis arising from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 is predicted to lead to a global economic crisis and subsequent deep depression. The resultant economic, social and political repercussions are likely to be felt for years or even decades to come, equalling the great depression of the last century. Consequently, it is difficult to make long-term accurate predictions about the impact of new technologies on industry, society, and labour. In this context, the aim of this introductory article to the themed volume is to consider the potential challenges and opportunities associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and potential impacts on work and workplaces. This introductory article comprises an international collection of research that examines the impact of technological change on employment and working conditions with consideration given to the additional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

Several models are under study to control the disease spread and infection rate and to detect possible factors that might favour them, with a focus on understanding the correlation between the disease and specific geophysical parameters. However, the pandemic does not present evident environmental hindrances in the infected countries. Nevertheless, a lower rate of infections has been observed in some countries, which might be related to particular population and climatic conditions. In this paper, infection rate of COVID-19 is modelled globally at a 0.5∘ resolution, using a Maximum Entropy-based Ecological Niche Model that identifies geographical areas potentially subject to a high infection rate. The model identifies locations that could favour infection rate due to their particular geophysical (surface air temperature, precipitation, and elevation) and human-related characteristics (CO2 and population density). It was trained by facilitating data from Italian provinces that have reported a high infection rate and subsequently tested using datasets from World countries’ reports. Based on this model, a risk index was calculated to identify the potential World countries and regions that have a high risk of disease increment. The distribution outputs foresee a high infection rate in many locations where real-world disease outbreaks have occurred, e.g. the Hubei province in China, and reports a high risk of disease increment in most World countries which have reported significant outbreaks (e.g. Western U.S.A.). Overall, the results suggest that a complex combination of the selected parameters might be of integral importance to understand the propagation of COVID-19 among human populations, particularly in Europe. The model and the data were distributed through Open-science Web services to maximise opportunities for re-usability regarding new data and new diseases, and also to enhance the transparency of the approach and results. © 2020 The Author(s) Coronavirus; COVID-19; Ecological niche modelling; Maximum entropy; SARS-CoV-2 Disease control; Distributed database systems; Ecology; Geophysics; Health risks; Population statistics; Web services; Climatic conditions; Ecological niche modeling; Geographical area; Geophysical parameters; Monitoring strategy; Population densities; Rate of infections; Surface air temperatures; Diseases; climate conditions; data set; disease spread; ecological modeling; global change; human activity; infectious disease; niche; population outbreak; prediction; virus; China; Europe; Hubei; United States; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus Investigation of the D614G mutation and antibody-dependent enhancement sequences in indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and comparison to southeast Asian isolates Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading virus that poses a major burden on global human health and the economy. Therefore, it is essential to develop COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccine construction might not be easy, as a consequence of mutations and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Objective: We first reported the D614G mutation and ADE sequences in Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and compared these isolates to those from other Southeast Asian countries. Methods: In this study, we extracted the SARS-CoV-2 genome of 40 Indonesian isolates from the GISAID EpiCoV database and the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (reference sequence) from GenBank, NCBI. We used BioEdit v7.2.5 to identify the D614G mutation and ADE sequences in the spike protein. Then, we rendered the spike protein using the SWISS-MODEL web server and PyMOL v2.4. Results: We identified the D614G missense mutation in 23 Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates and isolates from six other Southeast Asian countries. In addition, we identified the ADE sequence 611LYQDVNC617 in the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, which had changed into 611LYQGVNC617 in recent mutated isolates. Conclusion: We conclude that the D614G mutation might affect ADE activities. A rapid but cautious approach to the vaccine development and other therapies developed for COVID-19 seems needed until we have more data on the risks of the D614G mutation and ADE. However, further studies including in vitro and in vivo assessments are relevant for validation of these results. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.

SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, however there have been previous outbreaks of different versions of the beta coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV1) from 2002 to 2003 and the most recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. All of the above have been recognised as major pathogens that are a great threat to public health and global economies. Currently, no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified; however, certain drugs have shown apparent efficacy in viral inhibition of the disease. Natural substances such as herbs and mushrooms have previously demonstrated both great antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, the possibilities of natural substances as effective treatments against COVID-19 may seem promising. One of the potential candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be Inonotus obliquus (IO), also known as chaga mushroom. IO commonly grows in Asia, Europe and North America and is widely used as a raw material in various medical conditions. In this review, we have evaluated the most effective herbs and mushrooms, in terms of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects which have been assessed in laboratory conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

The crisis of care, I contend, is fundamentally a political and an ethical crisis. In this short commentary, I outline the structural (i.e., systemic) and reproductive (i.e., labour) character of this crisis, using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example. From here, I argue for the imperative to centre an expansive conception of care in critical community psychology work. Specifically, I posit that by working with and alongside activist care workers, community psychologists can assist in building socially just modalities of care. After reflecting on my work with collective caring initiatives, I offer five (tentative) guiding principles for a community psychology that is committed to addressing the crisis of care, namely: (1) commitment to building political coalitions; (2) commitment to refuting capitalist conceptions of care; (3) commitment to expanding conceptions of care; (4) commitment to embracing the psychological consequences of care work; and (5) a politicoethical commitment. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC activism; care; COVID-19; reproductive labour; social movements Coronavirus infection; demography; health care delivery; health care personnel; human; pandemic; politics; psychology; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Politics; Psychology, Applied; Residence Characteristics Genotyping coronavirus SARS-CoV-2: methods and implications The emerging global infectious COVID-19 disease by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late December 2019 in China. The virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. 2019-nCoV; COVID-19; Genotyping; SARS-CoV-2; Single-nucleotide polymorphism nucleoprotein; protein RNA primase; RNA polymerase; unclassified drug; viral protein; vitronectin; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; epidemic; gene isolation; gene location; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic variation; genotype; human; infection control; nonhuman; pathogenicity; priority journal; sequence alignment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; single nucleotide polymorphism; vaccine production; virus isolation; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; genomics; genotyping technique; molecular evolution; mutation; pandemic; procedures; single nucleotide polymorphism; virus genome; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Viral; Genomics; Genotyping Techniques; Humans; Mutation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Alignment Plants-derived biomolecules as potent antiviral phytomedicines: New insights on ethnobotanical evidences against coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) is in focus over all known human diseases, because it is destroying the world economy and social life, with increased mortality rate each day. To date, there is no specific medicine or vaccine available against this pandemic disease. However, the presence of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules with antiviral properties might also be a successful strategy in order to develop therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this review will summarize the available literature and other information/data sources related to antiviral medicinal plants, with possible ethnobotanical evidence in correlation with coronaviruses. The identification of novel antiviral compounds is of critical significance, and medicinal plant based natural compounds are a good source for such discoveries. In depth search and analysis revealed several medicinal plants with excellent efficacy against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which are well-known to act on ACE-2 receptor, 3CLpro and other viral protein targets. In this review, we have consolidated the data of several medicinal plants and their natural bioactive metabolites, which have promising antiviral activities against coronaviruses with detailed modes of action/mechanism. It is concluded that this review will be useful for researchers worldwide and highly recommended for the development of naturally safe and effective therapeutic drugs/agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be used in therapeutic protocols alone or in combination with chemically synthetized drugs. © 2020, MDPI AG.

The COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be an enormous challenge to the health of the world population with tremendous consequences for the world economy. New knowledge about COVID-19 is being acquired continuously. Although the main manifestation of COVID-19 is SARS, dysfunction in other organs has been described in the last months. Neurological aspects of COVID-19 are still an underreported subject. However, a plethora of previous studies has shown that human CoVs might be neurotropic, neuroinvasive, and neurovirulent, highlighting the importance of this knowledge by physicians. Besides, several neurological manifestations had been described as complications of two other previous outbreaks of CoV diseases (SARS ad Middle East respiratory syndrome). Therefore, we should be watchful, searching for early evidence of neurological insults and promoting clinical protocols to investigate them. Our objectives are to review the potential neuropathogenesis of this new CoV and the neurological profile of COVID-19 patients described so far. © 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene  immunoglobulin; cerebrovascular accident; coronavirus disease 2019; cranial neuropathy; frontal lobe; Guillain Barre syndrome; human; necrotizing encephalopathy; nervous system; neurologic disease; neuropathology; nonhuman; respiratory virus; Review; SARS coronavirus; sequence homology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smelling disorder; taste disorder; thrombosis; virus entry; virus genome; virus morphology; virus particle; Betacoronavirus; complication; Coronavirus infection; neurologic disease; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the novel coronavirus among Bangladeshis: Implications for mitigation measures The current novel coronavirus (nCoV) pandemic, COVID-19, was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally, causing startling loss of life, stalling the global economy, and disrupting social life. One of the challenges to contain COVID-19 is convincing people to adopt personal hygiene, social distancing, and self-quarantine practices that are related to knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the residents of respective countries. Bangladesh, a densely populated country with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may help policy makers produce informed decisions. This study assessed KAP in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1,837 responses across Bangladesh. Ultimately, 1,589 completed responses were included in a statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores and their interrelations with sociodemographic variables. The overall KAP was poor, with only 33% of the participants demonstrating good knowledge, whereas 52.4% and 44.8% of the subjects showed good attitudes and practices, respectively. Sociodemographic factors had strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP scores were evident in females over males, among aged 45 years and older over younger participants, and among retired workers and homemakers over students and public service employees. This study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to foster public confidence and ensure more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures. This study provides a KAP baseline regarding COVID-19 among Bangladeshis. © 2020 Paul et al.

The improvement of façades is among the most common measures to reduce energy consumption. However, the effect of thermal bridges is undervalued in most cases. This study assesses the effect of improving building façades and thermal bridges. For this purpose, a case study is assessed for all climate zones in Spain, both in current and future scenarios, considering operational patterns from the COVID-19 pandemic. The study shows that the application of energy conservation measures focusing on reducing the thermal transmittance of façades and the linear thermal transmittance of thermal bridges has a more significant energy and environmental effect than other, more economical energy conservation measures that do not improve the effect of thermal bridges. Likewise, the application of energy conservation measures to improve façades can reduce carbon dioxide emissions but are far from achieving the 90% reduction set by the European Union by 2050. Consequently, these measures should be combined with other measures. © 2020 by the author.

The aims of this work are to find a relationship between self-assessed health and internet use by older people in European countries and to ascertain whether this relationship differs in countries with a more developed eHealth policy. Materials and methods: An ordered logistic regression is estimated for all countries in the sample and for two countries subsets which differ in their eHealth performance. Individual data is collected by SHARE. The classifying criterion of eHealth performance is based on the ‘eHealth’ policy dimension of the indicator used to construct the Digital Economy and Society Index. The average marginal effects are computed for the variable of internet use. Results: Results show that older people who use the internet tend to report better health status. This relationship however may not hold for low levels of health and it is stronger in countries with low eHealth performance. Conclusion: Policy measures on eHealth not only contribute to people's health but also help to alleviate critical situations such as the one created by the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Based on in-depth interviews with supply chain professionals and grounded theory approach, we constructed a framework of global sourcing improvement to support better utilization of lean, agile, and leagile strategies, which we believe can help the supply chains worldwide to act better, especially in various difficult conditions and sustain their business accordingly. Our proposed framework also contributes to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, since the core concept of the framework is to establish a new organization under the umbrella of the UN to improve the global sourcing and consequently the usage of supply chain strategies accordingly. The applicative part of the paper reveals characteristics of new developed framework, ranging from its purpose and aims, structure, key processes, functions, and its financing. Along with validation of the framework are presented benefits for society, industry, and global economy. Additionally, the paper also reviews the impact of the current health and economic crisis caused by COVID 19, on usage of the three supply chain strategies namely; lean, agility, and leagility to see how they can work in the difficult time, as COVID 19. © 2020 by the authors.

The impacts of coronavirus are most apparent at the international business level due to the restrictions on travel and mobility of labor. This has necessitated an entrepreneurial outlook for businesses in order to survive in the current market environment. The aim of this article is to discuss the implications of the coronavirus for international business by taking an entrepreneurial ecosystem point of view. This enables a reflection on how the pandemic has impacted various entities of the ecosystem in terms of stakeholder engagement. Suggestions for acting in a more dynamic and innovative manner are provided that highlight the importance of utilizing entrepreneurial ecosystems in times of crises. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC. coronavirus; crisis; ecosystem; entrepreneurship; international business; pandemic  Controversial treatments: An updated understanding of the coronavirus disease 2019 An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 infection has posed significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China. To reduce the case-fatality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, we should not ignore the complications, such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, and chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation based on available evidence. As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. coronavirus; COVID-19; literature review; pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2; treatment chloroquine; corticosteroid; placebo; remdesivir; ribavirin; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiviral therapy; avascular necrosis; cardiotoxicity; case fatality rate; continuous hemofiltration; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; diabetes mellitus; drug accumulation; drug blood level; drug mechanism; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; extracorporeal oxygenation; hemolytic anemia; hemorrhagic fever; human; influenza A (H7N9); liver failure; malaria; Middle East respiratory syndrome; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; plasma exchange; psychosis; retinopathy; Review; secondary infection; severe acute respiratory syndrome; unspecified side effect A case for girl-child education to prevent and curb the impact of emerging infectious diseases epidemics Not only do epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), and the current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) cause the loss of millions of lives, but they also cost the global economy billions of dollars. Consequently, there is an urgent need to formulate interventions that will help control their spread and impact when they emerge. The education of young girls and women is one such historical approach. They are usually the vulnerable targets of disease outbreaks – they are most likely to be vehicles for the spread of epidemics due to their assigned traditional roles in resource-limited countries. Based on our work and the work of others on educational interventions, we propose six critical components of a cost-effective and sustainable response to promote girl-child education in resource-limited settings. © 2020, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine Inc.

By paying close attention to the public debate and by interviewing the federation's communication director, the authors outlined the four phases of the strategic crisis communication - and the consequences of them in Norway. While the first consequence was the postponing of the Euro Qualifier against Serbia on March 26 for the European Championship this summer, the lockdown changed the focus quickly, and the strategy became about getting all players back on the football fields. The authors elaborated on how a major federation can (and maybe should) take a leading role by using its ""voice""in the media and public and expertise to aid reopening a society after lockdown. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.

From this perspective, plasmonic-based biosensing can manage the threat of infectious diseases by providing timely virus monitoring. In recent years, many plasmonics’ platforms have embraced the challenge of offering on-site strategies to complement traditional diagnostic methods relying on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This review compiled recent progress on the development of novel plasmonic sensing schemes for the effective control of virus-related diseases. A special focus was set on the utilization of plasmonic nanostructures in combination with other detection formats involving colorimetric, fluorescence, luminescence, or Raman scattering enhancement. The quantification of different viruses (e.g., hepatitis virus, influenza virus, norovirus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus) with particular attention to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reviewed from the perspective of the biomarker and the biological receptor immobilized on the sensor chip. Technological limitations including selectivity, stability, and monitoring in biological matrices were also reviewed for different plasmonic-sensing approaches. © 2020 by the author.

COVID-19 is exposing a nexus between communities disproportionately suffering from underlying health conditions, policy-reinforced disparities, and susceptibility to the disease. As the virus spreads, policy responses will need to shift from focusing on surveillance and mitigation to recovery and prevention. Local governments, with their histories of mutual aid and familiarity with local communities, are capable of meeting these challenges. However, funding must flow in a flexible enough fashion for local governments to tailor their efforts to preserve vital services and rebuild local economies. The authors argue that the Community Development Block Grant and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant programs are mechanisms for providing funds in a manner that is adaptable to local context while also focusing on increasing social equity. Administrators must emphasize the fourth pillar of public administration—social equity—in framing government responses to the pandemic. © 2020 by The American Society for Public Administration   The role of climate change in the emergence and spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV2, continues to pose a global threat. The consequences from the pandemic are devastating, not only for human health and the national health systems throughout the world, but also for the global economy. Bats, pangolins, muskrats and other wild animals have been implicated as possible hosts of the virus. According to recent research data, the increased concentration of particulate air matter in the atmosphere appears to have contributed significantly to the spread (airborne transmission) and aggressiveness of the disease, as large cities with high levels of air pollution showed the highest numbers of SARS-CoV2 cases and deaths. It also appears that the collapse of natural ecosystems resulting from the ever-evolving climate change has been crucial for the migration of animals to new areas and their interaction with other animals that they would not normally encounter, resulting in the emergence of new pathogens, which in turn infected humans. It is now clear that the era of “climate medicine” which will be a cornerstone for the practice of medicine in the 21st century, has already begun. © Athens Medical Society.

Based upon current researches, this virus is spreading from one human to another through respiratory droplets, i.e. cough and sneeze. Till now, there has not been any specific treatment found for this virus. Hence, there is a critical need to discover alternative techniques to cope with the current scenario. Recent Findings: This review conducted an online search for prevention of coronavirus infection with the help of nutritional interventions. It has been observed that the effect of the virus is mostly on the individual with low immunity, individual affected with diseases like diabetes, and individual using any immune-suppressed drug or having past history of major surgeries or severe medical conditions. Summary: Therefore, consuming foods which boost immunity helps in preventing respiratory-related disorder or suppressing diseases-related problems, which could be helpful in controlling the spread of this virus. In conclusion, it has been suggested that before the beginning of generalised treatments and interventions in each infected patient, nutritional status should be evaluated, as it can help in creating a specific nutrition intervention for the infected individual. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Now in the 21st century in the post‐antibiotic era, the miracle is turning into a nightmare, due to the growing problem of the resistance of microorganisms to classic antimicrobials and the non‐investment by the pharmaceutical industry in new antimicrobial agents. Unfortunately, the current COVID‐19 pandemic has demonstrated the global risks associated with uncontrolled infections and the various forms of impact that such a pandemic may have on the economy and on social habits besides the associated morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to recycle classic antibiotics, as is the case in the use of ionic liquids (ILs) based on antibiotics. Thus, the aim of the present review is to summarize the data on ILs, mainly those with antimicrobial action and especially against resistant strains. The main conclusions of this article are that ILs are flexible due to their ability to modulate cations and anions as a salt, making it possible to combine the properties of both and multiplying the activity of separate cations and anions. Also, these compounds have low cost methods of production, which makes it highly attractive to explore them, especially as antimicrobial agents and against resistant strains. ILs may further be combined with other therapeutic strategies, such as phage or lysine therapy, enhancing the therapeutic arsenal needed to fight this worldwide problem of antibacterial resistance. Thus, the use of ILs as antibiotics by themselves or together with phage therapy and lysine therapy are promising alternatives against pathogenic microorganisms, and may have the possibility to be used in new ways in order to restrain uncontrolled infections. © 2020 by the authors.

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, is even more devastating in terms of patient mortality. At the time of this writing, the nanoscopic SARS-Cov-2 virus has paralyzed the world economy and resulted in what are likely permanent changes in our expectations of society and daily life. New technology is needed to reduce the economic and social impacts of diseases such as COVID-19 and prevent additional negative consequences resulting from subsequent pandemics. As viruses such as Influenza A and SARS-Cov-2 are transmitted from person to person by exposure to infected secretions, inexpensive at-home or workplace tests for the analysis of the virus content within those secretions, such as saliva or mucus from the nasopharynx (as in a swab-based test) or oropharynx (as in a saliva-based test), will be critical for a safe return to work, school, and cultural activities. The most reliable approaches for viral sensing are polymerase chain reaction and protein detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; however, these approaches require extensive sample handling, laboratory infrastructure, and long sample-to-result time. Advances are leading to increased point-of-care capability for these testing methods, but even this effort is insufficient for curbing the impact of the current pandemic. There are many options for alternative virus (or antigen) detection currently in development. These novel approaches are more amenable for testing in home or workplace without specialized equipment and training and include measurements of mass changes, heat of adsorption, electrochemical changes, changes in optical properties, and changes in electronic properties. Of these transduction mechanisms, electronic property measurements of materials as they interact with virus-containing secretions offer the greatest potential for simplicity, selectivity, and sensitivity needed to revolutionize traditional laboratory assays for at-home pathogen detection. We have, therefore, focused this review on the operation and architecture of electronic antigen sensors, specifically those demonstrating a change in electrical conductivity when interacting with a specific antigen, with hopes that a brief summary of over five decades of research in this area will be beneficial to those developing alternative, user-friendly routes for detection of viruses at this or any time. A key element in electronic virus sensing with useful sensitivity is the use of nanomaterials with ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratios, maximizing the change in charge carrier density upon adsorption events. So-called ""low-dimensional materials""are materials characterized by nanoscopic length scales in at least one dimension. One-dimensional nanomaterials such as nanowires and nanotubes are well-established as effective sensing materials with potential for high sensitivity; however, their realization on a large scale has been challenging. Two-dimensional materials are planar materials with thicknesses of one or a few molecular layers and represent the ultimate limit of the surface-to-volume ratio with promising demonstrations of large-scale production and sensitive, selective virus sensing with many options for functionalization. All aspects of 2D sensor fabrication, functionalization, and use are addressed. © 2020 Author(s).

Because approved drugs and vaccines are limited or not available, new options for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are in high demand. To identify SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, we analyzed the antibody response of 12 COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days after diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early as 8 days after diagnosis. Of these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC100 as low as 0.04 μg/mL, showing a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and low levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursor sequences were identified in naive B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals who were sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies are readily generated from a diverse pool of precursors, fostering hope for rapid induction of a protective immune response upon vaccination. © 2020 The Author(s)In a longitudinal analysis of SARS-CoV-2-infected people, Kreer et al. find highly potent neutralizing antibodies that use a broad spectrum of variable (V) genes and show low levels of somatic mutations. They also identify potential precursor sequences of these SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies from virus-naive individuals, sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. This could indicate that neutralizing antibodies can be readily generated from existing germline antibody sequences found in the general population. © 2020 The Author(s) 2019-nCoV; COVID-19; monoclonal antibody; neutralizing antibody; SARS-CoV-2; single B cell analysis immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G1 antibody; neutralizing antibody; vitronectin; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; adult; antibody isolation; antibody response; antigen binding; Article; B lymphocyte; cell screening; cell selection; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; female; gene sequence; human; human cell; longitudinal study; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; somatic mutation; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; immunoglobulin variable region; immunological memory; immunology; isolation and purification; pandemic; somatic hypermutation; virus pneumonia; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; B-Lymphocytes; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunoglobulin Variable Region; Immunologic Memory; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin Daily Monitoring of Emotional Responses to the Coronavirus Pandemic in Serbia: A Citizen Science Approach The COVID-19 pandemic, a health emergency with international consequences, has brought serious impact on all aspects of society and affects not only health and economy, but psychological functioning and mental health as well. This research was conducted in order to examine and further our understanding of emotional reactions to the ongoing pandemic. Change in emotional reactions during the pandemic and relations with specific pandemic related behaviors and personality traits from the revised Reinforcement sensitivity theory were explored. The research was conducted in Serbia for 35 days while the country was in a state of emergency, as a citizen science project. Out of the 1526 participants that joined the study, 444 (67% female) had measures for all five weeks. Longitudinal changes in four emotional states during the pandemic were examined: worry, fear, boredom, and anger/annoyance. Results indicate a decrease in all four emotional states over time. The biggest decrease was present in case of worry, followed by fear and boredom. Regression analysis showed that personality dimensions, as well as behavioral responses in this situation significantly predicted emotional reactions. Findings revealed the Behavioral activation system was significantly related to worry, fear and boredom, Fight with boredom and anger, and the Behavioral inhibition system with anger. Adherence to protection measures, as well as increased exposure to the media, had significant positive relations with worry and fear. These results indicate that both stable characteristics and specific pandemic-related behaviors are significantly related to emotional response during the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Sadiković, Branovački, Oljača, Mitrović, Pajić and Smederevac. citizen science; COVID-19; emotional reactions; RRST; the state of emergency  Communicable Diseases (Including COVID-19)—Induced Global Depression: Caused by Inadequate Healthcare Expenditures, Population Density, and Mass Panic Coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading at an enormous rate and has caused deaths beyond expectations due to a variety of reasons. These include: (i) inadequate healthcare spending causing, for instance, a shortage of protective equipment, testing swabs, masks, surgical gloves, gowns, etc.; (ii) a high population density that causes close physical contact among community members who reside in compact places, hence they are more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases, including coronavirus; and (iii) mass panic due to the fear of experiencing the loss of loved ones, lockdown, and shortage of food. In a given scenario, the study focused on the following key variables: communicable diseases, healthcare expenditures, population density, poverty, economic growth, and COVID-19 dummy variable in a panel of 76 selected countries from 2010 through 2019. The results show that the impact of communicable diseases on economic growth is positive because the infected countries get a reap of economic benefits from other countries in the form of healthcare technologies, knowledge transfers, cash transfers, international loans, aid, etc., to get rid of the diseases. However, the case is different with COVID-19 as it has seized the whole world together in a much shorter period of time and no other countries are able to help others in terms of funding loans, healthcare facilities, or technology transfers. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 in the given study is negatively impacting countries' economic growth that converts into a global depression. The high incidence of poverty and social closeness increases more vulnerable conditions that spread coronavirus across countries. The momentous increase in healthcare expenditures put a burden on countries' national healthcare bills that stretch the depression phase-out of the boundary. The forecasting relationship suggested the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy would last the next 10 years. Unified global healthcare policies, physical distancing, smart lockdowns, and meeting food challenges are largely required to combat the coronavirus pandemic and escape from global depression. © Copyright © 2020 Anser, Yousaf, Khan, Sheikh, Nassani, Abro and Zaman.

Using a sample of 23 emerging markets across three regions, our findings suggest that decreasing (increasing) trend in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases is associated with improving (deteriorating) liquidity in financial markets. We also find that policy interventions in terms of restrictions on movement and businesses are associated with improved liquidity. Results suggest that flattening curve of coronavirus infections helps reduce uncertainty among investors. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In February 2020 an online questionnaire and follow-up interviews were conducted on 4807 SMEs in Sichuan to assess the challenges associated with work resumption and the associated policy requirements. It was found that most SMEs were unable to resume work because of a shortage of epidemic mitigation materials, the inability of employees to return to work, disrupted supply chains, and reduced market demand. Many SMEs were also facing cash flow risks as they had to continue to pay for various fixed expenditures even though they had little or no revenue. As these delays in work resumption have put unprecedented pressures on the survival of many SMEs, recommendations relevant to China and other affected countries regarding cash flow relief, work resumption and consumption stimulation are given to assist SME survival and economic recovery from the disaster situation. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

While, on one hand, medical institutions are critically attempting to find a cure, on the other hand, governments have introduced striking measures and policies to curtail the rapid spread of the disease. Although COVID-19 has achieved pandemic status and is predominantly viewed as a biomedical issue, it is argued that it should also be treated as a psychological crisis. This paper also reviews the literature to examine and comment on the detrimental effects of isolation, which has been enforced as one of the primary preventative measures to manage the spread of COVID-19. This paper further outlines key recommendations that should be addressed across different levels to buffer against the known adverse effects of isolation, which is especially relevant for the current COVID-19 situation, where a large proportion of the global population is isolated, confined, and/or quarantined. © Copyright © 2020 Roychowdhury. 2019 novel coronavirus disease; coronavirus; crisis; health; isolation; psychology; recommendations; wellbeing  An Alphavirus-derived replicon RNA vaccine induces SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in mice and nonhuman primates The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is having a deleterious impact on health services and the global economy, highlighting the urgent need for an effective vaccine. Such a vaccine would need to rapidly confer protection after one or two doses and would need to be manufactured using components suitable for scale up. Here, we developed an Alphavirus-derived replicon RNA vaccine candidate, repRNA-CoV2S, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. The RNA replicons were formulated with lipid inorganic nanoparticles (LIONs) that were designed to enhance vaccine stability, delivery, and immunogenicity. We show that a single intramuscular injection of the LION/repRNA-CoV2S vaccine in mice elicited robust production of anti–SARS-CoV-2 S protein IgG antibody isotypes indicative of a type 1 T helper cell response. A prime/boost regimen induced potent T cell responses in mice including antigen-specific responses in the lung and spleen. Prime-only immunization of aged (17 months old) mice induced smaller immune responses compared to young mice, but this difference was abrogated by booster immunization. In nonhuman primates, prime-only immunization in one intramuscular injection site or prime/boost immunizations in five intramuscular injection sites elicited modest T cell responses and robust antibody responses. The antibody responses persisted for at least 70 days and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at titers comparable to those in human serum samples collected from individuals convalescing from COVID-19. These data support further development of LION/repRNA-CoV2S as a vaccine candidate for prophylactic protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved.

Using data from 20 selected African countries, the study found that the reliance on local medicines alongside other salient global initiatives for containment of COVID-19 is effective in managing the pandemic in Africa. It concluded that despite the high vulnerabilities of African countries to COVID-19, the glocal approach has yielded positive outcomes by increasing the number of patients that recover from COVID-19 and scaling down the fatalities compared with the other regions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Since the beginning of 2020, this stability has been undergoing one of the most vigorous pressure tests ever due to the COVID-19 outbreak. From a mere health issue, the pandemic has turned into an economic threat to food security globally in the forms of lockdowns, economic decline, food trade restrictions, and rising food inflation. It is safe to assume that the novel health crisis has badly struck the least developed and developing economies, where people are particularly vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition. However, due to the recency of the COVID-19 problem, the impacts of macroeconomic fluctuations on food insecurity have remained scantily explored. In this study, the authors attempted to bridge this gap by revealing interactions between the food security status of people and the dynamics of COVID-19 cases, food trade, food inflation, and currency volatilities. The study was performed in the cases of 45 developing economies distributed to three groups by the level of income. The consecutive application of the autoregressive distributed lag method, Yamamoto’s causality test, and variance decomposition analysis allowed the authors to find the food insecurity effects of COVID-19 to be more perceptible in upper-middle-income economies than in the least developed countries. In the latter, food security risks attributed to the emergence of the health crisis were mainly related to economic access to adequate food supply (food inflation), whereas in higher-income developing economies, availability-sided food security risks (food trade restrictions and currency depreciation) were more prevalent. The approach presented in this paper contributes to the establishment of a methodology framework that may equip decision-makers with up-to-date estimations of health crisis effects on economic parameters of food availability and access to staples in food-insecure communities. © 2020 by the authors.

Each country has a different response method, and the damage scale is also distinct. This study aims to find out how COVID-19-related news was handled in the domestic media to seek ways to minimize the pandemic. The paper focuses on the number of news features by period and by disaster and analyzes related words based on big data. The results of the analysis are as follows. First, in the initial response phase, keywords to identify accurate sources of actual broadcast contents, fake news, social networking service (SNS), etc. were also ranked in the top 20. Second, in the active response phase, when the number of confirmed persons and the government’s countermeasures were announced, more than 100 COVID-19-related articles were issued, and the related words increased rapidly from the initial response stage. Therefore, the fact that COVID-19 has been expressed as a keyword indicates that our society is watching with great interest in the government’s response to the disease. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: 230 National Health System hospitals were studied over the two-year period 2010–2012 according to their ownership structure— public hospitals, private hospitals and public–private partnership (PPP)—data envelopment analysis orientated to inputs was used to measure the overall technical efficiency, pure efficiency and efficiency of scale. A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with binomial distribution and logit link function was used to analyse the hospital and regional variables associated with positioning on the frontier. Results: There are substantial differences between the average pure technical efficiency of public, private and PPP hospitals, as well as a greater number of PPP models being positioned on the efficiency frontier (91.67% in 2012). The odds of being positioned on the frontier are 41.7 times higher in PPP models than in public hospitals. The average annual household income per region is related to the greater odds of hospitals being positioned on the frontier of efficiency. Conclusions: During the most acute period of recession in the Spanish economy, PPP formulas favoured hospital efficiency, by increasing the odds of being positioned on the frontier of efficiency when compared to private and public hospitals. The position on the frontier of efficiency of a hospital is related to the wealth of its region. © MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

This paper quantitatively assesses the potential of government investments in eco-friendly construction projects to boost the economy and simultaneously realise environmental gains through reduced energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis uses a Computable General Equilibrium model that examines the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis in a small open economy (Belgium). Subsequently, the impact of the proposed policy is assessed through comparative analysis for macroeconomic parameters as well as CO2 equivalent emissions for four scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic damages economies considerably, however, the reduction in emissions is less than proportionate. Still, well-designed public policies can reverse this trend, achieving both economic growth and a disproportionally large decrease in emissions. Moreover, the positive effect of such a decoupling policy on GDP is even stronger during the pandemic than compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. This is the result of a targeted, investment-induced green transition towards low energy-intensive economic activities. Finally, this paper describes how the net effect on the government budget is positive through the indirect gains of the economic uptake. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

While distancing measures can safeguard public health, they also can profoundly impact the economy and may have important indirect effects on the environment. The extent to which physical distancing measures should be applied therefore depends on the trade-offs between their health benefits and their economic costs. We develop an epidemiological-economic model to examine the optimal duration and intensity of physical distancing measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. In an application to the United States, our model considers the trade-off between the lives saved by physical distancing—both directly from stemming the spread of the virus and indirectly from reductions in air pollution during the period of physical distancing—and the short- and long-run economic costs that ensue from such measures. We examine the effect of air pollution co-benefits on the optimal physical distancing policy and conduct sensitivity analyses to gauge the influence of several key parameters and uncertain model assumptions. Using recent estimates of the association between airborne particulate matter and the virulence of COVID-19, we find that accounting for air pollution co-benefits can significantly increase the intensity and duration of the optimal physical distancing policy. To conclude, we broaden our discussion to consider the possibility of durable changes in peoples’ behavior that could alter local markets, the global economy, and our relationship to nature for years to come. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Social distancing adopted by the governments in most countries of the world to contain the outbreak of the virus has many implications for the financial reporting of economic entities. The aim of the article is to consider the potential consequences of coronavirus for the presentation and disclosure of information in financial statements by economic entities. Emphasis is placed on assessing the international economic situation caused by the pandemic, the restrictions adopted by the authorities to curb the spread of coronavirus and the actions of financial reporting compilers in terms of reflecting adjusting and non-adjusting events after the reporting period and assuming going concern. As a result of the study the world economic situation and the negative risks and factors that the financial reporting compilers should pay particular attention during the presentation and disclosure of information are examined. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.

Measures adopted to mitigate risk from the pandemic have had severe impacts on tourism, remittances, and international trade, among other aspects of the political economy of the region, and are thus impacting on food systems, food security and livelihoods. Of particular concern will be the interplay between loss of incomes and the availability and affordability of local and imported foods. In this paper, we examine some of the key pathways of impact on food systems, and identify opportunities to strengthen Pacific food systems during these challenging times. The great diversity among Pacific Island Countries and Territories in their economies, societies, and agricultural potential will be an important guide to planning interventions and developing scenarios of alternative futures. Bolstering regional production and intraregional trade in a currently import-dependent region could strengthen the regional economy, and provide the health benefits of consuming locally produced and harvested fresh foods – as well as decreasing reliance on global supply chains. However, significant production, processing, and storage challenges remain and would need to be consistently overcome to influence a move away from shelf-stable foods, particularly during periods when human movement is restricted and during post-disaster recovery. © 2020, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.

This disease has hugely affected healthcare systems as well as the economy to an extent never seen before. To date, COVID-19 infection has led to about 165000 deaths in 150 countries. At present, there is no specific drug or efficient treatment for this disease. In this analysis based on evidential relationships of the biological characteristics of MSCs, especially umbilical cord (UC)-derived MSCs as well as the first clinical trial using MSCs for COVID-19 treatment, we discuss the use of UC-MSCs to improve the symptoms of COVID-19 in patients. ©The Author(s) 2020.

Unfortunately, there is not currently available vaccine for SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19. Various types of patients have delayed treatment or even routine check-ups and we are adapting to a virtual world. In many cases, surgeries are delayed unless they are essential. This is also true with regards to cancer treatments and screening. Interestingly, some existing drugs and nutraceuticals have been screened for their effects on COVID-19. Certain FDA approved drugs, vitamin, natural products and trace minerals may be repurposed to treat or improve the prevention of COVID-19 infections and disease progression. This review article will summarize how the treatments of various cancer patients has changed during the COVID-19 era as well as discuss the promise of some existing drugs and other agents to be repurposed to treat this disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Cancer; COVID-19; Natural products; Nutraceuticals; Repurposing approved drugs angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antineoplastic agent; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxychloroquine; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; trace element; vitamin; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; immunology; neoplasm; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; virology; virus pneumonia; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Trace Elements; Vitamins COVID-19: Drug development and kidney related problems Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious disease affecting almost every country in the world. This disease makes some problems in the health system, society, politics, and economy. Several reports showed that mortality in COVID-19 patients was related to abnormal kidney function. This condition should be considered to prevent death. Some investigational drugs are on the way in the preclinical and clinical trials. Some of them no have a study for safety in the kidney especially in chronic kidney disease patients including those who undergo hemodialysis. Some give a satisfying effect. Understanding COVID-19, kidney diseases, and drugs will help us to get the most potent treatment. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.

While much of the economy has been shut down, essential public services have continued. Using professional experience, publicly available information, and interviews with two municipal utility managers, we evaluate the challenges presented to municipal utility services by the COVID-19 pandemic and explore some of the responses by utilities to the pandemic. Specifically, we focus on the strategies utilities have used to keep employees safe from the virus and plans for workforce shortages. One important strategy we identify is reliance on mutual aid agreements, where utilities agree to send staff and equipment to other utilities in times of crisis. We also explore the role of a municipal utility association in coordinating response. The case of utility response to COVID-19 carries important potential implications for both public administration practice and research. © The Author(s) 2020. collaboaration; COVID-19; utilities  The Unintended Impact of Colombia’s Covid-19 Lockdown on Forest Fires The covid-19 pandemic led to rapid and large-scale government intervention in economies and societies. A common policy response to covid-19 outbreaks has been the lockdown or quarantine. Designed to slow the spread of the disease, lockdowns have unintended consequences for the environment. This article examines the impact of Colombia’s lockdown on forest fires, motivated by satellite data showing a particularly large upsurge of fires at around the time of lockdown implementation. We find that Colombia’s lockdown is associated with an increase in forest fires compared to three different counterfactuals, constructed to simulate the expected number of fires in the absence of the lockdown. To varying degrees across Colombia’s regions, the presence of armed groups is correlated with this fire upsurge. Mechanisms through which the lockdown might influence fire rates are discussed, including the mobilisation of armed groups and the reduction in the monitoring capacity of state and conservation organisations during the covid-19 outbreak. Given the fast-developing situation in Colombia, we conclude with some ideas for further research. © 2020, The Author(s).

The resources of some of the largest economies are stressed out due to the large infectivity and transmissibility of this disease. Due to the growing magnitude of number of cases and its subsequent stress on the administration and health professionals, some prediction methods would be required to predict the number of cases in future. In this paper, we have used data-driven estimation methods like long short-term memory (LSTM) and curve fitting for prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases in India 30 days ahead and effect of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19. The prediction of various parameters (number of positive cases, number of recovered cases, etc.) obtained by the proposed method is accurate within a certain range and will be a beneficial tool for administrators and health officials. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sorely testing health care systems and economies around the world and is rightly considered as the major health emergency in a century. Despite the course of the disease appearing to be mild in many cases, a significant proportion of symptomatic patients develop pneumonia requiring hospitalisation or progress to manifest respiratory complications leading to intensive care treatment. Potential interventions for SARS-CoV2-associated pneumonia are being tested, some of which holding promise, but as of today none of these has yet demonstrated outstanding efficacy in treating COVID-19. In this article, we discuss fresh perspectives and insights into the potential role of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 as well as similarities with systemic inflammatory response in sepsis and the rationale for exploring novel treatment options affecting host immune response. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

The trade in wild meat, and its role in diets, have been brought into focus as a consequence of discussions over the origins of COVID-19. As a result, there have been calls for the closure of China’s “wet markets”; greater scrutiny of the wildlife trade in general; and a spotlight has been placed on the potential risks posed by growing human populations and shrinking natural habitats for animal to human transmission of zoonotic diseases. However, to date there has been little attention given to what the consequences of the COVID-19 economic shock may be for the wildlife trade; the people who rely on it for their livelihoods; and the wildlife that is exploited. In this policy perspective, we argue that the links between the COVID-19 pandemic, rural livelihoods and wildlife are likely to be more complex, more nuanced, and more far-reaching, than is represented in the literature to date. We develop a causal model that tracks the likely implications for the wild meat trade of the systemic crisis triggered by COVID-19. We focus on the resulting economic shockwave, as manifested in the collapse in global demand for commodities such as oil, and international tourism services, and what this may mean for local African economies and livelihoods. We trace the shockwave through to the consequences for the use of, and demand for, wild meats as households respond to these changes. We suggest that understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of wild meat use requires increased collaboration between environmental and resource economics and the ecological and conservation sciences. © 2020, The Author(s).

A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. Results: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures. © 2020 by the authors.

Yet, few have provided a synthesis that examines how these factors relate to each other. This article fills this gap in the debate by comparing COVID-19 responses among five advanced economies in East Asia: Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan. Although agile actions and competence of top leadership are necessary to confront an unprecedented crisis, they are by themselves insufficient. Equally critical is whether a society has the necessary institutional infrastructure in place when a crisis strikes. Policy instruments are more likely to succeed when existing institutional infrastructure supports their administration and implementation. For an instrument to generate enduring impact, it must be compatible with a polity’s underlying culture; instruments that accommodate the underlying cultural orientations are more likely to elicit public cooperation and voluntary compliance over time. Policy instruments must also address equity issues by reaching marginalized groups across all layers of the population. Progress in emergency management may be visible in mainstream society but masking brewing problems among marginalized groups. A comparison across the five advanced economies in East Asia yields several implications for comparative research and policy. © The Author(s) 2020.

Accordingly, the pandemic has been generating unprecedented disruption on practically every aspect of society. This paper demonstrates that high-frequency electricity market data can be used to estimate the causal, short-run impacts of COVID-19 on the economy, providing information that is essential for shaping future lockdown policy. Unlike official statistics, which are published with a delay of a few months, our approach permits almost real-time monitoring of the economic impact of the containment policies and the financial stimuli introduced to address the crisis. We illustrate our methodology using daily data for the Italian day-ahead power market. We estimate that the 3 weeks of most severe lockdown reduced the corresponding Italian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by roughly 30%. Such negative impacts are now progressively declining but, at the end of June 2020, GDP is still about 8.5% lower than it would have been without the outbreak. © 2020, The Author(s).

The virus has very high infectivity and is crippling in patients developing severe disease. The disease caused by this infective agent, a novel RNA coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 usually enters the human body from the respiratory tract and gradually causes systemic disease. The disease is mild in 81% and severe in the balance. The virus causes multiorgan damage and primarily damages airway epithelium, small intestine epithelium, and vascular endothelium, which are organs with high angiotensin-converting enzyme (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 [ACE2] expression). The most affected organ is the lungs, and the cardiovascular system follows it closely. Symptomatic hypoxic patients are initially treated with oxygen supplementation, but those with severe hypoxia need mechanical ventilation support. Patients with COVID-19 infection present as two phenotypes. The ventilation strategy should be based on the phenotype. The disease causes major hemodynamic disturbances in its invasion of the cardiovascular system. Strict personal protection protocols are needed to ensure the safety of health-care workers and nosocomial spread. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.

The current crisis is so severe that we should not take the answer for granted. It requires serious thought and we start by reviewing some arguments for and against a green approach. A crucial element is of course to see how different industries fare in the current crisis. Our empirical contribution is to examine daily stock returns for firms from the STOXX Europe 600 index. We find that firms with higher carbon intensities experienced significantly large decreases in stock values particularly those within the crude petroleum extraction, air transport and coke and refined petroleum industries. Our tentative conclusion is that efforts to revitalize the economy should avoid subsidizing stranded assets and instead target the industries of the future. However, identifying these will not necessarily be easy. We find, for example, that having an official ESG “climate change policy” has no effect on firm performance during the pandemic. We suggest possible ways of designing a new form of more informative index. © 2020, The Author(s).

From the beginning of the outbreak to now, there have been many mathematical models proposed to describe the spread of the pandemic, and most of them are established with the assumption that people contact with each other in a homogeneous pattern. However, owing to the difference of individuals in reality, social contact is usually heterogeneous, and the models on homogeneous networks cannot accurately describe the outbreak. Thus, we propose a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model on social networks to describe the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. Then, according to the results of the simulations, we discover that the measures that can curb the spread of COVID-19 include increasing the recovery rate and the removed rate, cutting off connections between symptomatically infected individuals and their neighbours, and cutting off connections between hub nodes and their neighbours. The feasible measures proposed in the paper are in fair agreement with the measures that the government took to suppress the outbreak. Furthermore, effective measures should be carried out immediately, otherwise the pandemic would spread more rapidly and last longer. In addition, we use the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2 to analyse the outbreak in the city and explain why the number of the infected rose in the early stage of the outbreak though a total lockdown was implemented. Moreover, besides the above measures, a feasible way to curb the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the density of social networks, such as restricting mobility and decreasing in-person social contacts. This work provides a series of effective measures, which can facilitate the selection of appropriate approaches for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its adverse impact on people’s livelihood, societies and economies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Most countries are enforcing strict quarantine to control the havoc of this highly contagious disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many data analyses have been done to provide close support to decision-makers. We propose a method comprising data analytics and machine learning classification for evaluating the effectiveness of lockdown regulations. Lockdown regulations should be reviewed on a regular basis by governments, to enable reasonable control over the outbreak. The model aims to measure the efficiency of lockdown procedures for various countries. The model shows a direct correlation between lockdown procedures and the infection rate. Lockdown efficiency is measured by finding a correlation coefficient between lockdown attributes and the infection rate. The lockdown attributes include retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, residential, and schools. Our results show that combining all the independent attributes in our study resulted in a higher correlation (0.68) to the dependent value Interquartile 3 (Q3). Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was found to be the least value when combining all attributes. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

For example, the extent to which social media platforms contribute to enhancing public health awareness and prevention during epidemic disease transmission is currently unknown. Doubtlessly, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents a great challenge at the global level, aggressively affecting large cities and public gatherings and thereby having substantial impacts on many health care systems worldwide as a result of its rapid spread. Each country has its capacity and reacts according to its perception of threat, economy, health care policy, and the health care system structure. Furthermore, we noted a lack of research focusing on the role of social media campaigns in public health awareness and public protection against the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan as a developing country. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of social media platforms on public health protection against the COVID-19 pandemic via public health awareness and public health behavioral changes as mediating factors in Jordan. Methods: A quantitative approach and several social media platforms were used to collect data via web questionnaires in Jordan, and a total of 2555 social media users were sampled. This study used structural equation modeling to analyze and verify the study variables. Results: The main findings revealed that the use of social media platforms had a significant positive influence on public health protection against COVID-19 as a pandemic. Public health awareness and public health behavioral changes significantly acted as partial mediators in this relationship. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of the use of social media interventions on public health protection against COVID-19 while taking public health awareness and behavioral changes into account as mediators should be helpful when developing any health promotion strategy plan. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the use of social media platforms can positively influence awareness of public health behavioral changes and public protection against COVID-19. Public health authorities may use social media platforms as an effective tool to increase public health awareness through dissemination of brief messages to targeted populations.

It seems unavoidable that this natural disruption has hit the global economy and produced a huge crisis for firms. This study explores how firms in China are innovating their marketing strategies by critically identifying the typology of firms’ marketing innovations using two dimensions, namely, motivation for innovations and the level of collaborative innovations. This research also explores the influence of the external environment, internal advantages (e.g., dynamic capabilities and resource dependence), and characteristics of firms on Chinese firms’ choice and implementation of marketing innovation strategies. It provides valuable insights for firms to respond successfully to similar crisis events in the future. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Effects on psychology, environment and economy-perspective COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on unconstrained (r = −0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob > .0203 with 49 observations) and based on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown. The application of lockdown by governments is also thought to be effective on psychology, environment and economy besides having impact on Covid-19. © 2020 The Author Correlation; COVID-19; Economy; Environment; Lockdown; Psychology air quality; Article; carbon footprint; coronavirus disease 2019; correlation analysis; cumulative scale; descriptive research; economic aspect; economic evaluation; environment; environmental factor; food intake; human; infection prevention; major clinical study; mental disease; mental health; mortality rate; pandemic; priority journal; psychology; quarantine; remote sensing; social behavior; social isolation; social status; statistical analysis; time series analysis; water quality Orthopaedic surgery after COVID-19 – A blueprint for resuming elective surgery after a pandemic Background: The COVID-19 outbreak was fraught with danger and despair as many medically necessary surgeries were cancelled to preserve precious healthcare resources and mitigate disease transmission. As the rate of infection starts to slow, healthcare facilities and economies attempt to return to normalcy in a graduated manner and the massive pent-up demand for surgeries needs to eventually be addressed in a systematic and equitable manner. Materials and methods: Guidelines from the Alliance of International Organizations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Orthopaedic Trauma Association, American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anaesthesiologists, Association of perioperative Registered Nurses, American Hospital Association, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were evaluated and summarized into a working framework, relevant to orthopaedic surgeons. Results: The guiding principles for restarting elective surgeries in a safe and acceptable manner include up-to-date disease awareness, projection and judicious management of equipment and facilities, effective human resource management, a fair and transparent system to prioritize cases, optimization of peri-operative workflows and continuous data gathering and clinical governance. Conclusion: The world was ill prepared for the initial COVID-19 outbreak. However, with effective forward planning, institutions can ramp-up elective surgical caseload in a safe and equitable manner. © 2020 IJS Publishing Group Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Elective surgery; Orthopaedic surgery; Pandemic anesthesiologist; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; elective surgery; health care facility; health workforce; human; international organization; medicaid; medical society; medicare; orthopedic surgeon; orthopedic surgery; pandemic; perioperative period; practice guideline; priority journal; public health service; registered nurse; resource management; Review; traumatology; World Health Organization; anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; organization and management; orthopedic surgery; orthopedics; perioperative nursing; personnel management; procedures; United States; virus pneumonia; workflow; American Hospital Association; Anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Medicare; Orthopedic Procedures; Orthopedics; Pandemics; Perioperative Nursing; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Societies, Medical; Traumatology; United States; Workflow; World Health Organization Infertility and reproductive rights after the COVID-19 pandemic Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, halting the principal income activities worldwide. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the imminent economic recession will be worse than the global financial crisis of 2008, which severely affected the economy of Southern European countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain. There was then an abysmal drop in the Spanish yearly population growth curve as families could not afford to have children in that economic context; this only worsened the already existing demographic problems in that Spain has a constantly ageing population and one of the lowest fertility indicators in Europe. Taking into consideration that female age is the most important independent variable of success at the time of conception, probably thousands of potentially fertile couples were lost while waiting for more promising circumstances. With the COVID-19 pandemic a similar situation is being faced, where reproductive rights are imperiled by not being able to choose when to have children due to economic coercion. Therefore, governments worldwide should take measures to palliate the possible sociodemographic crisis that will follow the economic recession and try to ease the burden that many families might face during the following years. © 2020 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

As of June 26, 2020, over 9.4 million cases of infection, including 482,730 deaths, had been confirmed across 216 countries. To combat a devastating virus pandemic, numerous studies on vaccine development are urgently being accelerated. In this review article, we take a brief look at the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoVs and discuss recent approaches to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development. © 2020.

However, if you are a graduating trainee confronted with this unusual set of circumstances, fear of the virus is not the only thing that is foremost in your mind. We discuss the unique challenges our pain fellowship program continues to deal with during this pandemic and particularly its impact on our fellows. It is entirely likely these concerns are mirrored in academic programs all over the United States. © 2020, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. All rights reserved.

As the world is struggling to minimize the transmission of this devastating disease, several strategies are being actively deployed to develop therapeutic interventions. Pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers are relentlessly working to investigate experimental, repurposed or FDA-approved drugs on a compassionate basis and novel biologics for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and treatment. Presently, a tremendous surge of COVID-19 clinical trials are advancing through different stages. Among currently registered clinical efforts, ~86% are centered on testing small molecules or antibodies either alone or in combination with immunomodulators. The rest ~14% of clinical efforts are aimed at evaluating vaccines and convalescent plasma-based therapies to mitigate the disease's symptoms. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic modalities being evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The banking sector is no exception, which is facing multitude of challenges. Some of the challenges are generic in nature like contraction of demand for products and services, restriction in mobility, logistics, and even sustainability in the present scenario. Some of these are sector specific, like the banking sector is facing a number of challenges with regard to operations, asset quality, and earnings to name a few. National Bank, which recently successfully handled the merger of Sagar Bank Ltd. in its fold, faced another big challenge in the form of this pandemic. Apart from the generic challenges mentioned above, National Bank is confronted with other challenges like employee morale, liquidity, and vendor management. Management of National Bank realized that it has to formulate specific strategies in order to deal with the circumstances arising on account of this pandemic. The management, being fully aware of the bank's weaknesses and looking into the threats posed by this pandemic, wanted to devise strategies catering to the circumstances. The CMD (Chairman & Managing Director) of National Bank elicited feedback of all CGMs (Chief General Managers) for dealing with the ramifications of this pandemic. The senior management soon realized that it has to act swiftly in order to minimize the impact of this pandemic on the bank. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd.. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, the negative local impacts of the pandemic will be particularly harsh for those parts of South Africa where tourism is a critical sector in the local economy. The objective in this article is to identify the tourism spaces of vulnerability in South Africa. Use is made of the IHS Global Insight data base for 2016 to analyse at a local authority scale the most vulnerable localities to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indicators used to isolate tourism spaces of vulnerability are total tourism spend; tourism spend as a proportion of local GDP; domestic and international tourism (trips and bednights); and, leisure, business and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travel. The analysis discloses those local authorities that are the most vulnerable to the downturn/collapse of tourism as a whole as well as to the hollowing out of specific forms of tourism, namely domestic as opposed to international travel, leisure as opposed to business or VFR travel. © 2020 AJHTL /Author(s).

Barring the essential services, most of the business activities and transport sectors have been suspended and an unprecedented lockdown imposed over major economies in the world. South-East Asian regions, such as India and China, were no different. As a result, the pollutant level has gone down over these regions, and the air quality improved somewhat better than it was before the lockdown. This study uses satellite retrievals and attempts to estimate the extent of the reduction of major pollutants, like carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in India and China during January to April, 2020. We have calculated anomalies of pollutants during the lockdown period relative to their long-term records. NO2, which has significant emissions from the transport sector, is reduced on an average by 17% over India and 25% over China. SO2, which mainly emits from power plants, shows significant reductions (approx. 17%) especially over the Eastern sector of India. CO is found to be reduced by 6.5% over north-central China. The differential reduction was attributed to man made versus natural activities. This study is helpful to policy makers in mitigating the air-pollution on a long-term perspective. © The Author(s).

The proposed primary culprit of COVID-19 is the intense inflammatory response—an augmented immune response and cytokine storm—severely damaging the lung tissue and rendering some patients’ conditions severe enough to require assisted ventilation. Sex differences in the response to inflammation have been documented and can be attributed, at least in part, to sex steroid hormones. Moreover, age-associated decreases in sex steroid hormones, namely, estrogen and testosterone, may mediate proinflammatory increases in older adults that could increase their risk of COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Sex hormones can mitigate the inflammation response and might provide promising therapeutic potential for patients with COVID-19. In this article, we explore the possible anti-inflammatory effects of estrogen and testosterone and the anabolic effect of testosterone, with particular attention to the potential therapeutic role of hormone replacement therapy in older men and women with COVID-19. © 2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research  angiotensin converting enzyme 2; C reactive protein; estrogen; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; sex hormone; testosterone; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor; antiinflammatory agent; estrogen; testosterone; case fatality rate; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine production; disease severity; high risk population; hormone substitution; human; immune response; intensive care unit; lymphocytopenia; mortality; pathophysiology; postmenopause; protein expression; public health; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sex difference; virus load; vulnerable population; age; aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; female; inflammation; male; pandemic; pathophysiology; physiology; very elderly; virology; virus pneumonia; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Estrogens; Female; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Testosterone Using the kalman filter with Arima for the COVID-19 pandemic dataset of Pakistan The current pandemic of the Novel Corona virus (COVID-19) has resulted in multifold challenges related to health, economy, and society, etc. for the entire world. Many mathematical epidemiological models have been tried for the available data of the COVID-19 pandemic with the core objective to observe the trend and trajectories of infected cases, recoveries, and deaths, etc. However, these models have their own assumptions and parameters and vary with regional demography. This article suggests the use of a more pragmatic approach of the Kalman filter with the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models in order to obtain more precise forecasts for the figures of prevalence, active cases, recoveries, and deaths related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. © 2020 The Author(s) Arima model; COVID-2019 pandemic; Forecast; Holt-winters’ method; Infection control; Kalman filter; State space model; SutteARIMA  COVID-19 and kidney diseases in Indonesia At the end of 2019, flu-like illness and pneumonia with an unknown cause first appeared in China. Later it is identified as Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) This life-threatening disease spreads fastly worldwide and makes some disturbances in the health system, economy, and society. It affects many organs, especially the respiratory tract. Kidney involvement presents a lot of patients and increases morbidity and mortality. A recent study showed that abnormal kidney function was related to death in patients with COVID-19. This complication should be considered to prevent the worsening of the disease. The immune system plays a major role in this pathogenesis of disease and kidney problems. In this difficult situation, understanding COVID-19 and kidney diseases will help us to get proper management and prevention to solve the problem. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

Assessment of healthcare workers' levels of preparedness and awareness regarding Covid-19 infection in low-resource settings COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is spreading rapidly worldwide, with devastating consequences for patients, healthcare workers, health systems, and economies. As it reaches low- and middle-income countries, the pandemic puts healthcare workers at high risk and challenges the abilities of healthcare systems to respond to the crisis. This study measured levels of knowledge and preparedness regarding COVID-19 among physicians and nurses. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among healthcare workers in Libya between February 26 and March 10, 2020. We obtained 1,572 valid responses of a possible 2,000 (78.6%) participants from 21 hospitals, of which 65.1% were from physicians and 34.9% from nurses. The majority of participants (70%) used social media as a source of information. A total of 47.3% of doctors and 54.7% of nurses received adequate training on how to effectively use personal protective equipment. Low confidence in managing suspected COVID-19 patients was reported by 83.8% of participants. Furthermore, 43.2% of healthcare workers were aware of proper hand hygiene techniques. Less than 7% of participants received training on how to manage COVID-19 cases, whereas 20.6% of doctors and 26.3% of nurses felt that they were personally prepared for the outbreak. Awareness and preparedness for the pandemic were low among frontline workers during the study. Therefore, an effective educational training program should be implemented to ensure maintenance of appropriate practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Not only is the infection inflicting significant morbidity and mortality, but there has also been a significant strain to the health care system and the economy. COVID-19 typically presents as viral pneumonia, occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. However, emerging evidence suggests that it has a significant impact on the cardiovascular (CV) system by direct myocardial damage, severe systemic inflammatory response, hypoxia, right heart strain secondary to ARDS and lung injury, and plaque rupture secondary to inflammation. Primary cardiac manifestations include acute myocarditis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and abnormal clotting. Several consensus documents have been released to help manage CV disease during this pandemic. In this review, we summarize key cardiac manifestations, their management, and future implications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.  antihypertensive agent; chloroquine; corticosteroid; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; immunomodulating agent; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; remdesivir; ribavirin; tocilizumab; adverse outcome; artificial ventilation; atrioventricular block; brain hemorrhage; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular effect; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; deep vein thrombosis; drug use; electrolyte disturbance; extracorporeal oxygenation; heart arrhythmia; heart bundle branch block; heart disease; heart infarction; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart muscle injury; heart muscle ischemia; heart output; heart ventricle arrhythmia; hemolytic anemia; human; hypertension; immunotherapy; intracranial hypertension; ischemia; lung embolism; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; QT prolongation; QTc prolongation; respiratory alkalosis; Review; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; torsade des pointes; transfusion related acute lung injury; venous thromboembolism; cardiovascular disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; myocarditis; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Myocarditis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral COVID-19: Unique public health issues facing Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities The 2019 coronavirus disease is a serious public health emergency, with serious adverse implications for populations, healthcare systems, and economies globally. Recently, concerns have been raised about possible association between ethnicity, incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 arisen from early government data. In this review, we will explore the possible association using both recent COVID-19 studies and studies of previous pandemics. We call for data on ethnicity to be routinely collected by governments, as part of an international collaboration, alongside other patient demographics and further research to robustly determine the magnitude of association. Moreover, governments must learn from previous pandemics and recommended strategies to mitigate risks on minority ethnicities due to socioeconomic disadvantages. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.  vitamin D; ACE2 gene; adaptive immunity; Asian; attitude to health; BCG vaccination; Black person; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; cellular immunity; coronary artery disease; coronavirus disease 2019; cultural factor; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease predisposition; disease severity; ethnic group; gene; genetic polymorphism; genetic predisposition; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; government; health care policy; high risk population; human; hypertension; incidence; innate immunity; kidney disease; lifestyle; lung function; oxidative stress; pandemic; public health; quantitative trait locus; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; social status; socioeconomics; vitamin blood level; vitamin D deficiency; Asian continental ancestry group; Betacoronavirus; Black person; Coronavirus infection; ethnic group; ethnology; health care disparity; incidence; international cooperation; isolation and purification; minority health; organization and management; pandemic; virus pneumonia; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Ethnic Groups; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Incidence; International Cooperation; Minority Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors Trump, COVID-19, and the War on Expertise In times of crisis, the American public looks to the president for leadership that will usher the country successfully to the other side of troubled times. There is a long history of presidential actions to lead the nation successfully through times of crisis. Abraham Lincoln’s leadership during the Civil War preserved the Union, just as Franklin Roosevelt’s leadership during both the Great Depression and World War II restored the nation toward a future of peace and prosperity defeating threats to both the economy and security at home and abroad. Currently, the public looks to President Donald Trump for leadership through the COVID-19 global pandemic, which is presenting a direct threat to the health and economic security of the nation. This article will examine the leadership of Donald Trump throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the focus will be on Donald Trump’s relationship with advisors and the extent to which he is using their shared expertise both for informing the public and in crafting policy responses to COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2020. bureaucracy; crisis management; expertise; presidency  Greening the Post-pandemic Recovery in the G20 Rebuilding G20 economies after the COVID-19 pandemic requires rethinking what type of economy we need and want in the future. Simply reviving the existing ‘brown’ economy will exacerbate irreversible climate change and other environmental risks. For G20 economies, investing in a workable and affordable green transition is essential. A good place to start is learning what worked and what did not from previous efforts to green the economic recovery during the 2008–2009 Great Recession, examining the cases of the United States and South Korea. Policies for a sustained economic recovery amount to much more than just short-term fiscal stimulus. Transitioning from fossil fuels to a sustainable low-carbon economy will require long-term commitments (5–10 years) of public spending and pricing reforms. The priorities for public spending include support for private sector green innovation and infrastructure, development of smart grids, transport systems, charging station networks, and sustainable cities. Pricing carbon and pollution, and removing fossil-fuel subsidies, can accelerate the transition, raise revenues for the necessary public investments, and lower the overall cost of the green transition. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of these measures in the short and long term. We use a Computable General Equilibrium model designed to assess environmental and energy policies impacts at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. We find that the lockdown has led to a significant decrease in economic output of 5% of GDP, but a positive environmental impact with a 6.6% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020. Both decreases are temporary: economic and environmental indicators return to their baseline trajectory after a few years. CO2 emissions even end up significantly higher after the COVID-19 crisis when we account for persistently low oil prices. We then investigate whether implementing carbon pricing can still yield positive macroeconomic dividends in the post-COVID recovery. We find that implementing ambitious carbon pricing speeds up economic recovery while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. By maintaining high fossil fuel prices, carbon taxation reduces the imports of fossil energy and stimulates energy efficiency investments while the full redistribution of tax proceeds does not hamper the recovery. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The crisis, named the ""2020 crisis"", is notable for the divergence of the sectoral dynamics of development, with a declining development trend in some industries and the rapid growth of others. The crisis is etymologically relevant to the energy sector, a sector which is important for the survival and specialization of the Russian Federation. This research is aimed at describing the status and highlighting the socioeconomic effects, constraints (economic and social risks), and ""growth points"" of the energy sector in the modern realities of the 2020 crisis. Methods. The method of in-depth interview was used. The need for studying expert opinion is based on the fundamental principles of implementation research, according to which the success of state sectoral policy depends on its perception and support by stakeholders. Top managers of energy enterprises acted as the experts (N = 10). The interviews were conducted in April 2020. The method of incremental approximation and coding (open and axial) were used for a high-quality discourse analysis. Results. The conducted study revealed divergence of sectoral dynamics of energy consumption, which is a translation of the immanent features of the 2020 crisis into the energy sector. The detected constraints are reserved development prerequisites of ""green energy"" and reduced investments in development programs. The potential ""growth points"" include intensified digitalization of the energy sector and the need for institutional changes in taxation in the energy sector, recognized by experts. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper addresses the complex and partly contradictory responses to these two crises, investigating their social anatomies. Using temporality, spatiality, and epistemic authority as the main conceptual vehicles, the two crises are systematically compared. Despite sharing a number of similarities, the most striking difference between the two crises is the urgency of action to counter the rapid spread of the pandemic as compared to the slow and meager action to mitigate longstanding, well-documented, and accelerating climate change. Although the tide now seems to have turned towards a quick and massive effort to restore the status quo-including attempts to restart the existing economic growth models, which imply an obvious risk for substantially increasing CO2 emissions-the article finally points at some signs of an opening window of opportunity for green growth and degrowth initiatives. However, these signs have to be realistically interpreted in relation to the broader context of power relations in terms of governance configurations and regulatory strategies worldwide at different levels of society. © 2020 by the authors.

In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies. © 2020 Li et al.

Despite the severity of some cases, there are no current pathogen-specific antivirals available to treat the disease. Therefore, many studies have focused on the evaluation of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of clinically available drugs. Here, we conducted a systematic review to describe the drug repositioning strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and to discuss the clinical impact of this approach in the current pandemic context. The systematic review was performed on March 23, 2020, using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Biblioteca Virtual de Saúde (BVS). The data were summarized in tables and critically analyzed. After the database search, 12 relevant studies were identified as eligible for the review. Among the drugs reported in these studies, 57 showed some evidence of antiviral activity. Antivirals, especially antiretrovirals, are the main class of therapeutic agents evaluated against COVID-19. Moreover, studies have reported the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of antitumor (16%; 9/57), antimalarial (7%, 4/57), and antibacterial (5%; 3/57) agents. Additionally, seven pharmacological agents (chloroquine, tetrandrine, umifenovir (arbidol), carrimycin, damageprevir, lopinavir/ritonavir) are in phase IV of clinical trials. Due to the evidence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of various clinically available agents, drug repositioning stands out as a promising strategy for a short-term response in the fight against the novel coronavirus. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.  antiinfective agent; antimalarial agent; antineoplastic agent; antiretrovirus agent; antivirus agent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Antimalarials; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Elements of sustainable development in the context of the environmental and financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic Sustainable development is the need of the hour today. For over three decades, since the term was used in public little has been done about it. Such important activities for the protection of our ecosystem have been mainly discussed at scientific conferences or in the comfort of academic lecture halls. Successive global crises, especially the ecological, economic, financial and now humanitarian one related to the COVID-19 pandemic have demolished global economies, sidelined the development of a sustainable economy and especially sustainable construction, treating it more as a whim of the rich than expedience. The construction sector accounts for up to 40 per cent of the global carbon dioxide emissions and generates more than 0.5 billion tonnes of waste every year. However, when it comes to improving macroeconomic indicators after another crisis, the easiest way to look for savings is to use the production of emerging markets, without considering their lower economic and environmental awareness. Each time, the lust for profit prevailed over environmental protection. Education, business, and institutional factors failed, as indicated in the conclusions. That was the case until November 17, 2019, when the first man was infected with the coronavirus. Will we draw the right conclusions from that while facing a crisis unprecedented in human history? Can we change priorities from having to being? © 2020 by the author.

Although at a global level, such persecution is relatively uncommon, even a few misguided actions have the potential to cause irrevocable damage to already vulnerable species. Here, we draw on the latest findings from psychology, to explain why some conservation messaging may be reinforcing misleading negative associations. We provide guidelines to help ensure that conservation messaging is working to neutralize dangerous and unwarranted negative-associations between bats and disease-risk. We provide recommendations around three key areas of psychological science: (i) debunking misinformation; (ii) counteracting negative associations; and (iii) changing harmful social norms. We argue that only by carefully framing accurate, honest, and duly contextualized information, will we be able to best serve society and present an unbiased perspective of bats. We hope this guidance will help conservation practitioners and researchers to develop effective message framing strategies that minimize zoonotic health risks and support biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Behavioural change; Conservation communication; Conservation psychology; Human-wildlife conflict; Message framing; Zoonoses bat; biodiversity; conservation planning; disease spread; ecosystem service; guideline; health risk; psychology; public health Green tax reform in Australia in the presence of improved environment-induced productivity gain: Does it offer sustainable recovery from a Post-COVID-19 recession? Disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19 will change the world in many ways and the road to redemption from the ongoing economic distress may require a novel approach. This paper proposes a path towards economic recovery that keeps sustainability at the forefront. A computable general equilibrium model is used to simulate different green tax reform (GTR) policies for triple dividend (TD), consisting of lower emissions, higher GDP and higher employment. The GTR design consists of an energy tax coupled with one of three tax revenue recycle methods: (i) reduction of payroll tax, (ii) reduction of goods and services tax (GST) and (iii) a mixed-recycling approach. The paper also presents the impact of higher productivity on the tax reform simulations, which is a possible positive externality of lower emissions. The study is based on the Australian economy and the salient findings are twofold: (i) productivity gain in the GTR context improves the GDP and employment outcomes in all three different simulation scenarios and (ii) GST reduction has the highest TD potential, followed by reduction of payroll tax. © 2020 by the authors.

It is not important in which sector it operates, whether it is a private or public one, but profits and safety are two elements every enterprise is not able to function without. The low performance of these two measures can cause a number of difficulties for managers. To avoid this, leading companies, especially the smallest ones, should optimize the trade credit management policy. Most often, SMEs' (small and medium-sized enterprises) owners try to work together as part of a group purchasing organization, which positively affects trade credit management. The aim of the paper is to present the trade credit management strategy in Polish group purchasing organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses data on the construction sector because it is one of the most important segments of the Polish economy, which is financed to a large extent with trade credit. The paper indicates the mechanisms whose applications allowed SMEs operating in purchasing groups to change trade credit management strategies in such a way that these units could operate calmly and safely in the market. These changes could be observed in purchasing goods with a large reserve, strictly controlling all receivables, switching to cash sales or limiting sales on long-term trade credit. The analysis showed that enterprises changed trade credit management strategies from moderately conservative to highly conservative. © 2020 by the authors.

During and after the crisis, there are opportunities and needs for remote work facilities, online services, delivery drones, etc. We discuss how unmanned technologies can cause a long-term employment decrease, and why compensation mechanisms may not work. Using the internationally comparable Frey–Osborne methodology, we estimated that less than a third of employees in Russia work in professions with a high automation probability. Some of these professions can suffer the most during quarantine measures; employment in traditional services can be significantly reduced. By 2030, about half of the jobs in the world and a little less in Russia will need to adapt during the fourth industrial revolution because they are engaged in routine, potentially automated activities. In the regions, specializing in manufacturing, this value is higher; the lowest risk is in the largest agglomerations with a high share of digital economy, greater and diverse labour markets. Accelerating technological change can lead to a long-term mismatch between the exponential increase in automation rate and compensating effects of retraining, new jobs creation and other labour market adaptation mechanisms. Some people will not be ready for a life-long learning and competition with robots, and accordingly there is a possibility of their technological exclusion. The term “nescience economy” and corresponding assessment method were proposed. Using an econometric model, we identified factors that reduce these risks: human capital concentration, favourable business climate, high quality of life and ICT development. Based on these factors, some recommendations for authorities were proposed in the conclusion. © 2020 The Author(s).

Yet little research provides evidence of the effectiveness of a green stimulus. We begin by summarizing recent research on the effectiveness of the green portion of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act on employment growth. Green investments are most effective in communities whose workers have the appropriate “green” skills. We then provide new evidence on the skills requirements of both green and brown occupations, as well as from occupations at risk of job losses due to COVID-19, to illustrate which workers are most likely to benefit from a pandemic-related green stimulus. We find similarities between some energy sector workers and green jobs, but a poor match between green jobs and occupations at risk due to COVID-19. Finally, we provide suggestive evidence on the potential for job training programs to help ease the transition to a green economy. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

We stress that continuous growth of consumption activities, capital accumulation and climate change could increase the potential of the epidemic, its contact number or the probability of its arrival. This framework of analysis allows us to think of infectious disease policies in two stages. In the short run, containment policies like social distancing could help to stop the epidemic. In the medium and the long run, economic policies could help to reduce the potential of the epidemic or the probability of its emergence. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here, we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of ~20μM, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2 to 3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3 2B4 [referred to here as ""Calu-3""]) were treated. Time-of-addition and plaque reduction assays performed on Vero E6 cells showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing binding or entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest that it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires safety studies and well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.

The global coronavirus pandemic which has already caused unprecedented damage and misery has put an almost complete halt to our way of life. The epidemic will have significant and enduring economic and social implications in every corner of the globe. Only through successful cooperation and coordination between scientists, experts, innovators and policymakers can we solve the COVID-19 pandemic. Sharing observations and perspectives in real time will be crucial to improving the connection between research , policy and community, and leading to the solutions we need. When the Covid-19 pandemic is under control, and the world economy is back on track, it is important to reassess the status and fate of the 2030 Agenda, also known as Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs). The Decade of Operation was scheduled to kick-off the year 2020. With only 10 years to go, plans have been made to undertake 'ambitious global efforts' to deliver the promise of 2030-by mobilizing more governments, civil society, businesses, and calling on all people to make their own the Global Goals. © 2020 Medknow.

This has been proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests subject to evaluation. A retrospective validation study was conducted including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and clinical performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin® detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun®, one of the first commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. The performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided ""real world""analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit. Comparison between the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 and the ELISA method did not reveal any difference between the two techniques in terms of sensitivities and specificities regarding the determination of the IgG. This study reports the validation of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2. The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

It is a rapidly spreading virus that has poses a significant public threat and is a considerable burden on the global economy and human health. Objective: We characterized the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), membrane protein (M), and envelope protein (E) genes of Indonesian isolates to investigate genetic composition, predict B-cell epitopes, and construct a molecular phylogenetic tree. Methods: In the present work, we retrieved the sequences of 16 Indonesian isolates from the GISAID EpiCoV and the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (reference sequence) from GenBank, NCBI. We used MEGA X to identify mutations in the three structural protein genes and to construct a molecular phylogenetic tree. The IEDB was employed to reveal the linear B-cell epitopes and other parameters. Allergenicity prediction was evaluated using AllerTOP and ToxinPred was performed to analyze non-toxic antigen prediction. Results: In this study, we report the genetic composition of three structural protein genes in Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Furthermore, we identified the peptide RRGPEQTQGNFGDQELIRQGTDYK from nucleocapsid phosphoprotein to generate a peptide-based vaccine contrary to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: In summary, we propose a candidate for a peptide-based vaccine contrary to SARS-CoV-2. However, advance trials such as in vitro and in vivo testing are involved for validation. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies. All rights reserved.

On April 20, 2020, World Health Organization(WHO) reported more than 2.2 million confirmed cases and 150000 deaths from a novel coronavirus (Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19; strain SARS-CoV-2). According to a macroeconomic forecast from Standard & Poor's Global Ratings, the global GDP will fall 2.4% this year, and the economic impact of COVID-19 is sure to be far-reaching. It is suspected that COVID-19 has a wildlife origin. Indeed, most emerging human infectious diseases, such as SARS, Ebola, and H1N1, originate in animals. However, animals that host infectious diseases not only play critical roles in disease transmission, control, and prevention, but also serve the basis for the maintenance and stability of natural ecosystems. Although the COVID-19 and other epidemic diseases remind us that information on animals and their pathogenic microbes is necessary to control the spread of zoonotic diseases before they turn into epidemics or pandemics, we have little knowledge on the behavior, ecology, life history, and the pathology of infected animals. Therefore, comprehensive and solid research should be performed on animals that carry pathogens (e.g., viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, and prions). We searched published articles on infectious, endemic, and epidemic diseases in the Web of Science database and found that only 11.75% of articles (2930727 in total) were in the field of zoology. In contrast, more than half of the articles were in infectious diseases (biomedicine). Chinese researchers have published 221105 papers, 26.72% of the output of the United States. Even in the field of zoology, the US has published 86233 articles (2.83 times more than Chinese researchers). As solutions to the challenges of zoonotic epidemics require a public and comprehensive approach, we propose to develop a Convergence Science approach (transdisciplinary science) to study high-risk animals responsible for zoonotic epidemics. It aims to answer and resolve basic but essential questions. For example, what is the biological background of these animals, and how many ways can zoonotic diseases spillover? This effort is not limited to species classification, biological characters, evolutionary footprints, hosted microbes, behavior, and spillover approaches, nor field investigation, genetics, molecular biology, physiological, microbiology, mathematics, management, and veterinary medicine/science. While we appreciate the efforts of the medical research community to develop vaccines and medications to mitigate the spread of emerging diseases and to reduce human mortality rates, we argue that generating a dynamic list of pathogenic microbes and their wildlife hosts also represents an urgent and critical tool in ecological epidemiology. We call for a global and cooperative effort to create, maintain, and update this information in order to reduce the severity of future pandemics. A Convergence Science approach to the study of animals that host potential infectious diseases may allow the prediction and prevention of zoonotic epidemics, reduce or ablate the risk of zoonotic infection, and ensure biosecurity and public health. © 2020, Science Press.

One key requirement to safely transition out of lockdown is the continuous testing of the population to identify infected subjects. Currently, detection is performed at points of care using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, thus requiring dedicated professionals and equipment. Here, we developed a protocol based on reverse transcribed loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. This protocol is applied directly to SARS-CoV-2 nose and throat swabs, with no RNA purification step required. We tested this protocol on over 180 suspected patients, and compared the results to those obtained using the standard method. We further succeeded in applying the protocol to self-collected saliva samples from confirmed cases. Since the proposed protocol can detect SARS-CoV-2 from saliva and provides on-the-spot results, it allows simple and continuous surveillance of the community. Impact statement: Humanity is currently experiencing a global pandemic with devastating implications on human health and the economy. Most countries are gradually exiting their lockdown state. We are currently lacking rapid and simple viral detections, especially methods that can be performed in the household. Here, we applied RT-LAMP directly on human clinical swabs and self-collected saliva samples. We adjusted the method to allow simple and rapid viral detection, with no RNA purification steps. By testing our method on over 180 human samples, we determined its sensitivity, and by applying it to other viruses, we determined its specificity. We believe this method has a promising potential to be applied world-wide as a simple and cheap surveillance test for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

At present, the development of supply chain finance is facing an important point: The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has a wide impact on the global economy, which not only generates the strong demand for supply chain finance, but also brings new uncertainty. At the same time, the accelerated development of Fintech provides more possibilities and tools for supply chain finance model innovation and risk management. This paper summarizes the current situation of supply chain finance from two aspects of practical development and theoretical research, and analyzes its future development trend. First of all, the practical development of supply chain finance is sorted out and divided into four stages for analysis. Secondly, with the help of bibliometrics tools, this paper analyzes and compares English and Chinese literature, and summarizes the theoretical research status from three aspects: Theoretical basis, optimization decision-making and risk management. Finally, there are three development trends of supply chain finance in the future, that is, the formation of healthy network ecosystem is an important basis for the development of supply chain finance, the adoption of modern Fintech enabling is a powerful tool for the development of supply chain finance, and bearing the social responsibility of sustainable development is the long-term goal of supply chain finance development. Meanwhile, it gives five key research issues that deserve attention. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China. All right reserved.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality workforce in situ between mid-April and June 2020. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper that brings together a variety of sources and intelligence relating the impacts on hospitality work of the COVID-19 pandemic at three levels: macro (global, policy, government), meso (organisational) and micro (employee). It questions whether the situations faced by hospitality workers as a result of the pandemic are seed-change different from the precarious lives they normally lead or just a (loud) amplification of the “normal”. Findings: In light of the fluid environment relating to COVID-19, conclusions are tentative and question whether hospitality stakeholders, particularly consumers, governments and the industry itself, will emerge from the pandemic with changed attitudes to hospitality work and hospitality workers. Practical implications: This raises questions about hospitality work for key stakeholders to address in the future, some of which are systemic in terms of how precarious labour forces, critical to the global economy are to be considered by policy makers, organisations in a re-emerging competitive market for talent and for those who chose (or not) to work in hospitality. Social implications: This paper contributes to ongoing debates about precarious work and the extent to which such practices are institutionalised and adopts an “amplification model” that may have value in futures-orientated analysis about hospitality and tourism. Originality/value: This paper is wholly original and a reflection on the COVID-19 crisis. It provides a point of wider reference with regard to responses to crises and their impact on employment in hospitality, highlighting how ongoing change, fluidity and uncertainty serve to magnify and exacerbate the precarious nature of work in the industry. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

At the same time, laboratories and institutions are working hard to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, which we hope will be available soon. However, there has been no assessment of whether an individual and society value ​​a vaccine monetarily, and what factors determine this value. Therefore, the objective of this research was to estimate the individual's willingness to pay (WTP) for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine and, at the same time, find the main factors that determine this valuation. For this, we used the contingent valuation approach, in its single and double-bounded dichotomous choice format, which was based on a hypothetical market for a vaccine. The sample used was obtained through an online survey of n = 566 individuals from Chile. The main results showed that the WTP depends on the preexistence of chronic disease (p≤0.05), knowledge of COVID-19 (p≤0.05), being sick with COVID-19 (p≤0.05), perception of government performance (p≤0.01), employment status (p≤0.01), income (p≤0.01), health care (p≤0.05), adaptation to quarantine with children at home (p≤0.01) and whether the person has recovered from COVID-19 (p≤0.10). According to our discrete choice model in double-bounded dichotomous format, it was concluded that the individuals’ WTP is US$184.72 (CI: 165.52–203.92; p < 0.01). This implies a social valuation of approximately US$2232 million, corresponding to 1.09% of the GNP per capita. © 2020 The Author(s) Acceptance; Contingent valuation; COVID-19; Health economics; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccine severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 vaccine; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; unclassified drug; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; adult; aged; Article; attitude to health; Chile; chronic disease; employment status; female; health care; health care system; health survey; human; male; medical care; middle aged; perception; personal income; priority journal; quarantine; treatment planning; vaccination; Willingness To Pay; child; Coronavirus infection; economics; pandemic; public opinion; virus pneumonia; Adult; Child; Chile; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Opinion; Viral Vaccines Impact of Social Determinants of Health on the Emerging COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused a global pandemic in the months following the first four cases reported in Wuhan, China, on December 29, 2019. The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with preexisting conditions—such as asthma, cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or obesity—experience higher risk of becoming severely ill if infected with the virus. Systemic social inequality and discrepancies in socioeconomic status (SES) contribute to higher incidence of asthma, CVD, hypertension, CKD, and obesity in segments of the general population. Such preexisting conditions bring heightened risk of complications for individuals who contract the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the virus (2019-nCoV)—also known as “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). In order to help vulnerable groups during times of a health emergency, focus must be placed at the root of the problem. Studying the social determinants of health (SDOH), and how they impact disadvantaged populations during times of crisis, will help governments to better manage health emergencies so that every individual has equal opportunity to staying healthy.

As the SARS-CoV-2 virus wreaks havoc on the populations, health care infrastructures and economies of nations around the world, finding ways to protect health care workers and bolster immune responses in the general population while we await an effective vaccine will be the difference between life and death for many people. Recent studies show that innate immune populations may possess a form of memory, termed Trained Immunity (TRIM), where innate immune cells undergo metabolic, mitochondrial, and epigenetic reprogramming following exposure to an initial stimulus that results in a memory phenotype of enhanced immune responses when exposed to a secondary, heterologous, stimulus. Throughout the literature, it has been shown that the induction of TRIM using such inducers as the BCG vaccine and β-glucan can provide protection through altered immune responses against a range of viral infections. Here we hypothesize a potential role for β-glucan in decreasing worldwide morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, and posit several ideas as to how TRIM may actually shape the observed epidemiological phenomena related to COVID-19. We also evaluate the potential effects of β-glucan in relation to the immune dysregulation and cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Ultimately, we hypothesize that the use of oral β-glucan in a prophylactic setting could be an effective way to boost immune responses and abrogate symptoms in COVID-19, though clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this treatment and to further examine differential effects of β-glucan's from various sources. © Copyright © 2020 Geller and Yan.

The sport sector has been especially influenced by the COVID-19 crisis in a way that has never been seen before. This has meant an urgent need for most sport enterprises to think about new business models in order to cope with the change. The purpose of this article is to discuss in more detail how the sport sector can utilise entrepreneurship as a way of combatting uncertainty whilst promoting the recognition of new opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: A review of the existing literature on COVID-19 in terms of crisis management, entrepreneurship and sport is undertaken. This helps to understand the linkage between sport and entrepreneurship and how this can be used in times of the COVID-19 crisis. Findings: All sport businesses, athletes, managers, fans and consumers need to utilise entrepreneurial thinking in order to act creatively. This will help combat the unease and uncertainty, associated with the COVID-19 crisis and create more entrepreneurial ecosystems to develop. Originality/value: This article is the first to explicitly state the need for sport businesses to harness the entrepreneurial potential of the COVID-19 crisis thereby contributing to new practices that will help the sport sector survive this uncertain time period and flourish in the future. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The virus has rapidly spread causing a global pandemic with a major burden on the health care system and economy. The outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation on January 30, 2020. The presented guidelines describe the basic principles of outpatient care for children during the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. The guidelines were developed based on the conducted literature review, content from websites of scientific societies, and international recommendations. This paper presents guidelines concerning the outpatient care for sick children, children with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, or for children of mothers with confirmed COVID-19. Moreover, the guidelines discuss aspects associated with vaccinations, preventive visits for healthy children, and the monitoring of a child’s safety and mental health status. © 2020 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. Methods: Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. Results: We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, Inhibitory Concentration50 (IC50), MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition. Conclusion: The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2. © 2020 The Author(s).

Resource-poor countries with weaker health systems are struggling with epidemics of their own and are now in a more uncertain situation with this rapidly spreading infection. Frontline healthcare workers are succumbing to the infection in their efforts to save lives. There is an urgency to develop treatments for COVID-19, yet there is limited clinical data on the efficacy of potential drug treatments. Countries worldwide implemented a stay-at-home order to “flatten the curve” and relieve the pressure on the health system, but it is uncertain how this will unfold after the economy reopens. Trehalose, a natural glucose disaccharide, is known to impair viral function through the autophagy system. Here, we propose trehalose as a potential preventative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. © Copyright © 2020 Martinon, Borges, Gomez and Shimada. autophagy; COVID-19; prophylaxis; SARS-CoV-2; trehalose interleukin 1beta; peptides and proteins; transcription factor eb; trehalose; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; trehalose; adult respiratory distress syndrome; autophagy (cellular); clinical trial (topic); contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; cross presentation; cytokine release; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; herd immunity; human; infection control; nonhuman; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virus replication; virus transmission; adult; aged; asymptomatic disease; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; middle aged; pandemic; physiology; post exposure prophylaxis; pre-exposure prophylaxis; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Asymptomatic Diseases; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Post-Exposure Prophylaxis; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Trehalose; Virus Replication COVID-19: Emergence of Infectious Diseases, Nanotechnology Aspects, Challenges, and Future Perspectives Wuhan, a city of China, is the epicenter for the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses. The antiviral drugs and their clinical advances, along with herbal medicines for viral inhibition and immunity boosters, are described. Elaboration of tables related to CoVs for the compilation of the literature has been adopted for the better understanding. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a conceptual one based on a review of literature relating to the acquisiting and use of secondary residences or “second homes”. Findings: This paper observes that the secondary residence is often the object of a material over-investment that is symbolic and mental. The owners never quite leave their main place of residence when in the secondary one. The result is not two complementary spaces, but a hybrid space made up of the interlocking of the two. This paper also concludes that digitalization has made it easier to rent a secondary residence for a short period of time, using for instance the Airbnb platform, thus making it more an object of trade than a second home. From a sustainability perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring to the relatively rapid growth of short-term renting a halt. Further, it may encourage owners to be more psychologically and physically invested in their secondary residence, thereby contributing more to the local economy. Originality/value: Few authors have considered the way digital tools can alter the relation with the secondary place of residence. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

An outbreak of a novel coronavirus 2019 infection has posed significant threat to the health and economies in the whole world. This article reviewed the viral replication, pathogenicity, prevention and treatment strategies. With a lack of approved treatment options for this virus, alternative approaches to control the spread of disease is in urgent need. This article also covers some management strategies which may be applied to this virus outbreak. Ongoing clinical studies related to possible treatments for COVID-19, potential vaccines, and alternative medication such as natural compounds are also discussed. © Copyright © 2020 Torequl Islam, Nasiruddin, Khan, Mishra, Kudrat-E-Zahan, Alam Riaz, Ali, Rahman, Mubarak, Martorell, Cho, Calina, Docea and Sharifi-Rad. control; COVID-19 pandemic; public health; SARS-CoV-2; therapeutics  Impact of COVID-19 on China's macroeconomy and agri-food system – an economy-wide multiplier model analysis Purpose: The purpose of this study is to assess the potential economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic on China's macroeconomy and agri-food system and provide policy recommendations to stimulate economic growth and agri-food system development. Design/methodology/approach: An economy-wide multisector multiplier model built on China's most recent social accounting matrix (SAM) for 2017 with 149 economic sectors is used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on China's macroeconomy and agri-food system. SAM multiplier analysis focuses on supply chain linkages and captures the complexity of an interconnected economy. Findings: The paper finds that both the macroeconomy and agri-food systems are hit significantly by COVID-19. There are three main findings. First, affected by COVID-19, GDP decreased by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 compared with that in 2019, while the economic loss of the agri-food system is equivalent to 7% of its value added (about RMB 0.26 trillion). More than 46m agri-food system workers (about 27% of total employment) lost their jobs to COVID-19 in the lockdown phase. The COVID-19 affects the employment of unskilled labor more than that of skilled labor. Second, when the economy starts to recover during the second and third quarters, the growth rate in the value added of the agri-food system turns positive but still modest. Many jobs resume during the period, but the level of agri-food system employment continues to be lower than the base. The agri-food system employment recovery is slower than that of other sectors largely due to the sluggish recovery of restaurants. Agri-food system employment drops by 8.6m, which accounts for about 33% of the total jobs lost. Third, although the domestic economy is expected to be normal in the fourth quarter, external demand still faces uncertainties due to the global pandemic. The agri-food system is projected to grow by 1.1% annually in 2020 with resuming export demand, while only by 0.4% without resuming export demand. These rates are much lower than an annual growth rate of 4.3% for the agri-food system in 2019. The results also show that, without resuming export demand, China's total economy will grow less than 1% in 2020, while, with export demand resumed, the growth rate rises to 1.7%. These rates are much lower than an annual GDP growth rate of 6.1% in 2019. Practical implications: The results show that continuously reducing economic dependency on exports and stimulating domestic demand are key areas that require policy support. The agri-food system can play an important role in supporting broad economic growth and job creation as SMEs are major part of the AFS. Job creation requires policies to promote innovation by entrepreneurs who run numerous SMEs in China. Originality/value: This paper represents the first systematic study assessing the impact of COVID-19 on China's agri-food system in terms of value added and employment. The assessment considers three phases of lockdown, recovery and normal phases in order to capture the full potential cost of COVID-19. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Intrigued by the apparent tendency of an inverse relationship between a country’s health security capacities and Covid-19 mortalities, the paper explores the significance of a range of geographically situated contextual factors in the realms of the economy, governance and culture as mediators of the public health impacts of Covid-19, and questions how these realms may also be reshaped by this viral pandemic. The paper concludes with reflections on the path dependency and state centrality of pandemic response, and the potential post-pandemic reconfiguration of state-market-society relationships. © 2020, © 2020 Hong Kong Geographical Association. coronavirus disease; Covid-19; crisis response; health security; pandemic  COVID-19 impact on city and region: what’s next after lockdown? COVID-19 is unique in that it is spread through everyday contact with other people. Therefore, social protective measures, beyond medical protective measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, border closures, and human tracing are initiated to control the spread of COVID-19. Such responses have produced secondary issues such as drastic changes in people’s way of life and work, housing instability, economic shock, and privacy issues. This paper examines the four domains of urban and regional issues related to the secondary impact of COVID-19, including (1) social distancing, urban structure, community, and density; (2) housing affordability; (3) lockdowns, border closures, reshoring, and regional economic recovery; and (4) smart city technology, contact tracing, and privacy. The following six recommendations have been proposed. First, institutional and cultural factors are more important than urban features, such as population density. To handle infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it is important to build systems, technology, infrastructure, and urban structures that can strengthen resilience instead of implementing a directionless policy of dispersion. Second, it is necessary to improve accessibility to essential services at the community level, including medical facilities and food supply. Third, continuous effort should be made to boost housing affordability, as it is directly related to people’s basic life. Fourth, measures are needed to protect those people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. There is also the need to restore global trade and economic relations. Fifth, since data technology-based COVID-19 control raises the human tracing and privacy issue, we must ensure the principles of privacy management, such as transparency and voluntary consent, are being met. Finally, since COVID-19 is spread through people, individuals may become anxious and fearful of others without grounds; this may increase prejudice and hatred, including xenophobia. Significant social effort is needed to overcome such ill-defined anxiety and fear and maintain a healthy civil society. © 2020 The Institute of Urban Sciences. community; COVID-19; density; housing; pandemic; privacy; regional economy; smart city; urban and regional planning  Stuck in neutral? Federalism, policy instruments, and counter-cyclical responses to COVID-19 in the United States Federalism plays a foundational role in structuring public expectations about how the United States will respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, as both an unprecedented public-health crisis and an economic recession. As in prior crises, state governments are expected to be primary sites of governing authority, especially when it comes to immediate public-health needs, while it is assumed that the federal government will supply critical counter-cyclical measures to stabilize the economy and make up for major revenue shortfalls in the states. Yet there are reasons to believe that these expectations will not be fulfilled, especially when it comes to the critical juncture of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though the federal government has the capacity to engage in counter-cyclical spending to stabilize the economy, existing policy instruments vary in the extent to which they leverage that capacity. This leverage, we argue, depends on how decentralized policy arrangements affect the implementation of both discretionary emergency policies as well as automatic stabilization programs such as Unemployment Insurance, Medicaid, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Evidence on the US response to COVID-19 to date suggests the need for major revisions in the architecture of intergovernmental fiscal policy. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

To assess whether paid sick leave is available in countries around the world, we created and analysed a database of legislative guarantees of paid leave for personal illness in 193 UN member states. Original labour and social security legislation and global information on social security systems for each country were obtained and analysed by a multilingual research team using a common coding framework. While strong models exist across low- middle- and high-income countries, critical gaps that jeopardise health and economic security remain. 27% of countries do not guarantee paid sick leave from the first day of illness, essential to encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick and prevent spread. 58% of countries do not have explicit provisions to ensure self-employed and gig economy workers have access to paid sick leave benefits. Comprehensive paid sick leave policies that cover all workers are urgently needed if we are to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and be ready to respond to threats from new pathogens. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The COVID-19 pandemic broke out at a time when there were heightened uncertainties in the global economy. Understanding these uncertainties provides an important background for analyzing the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, assessing the effectiveness of policy measures in combating the pandemic and reviving the global economy, and predicting the trajectory of the economic recovery in the post-pandemic era. We analyze how COVID-19 would likely deepen an existing malaises in the global economy, and what could be done to address these problems while managing the economic recovery. We argue that three fundamental factors that could lead to a solid recovery in the post pandemic era are structural reform, new technology and re-integration. They could be managed by instituting a new “global social contract.” Supported by strong public policies at all levels, especially at national level, these three factors could bring about the salvation of the global economy as it recovers or re-emerges from the pandemic crisis. © 2020 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences COVID-19; economic recovery; global recession; global social contract  COVID-19 pandemic, oil prices, stock market, geopolitical risk and policy uncertainty nexus in the US economy: Fresh evidence from the wavelet-based approach In this paper, we analyze the connectedness between the recent spread of COVID-19, oil price volatility shock, the stock market, geopolitical risk and economic policy uncertainty in the US within a time-frequency framework. The coherence wavelet method and the wavelet-based Granger causality tests applied to US recent daily data unveil the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 and oil price shocks on the geopolitical risk levels, economic policy uncertainty and stock market volatility over the low frequency bands. The effect of the COVID-19 on the geopolitical risk substantially higher than on the US economic uncertainty. The COVID-19 risk is perceived differently over the short and the long-run and may be firstly viewed as an economic crisis. Our study offers several urgent prominent implications and endorsements for policymakers and asset managers. © 2020 Causality; COVID-19; Economic policy uncertainty; Geopolitical risk; Oil prices; Stock market; Wavelet  Hand in Glove? Processes of Formalization and the Circular Economy Post-COVID-19 The effects of COVID-19 have been severe in developing countries. It has been a particularly difficult time for informal small-scale farmers who live in rural areas and lack formal safety nets. These farmers are the cornerstone of national food security strategies. In this perspectives article, we discuss how circular economy principles could help these farmers reduce their states of vulnerability whilst engaging with nonlinear pathways of formalization. We argue that circular principles can go hand-in-glove with processes of formalization as long as interventions are made to help informal small-scale farmers overcome structural problems. We make a series of recommendations for policy makers and other stakeholders. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

Using a case study from Canada, this paper examines how the political dynamics of industry-Indigenous relations have changed and speculates about how these dynamics might continue to change in the future. The economic crisis has already intensified political conflicts and struggles between Indigenous peoples and mining, oil, and gas companies. We identify and discuss four points of conflict between Indigenous communities and extractive industries that have become more acute as a result of the current economic crisis. It is important for researchers to pay close attention to how these conflicts are affected by the pandemic, in order to help Indigenous communities develop strategies to cope with changes in industry-Indigenous relations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Canada; COVID-19; Indigenous politics  The challenges and opportunities of a global health crisis: the management and business implications of COVID-19 from an Asian perspective On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. As the evolution and implications of the COVID-19 crisis are still unfolding, we posit that exploring the experiences and strategic responses of Asian countries may shed light on ways to combat COVID-19 for the rest of the world. In this paper, we first articulate the importance of resilience, strategic agility, and entrepreneurship in the context of the fight against COVID-19. Then, with the focus on China, South Korea, and Singapore, we discuss the impact COVID-19 is having on economies and businesses, governmental support for businesses and societies, and implications for global supply chain disruptions. We hope that the global health system will recover quickly, and that the world economy will be revitalized with the contributions and collaboration of science (including social science), industry, and governments. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In developing economies and regions, the pandemic's disruption of the agriculture commodity supply chain has made it difficult for smallholder farmers to exist. Smallholder farmer's traditional struggles have worsened. However, technology may provide promise of improving conditions for vulnerable farmers even in a period of crises such as the COVID-19 period. In this article, we draw on lessons learned in developed and developing countries to propose critical digital transformation for building a resilient and sustainable post-COVID-19 supply chains for developing countries, especially for smallholder farmers operating in global value chains. We discuss how digital technologies and specifically digital inclusion of smallholder farmers can prevent major disruptions from damaging the livelihoods of society's most vulnerable. We discuss feasibility and provide some caveats for a post-COVID-19 digital inclusion in developing countries. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

Australia has not seen the huge surge of COVID-19 positive cases and subsequent hospitalisations and deaths experienced in other parts of the world. However there have been important social and health strategies to “flatten” the curve, to reduce infections and to manage those infected. These have included closure of international and interstate borders, local lockdown measures, physical distancing, shift to work from home, closure of non-essential businesses and full or partial closure of all schools and tertiary education facilities. From the diabetes care perspective, there was a significant and concerted diversion of hospital resources and staff to COVID-19 specific activities. Reduced access to primary care, diagnostic and hospital services for diabetes, combined with fear of exposure to the virus in these settings, led to a significant drop in access to usual diabetes care. Provision of outpatient and private sector diabetes services via telehealth was encouraged and supported by expanded and new government subsidies. Importantly, for the first time, there was government funded subsidy for care delivered via the telephone and inclusion of credentialled diabetes educators in funded telephone/telehealth support. The Australian health professional and consumer organisations worked cooperatively producing guidelines, position statements and other educational resources specific for the COVID-19 setting. Once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, review of all the changes will be important, determining which should be permanently implemented. The learnings from COVID-19 should help prepare Australia for future pandemics or other major health crises. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

But digitization is also helping many companies to adapt and overcome the current situation caused by COVID-19. The growth in the use of technology in the daily lives of people and companies to face this exceptional situation is an evidence of the digital acceleration process. This exploratory study analyzes the impact of digital transformation processes in three business areas: labor and social relations, marketing and sales, and technology. The impact of digitalization is expected to be transversal to each area and will encourage the emergence of new digital products and services based on the principle of flexibility. Additionally, new ways of working will foster the demand for new talent regardless of people's geographical location. Moreover, cybersecurity and privacy will become two key elements that will support the integrated development of the Internet of Things technology solutions, artificial intelligence, big data, and robotics. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

Rapid assessment and warning are crucial for an outbreak analysis in response to serious public health. SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequences with SARS-CoVs causing highly lethal pneumonia with respiratory distress and clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Notably, some COVID-19 patients also expressed neurologic signs like nausea, headache, and vomiting. Several studies have reported that coronaviruses are not only causing respiratory illness but also invade the central nervous system through a synapse-connected route. SARS-CoV infections are reported in both patients and experimental animals' brains. Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their cerebrospinal fluid. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various aspects, it remains to clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 patients. All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In the absence of potential interventions for COVID-19, there is an urgent need for an alternative strategy to control the spread of this disease. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. central nervous system; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; neuroinvasive; SARS brain function; central nervous system; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease transmission; epidemiological data; human; infection prevention; infection risk; nonhuman; public health message; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; synapse; virus detection; Betacoronavirus; biosynthesis; central nervous system; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; genetics; headache; laboratory technique; lung; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nausea; pandemic; pathogenicity; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; public health; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; vomiting; antivirus agent; virus vaccine; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Central Nervous System; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Headache; Humans; Lung; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Nausea; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Viral Vaccines; Vomiting Exploration of alternative supply chains and distributed manufacturing in response to COVID-19; a case study of medical face shields Quarantine conditions arising as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) have had a significant impact on global production-rates and supply chains. This has coincided with increased demands for medical and personal protective equipment such as face shields. Shortages have been particularly prevalent in western countries which typically rely upon global supply chains to obtain these types of device from low-cost economies. National calls for the repurposing of domestic mass-production facilities have the potential to meet medical requirements in coming weeks, however the immediate demand associated with the virus has led to the mobilisation of a diverse distributed workforce. Selection of appropriate manufacturing processes and underused supply chains is paramount to the success of these operations. A simplified medical face shield design is presented which repurposes an assortment of existing alternative supply chains. The device is easy to produce with minimal equipment and training. It is hoped that the methodology and approach presented is of use to the wider community at this critical time. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Distributed manufacturing; Medical face shields; Micro-supply chains; Repurposed manufacture; Simplified design Manufacture; Protective clothing; Viruses; Distributed manufacturing; Exploration of alternatives; Global production; Global supply chain; Low-cost economy; Manufacturing process; Personal protective equipment; Western countries; Supply chains COVID-19, an opportunity to reevaluate the correlation between long-term effects of anthropogenic pollutants on viral epidemic/pandemic events and prevalence Occupational, residential, dietary and environmental exposures to mixtures of synthetic anthropogenic chemicals after World War II have a strong relationship with the increase of chronic diseases, health cost and environmental pollution. The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)–B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Chronic diseases; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Immune deficiency; Pandemic; Pollutants; SARS-CoV-2; Xenobiotics angiotensin converting enzyme 2; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; fossil fuel; heavy metal; multi walled nanotube; pesticide; xenobiotic agent; antivirus agent; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; airborne particle; Article; biochemistry; biophysics; cell function; cell level; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; dietary supplement; economic aspect; human; immune deficiency; immune system; immunopathology; immunotoxicity; intestine flora; ionizing radiation; lifestyle; long term exposure; macrophage; pandemic; particulate matter; pollutant; prevalence; protein expression; public health; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; ultraviolet B radiation; virus immunity; vulnerable population; air pollutant; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diet; drug effect; epidemic; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; time; toxicity; virus pneumonia; Air Pollutants; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diet; Epidemics; Humans; Immune System; Pandemics; Pesticides; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Time; Xenobiotics COVID-19 healthcare planning: Predicting mortality and the role of the herd immunity barrier in the general population Using a mathematical model for COVID-19 incorporating data on excess of mortality compared to the corresponding period of the previous year obtained from the daily monitoring of mortality in Spain (MoMo), the prediction of total number of casualties in Spain for the first outbreak has been computed. From this figure, and following a stepwise meta-analysis of available reports, the case fatality rate (CFR) and the infectious case fatality rate (IFR) for the outbreak have been estimated. As the impact of age on these rates is notable, it is proposed to include an age-related adjusted fatality ratio in future comparative analyses between studies, calculated by adjusting the results by risk ratio to a reference age band (e.g., 60-69). From the casualty figures, and the corresponding CFR and IFR ratios, the forecast of serologically positive cases in the general Spanish population has been estimated at approximately 1% (0.87-1.3%) of the samples. If the data are confirmed by the ongoing study of the Carlos III Institute, until a vaccine is found, the immunity acquired in the general population after the infectious outbreak is far from the 65-70% herd immunity required as a barrier for COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper offers a critical and context-based approach to understanding globalization and localization by challenging the conceptualization of ‘value’ and ‘risk’ within the current global production networks framework as well as identifying key operational strategies in risk management and national security. An analysis of the adaptation strategies of the GPNs of 91 companies identifies the role played by four different forms of value in configuring production networks. This is to balance ‘economic value’ with non-price-based sources of value and alternative values. The analysis underscores the critical role of the state in ensuring national and human security as well as its increasing power as a key actor in GPNs and the global economy. © 2020 Royal Dutch Geographical Society / Koninklijk Nederlands Aardrijkskundig China-United States trade war; COVID-19; evolutionary economic geography; global production networks; risk; value  COVID-19 and fiscal space for health system in Pakistan: It is time for a policy decision Most developing countries with weak economies and low GDPs strive to invest an optimal amount of budget to health sector. Compounding on this state of affairs is their inherent inefficiency to spend even that meager amount on the welfare of the patients, improving service delivery, motivating their workforce and making their health systems responsive to the needs of the people they serve. With weak fiscal base and inelasticity in budget spending, when these countries face a catastrophe like COVID-19, there is a whole situation of havoc and lack of finances emerges as the biggest issue in such crises. Pakistan has been no exception to this kind of situation. Government funds allocated to other public sector development schemes are diverted to deal with the health emergency. Hence, the result is an overall socioeconomic shock that a country has to face. Amid such crises, other international commitments also face a state of uncertainty. With the changing disease patterns all over the world, the public financial management system for health sector needs to be revisited to devise a more sustainable and resilient mechanism not only to absorb shocks like COVID-19 but also to meet the international health commitments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, most COVID-19 patients receive traditional supportive care including breathing assistance. To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Second, since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development that aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation. © 2020 The Authors.

As governments consider public health and economic strategies to respond to the crisis, it is critical they also address the weaknesses of their economic and social systems that inhibited their ability to respond comprehensively to the pandemic. These same weaknesses have also undermined efforts to advance equality and sustainability. This paper explores over 30 interventions across the following nine categories of change that hold the potential to address inequality, provide all citizens with access to essential goods and services, and advance progress towards sustainability: (1) Income and wealth transfers to facilitate an equitable increase in purchasing power/disposable income; (2) broadening worker and citizen ownership of the means of production and supply of services, allowing corporate profit-taking to be more equitably distributed; (3) changes in the supply of essential goods and services for more citizens; (4) changes in the demand for more sustainable goods and services desired by people; (5) stabilizing and securing employment and the workforce; (6) reducing the disproportionate power of corporations and the very wealthy on the market and political system through the expansion and enforcement of antitrust law such that the dominance of a few firms in critical sectors no longer prevails; (7) government provision of essential goods and services such as education, healthcare, housing, food, and mobility; (8) a reallocation of government spending between military operations and domestic social needs; and (9) suspending or restructuring debt from emerging and developing countries. Any interventions that focus on growing the economy must also be accompanied by those that offset the resulting compromises to health, safety, and the environment from increasing unsustainable consumption. This paper compares and identifies the interventions that should be considered as an important foundational first step in moving beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and towards sustainability. In this regard, it provides a comprehensive set of strategies that could advance progress towards a component of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 10 to reduce inequality within countries. However, the candidate interventions are also contrasted with all 17 SDGs to reveal potential problem areas/tradeoffs that may need careful attention. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus, it is important to understand how global factors linked with the functioning of the Anthropocene are responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak. We tested hypotheses that the number of COVID-19 cases, number of deaths and growth rate of recorded infections: (1) are positively associated with population density as well as (2) proportion of the human population living in urban areas as a proxies of interpersonal contact rate, (3) age of the population in a given country as an indication of that population's susceptibility to COVID-19; (4) net migration rate and (5) number of tourists as proxies of infection pressure, and negatively associated with (5) gross domestic product which is a proxy of health care quality. Data at the country level were compiled from publicly available databases and analysed with gradient boosting regression trees after controlling for confounding factors (e.g. geographic location). We found a positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases in a given country and gross domestic product, number of tourists, and geographic longitude. The number of deaths was positively associated with gross domestic product, number of tourists in a country, and geographic longitude. The effects of gross domestic product and number of tourists were non-linear, with clear thresholds above which the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased rapidly. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was positively linked to the number of tourists and gross domestic product. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was negatively associated with the mean age of the population and geographic longitude. Growth was slower in less urbanised countries. This study demonstrates that the characteristics of the human population and high mobility, but not population density, may help explain the global spread of the virus. In addition, geography, possibly via climate, may play a role in the pandemic. The unexpected positive and strong association between gross domestic product and number of cases, deaths, and growth rate suggests that COVID-19 may be a new civilisation disease affecting rich economies. © 2020 Skórka et al.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an unprecedented global crisis that has not been experienced, which is still disrupting health systems, economies, and societies around the world by the rapid spread. Bronchoscopy plays an important role in diagnosis and therapy of pulmonary diseases, especially in patients with severe pulmonary infection, however, application of bronchoscopy in patients suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely limited for the potential airborne transmission from aerosol generated during the procedure. This consensus statement was completed by expert panel of Interventional & Minimally Invasive Respiratory Committee of China Medical Education Association, and the issues were summarized as seven key topics to define the indications of bronchoscopy and matters needing attentions on the bronchoscopy procedures in patients with COVID-19, as well as the protective precaution strategies to avoid nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection. © 2020 Spring Media.

While lockdowns may be an important tool to limit transmission, they come at a potentially great cost with regard to economic impact, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from non–COVID-19 diseases. Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries. Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to “unlock” or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. “Precision physical distancing”—distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings—is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19. It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures. Precision physical distancing can be one important component of a sustainable long-term solution that is proportionate to the risk yet does not have a disproportionate impact on society and the economy, allowing a partial return to normal activities, with the community as an essential partner.

Further, factors responsible for outbreak mismanagement with strategies for effective preparedness is focused. It also highlights the age-old colonial law, so-called the backbone of Indian healthcare policy in strategizing healthcare emergencies. The gaps in the present policy indicate an immediate requirement for an overarching law that governs public health care. The review also envisages the safety and security measures taken by the Indian government against COVID-19, prioritising health over the economy. Finally, flagship changes required in national healthcare policy to prepare the country to fight against any upcoming pandemic outbreaks are suggested. © 2020, Radiance Research Academy.

The fear resulting from the disease, the ‘lockdown’ situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns. The present consensus guidance discusses these risks and makes some practical recommendations that may help diminish them. © 2020  anxiety; Article; behavior assessment; consensus; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; fear; gambling; game addiction; human; information technology; internet addiction; pornography; reinforcement; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stress; substance use; treatment planning; anxiety disorder; Betacoronavirus; consensus; coping behavior; Coronavirus infection; Internet; pandemic; psychology; video game; virus pneumonia; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Humans; Internet; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Video Games Three months of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis The pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2019), reminiscent of the 2002-SARS-CoV outbreak, has completely isolated countries, disrupted health systems and partially paralyzed international trade and travel. In order to be better equipped to anticipate transmission of this virus to new regions, it is imperative to track the progress of the virus over time. This review analyses information on progression of the pandemic in the past 3 months and systematically discusses the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2019 virus including its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, the review also encompasses some recently proposed conceptual models that estimate the spread of this disease based on the basic reproductive number for better prevention and control procedures. Finally, we shed light on how the virus has endangered the global economy, impacting it both from the supply and demand side. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd ACE-2; COVID-19; mathematical modeling; pandemic; SARS-CoV alpha interferon; arbidol; chloroquine; favipiravir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; antivirus agent; antibody detection; antigen detection; basic reproduction number; clinical feature; computer model; conceptual model; coronavirus disease 2019; genome analysis; human; meta analysis; pandemic; pathophysiology; physical disease by body function; prevention and control; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus classification; virus morphology; virus transmission; adaptive immunity; Betacoronavirus; classification; commercial phenomena; Coronavirus infection; economics; genetics; laboratory technique; pandemic; pathogenicity; physiology; theoretical model; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; virus replication; Adaptive Immunity; Antiviral Agents; Basic Reproduction Number; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Commerce; Coronavirus Infections; Economics; Genome, Viral; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Replication COVID-19 Outbreak: An Overview Background: In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Summary: A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures. © 2020 S.

The current pandemic caused by this coronavirus has already negatively affected millions of people and the economies of countries worldwide. However, the challenges faced by Saudi Arabia during the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic that began in 2012 led to marked improvements in the government's response to the current pandemic. Saudi Arabia is one of largest countries in the Middle East and is home to the holiest Muslim sites. Since the global risk of the virus was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), Saudi Arabia has taken substantial public health measures to control the spread of the infection. This review reports on the transmission of SARS-COV-2 in Saudi Arabia and the proactive responses taken by the government, comparing the Saudi government's actions and their effects with those of other countries. Although Saudi Arabia is currently experiencing the peak of the pandemic, their early precautionary responses have shortened the period of individual/family isolation, reduced the number of confirmed infections and infection-related fatality rates, and decreased the economic burden of the people and the country compared with other countries in the Middle East and elsewhere. © 2020 Obeid et al.

Although it primarily affects the lungs, it shares a strong interplay with the cardiovascular system. The presence of underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) predispose the patients to increased severity and mortality associated with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 itself leads to various cardiovascular complications, which increase its associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients. It is, therefore, prudent to review the rapidly evolving data in this field and understand the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular involvement of this lethal disease. © 2020 Cardiovascular disease; Comorbidities; Complications; Coronavirus; COVID-19 angiotensin converting enzyme 2; natriuretic factor; troponin; acute coronary syndrome; acute heart failure; cardiogenic shock; cardiovascular disease; childhood mortality; comorbidity; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease association; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart injury; human; immune response; morbidity; myocarditis; primary prevention; prognosis; Review; risk factor; thromboembolism; treatment indication; venous thromboembolism Crisis Decision-Making on a Global Scale: Transition from Cognition to Collective Action under Threat of COVID-19 This essay examines basic functions of crisis decision-making—cognition, communication, coordination, and control—in response to COVID-19. This crisis decision-making framework is applied to cases from South Korea, Italy, and the United States as public officials grapple with how to recognize, respond, and recover from this deadly, invisible threat. The authors acknowledge the harsh trade-off between the compelling need to limit transmission of the virus to protect public health and the consequent economic losses of halting social interaction. They draw implications from this crisis for better decision-making and investment in a global information infrastructure system to manage large-scale, multidisciplinary threats to the health, economy, and sustainability of the world's community of nations. The essay concludes that collective cognition, amplified by timely, valid communication and supported by sound planning, trained personnel, appropriate technology, and bold leadership, enables coordinated action needed to bring a large-scale global crisis under control. Evidence for Practice: Invest in information technology to manage systematic data collection, analysis, and modeling. Provide timely, informed updates on community status to constituents. Maintain a knowledge base of resources, vulnerabilities, and plans. © 2020 by The American Society for Public Administration   A comprehensive review on drug repositioning against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the reason for this ongoing pandemic infection diseases termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has emerged since early December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. In this century, it is the worst threat to international health and the economy. After 4 months of COVID-19 outbreak, there is no certain and approved medicine against it. In this public health emergency, it makes sense to investigate the possible effects of old drugs and find drug repositioning that is efficient, economical, and riskless process. Old drugs that may be effective are from different pharmacological categories, antimalarials, anthelmintics, anti-protozoal, anti-HIVs, anti-influenza, anti-hepacivirus, antineoplastics, neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulins, and interferons. In vitro, in vivo, or preliminary trials of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging, leading to new research projects and trials to find the best drug/s. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of these drugs against COVID-19. Also, it should be mentioned that in this manuscript, we discuss preliminary rationales; however, clinical trial evidence is needed to prove them. COVID-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations. Moreover, herein, we describe current evidence that may be changed in the future. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

It shows that the main directions on this path are financial boosting of investment in fixed assets and, to a greater extent, human capital. The state should put emphasis on technological re-equipping of the entire national economy, modern infrastructure, accelerated housing and social construction, and poverty alleviation. Mobilization of investment in fixed assets and knowledge economy is considered the main driver of socioeconomic development in regions and overcoming the present economic and social inequality. The potential advantages of investment lending, issuance of regional loans, and local budgets optimization are analyzed in detail. The article considers the opportunities regions have in improving the well-being of the population. Among the proposed measures are raising of the minimum wage, insurance in shared financing of housing construction, an adequate system of social benefits based on monitoring of needy families, and expansion of loans issued for education. The set of measures proposed by the author is supplemented by a set of necessary corrective measures in the face of serious risks involved in continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and oil crisis. The article stresses a particular role of financial and monetary authorities in supporting business and the public. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

However, in Africa, much of the emphasis on BE is placed on economic gains; as a result, traditional livelihoods and small-scale local operations are outcompeted by international corporations and government initiatives, with little or no regard for social inclusion and environmental sustainability. We argue that successful BE initiatives in Africa accentuate the involvement of local communities and promote sustenance of the natural ecosystem. We define success in terms of the sustainability balance among ecological, social and economic aspects. Drawing on extensive expert experiences, observational data and literature review of case studies across the African continent, we highlight two critical findings. First, large scale BE initiatives prioritize economic gains at the expense of environmental degradation and the exclusion of local communities. Second, using the full spectrum sustainability (FSS) evaluation, we show that successful BE interventions considered ecological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional objectives. Drawing on these case studies, we propose the adoption of a collaborative framework which amalgamates the top-down and bottom-up approaches to BE management. Achieving the goal of successful blue growth in Africa is now even more challenged by the implications of COVID-19 on the BE sectors. Reimagining and rebuilding a resilient BE in Africa post-coronavirus will require a strong political commitment to promoting a balance between economic, social and environmental benefits in line with the African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. © 2020 Okafor-Yarwood, Kadagi, Miranda, Uku, Elegbede and Adewumi.

There are few reports on factors influencing the transmission of 2019-nCoV, such as environmental conditions (humidity and temperature), air pollution, and human activities. It is difficult to sample and research 2019-nCoV directly. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the factors influencing the spread and survival of other similar viruses, which is instructional for the prevention of epidemics and the control of 2019-nCoV transmission. The results show that: (1) Low temperature and low humidity could prolong the lifetime and increase the transmission of coronavirus, especially on dry surfaces. For example, coronavirus can survive on a smooth surface at a temperature of 22-25 ℃ and a relative humidity (RH) of 40%-45% for more than 5 days. (2) Similarly, the survival rates of the aerosolized coronavirus is also high in a closed environment at low temperature and low humidity, 2019-nCoV may hold high survival rates at a temperature of 20-25 ℃ and a relative humidity of 30%-50%. (3) The higher the particle concentration, the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission may increase. (4) The behavior of infected people also plays a important role in the transmission of 2019-nCoV. The transmission of virus can be reduced by avoiding sneezing and coughing in the crowd, and blocking the transmission of droplets using hands, elbows or other objects. Considering the above analysis, some suggestions for the prevention and control the epidemics are made, such as improving the indoor microenvironment, investigating the detection, inactivation, influence factors and propagation characteristics of 2019-nCoV. © 2020, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

Initially, impressed with critiques of the sudden ‘demonetisation’ on 8 November 2016, we conducted econometric research to test how banks (‘bricks’) could be brought closer to rural people. However, this traditional approach of envisaging more banks was rapidly overtaken by the massive uptake of digital payment methods (‘clicks’) in India since 2016. Partly driven by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), this has raised new concerns and research agenda focused on people’s trust in banking and new technologies, consumer skills and people’s basic rights vis-à-vis a state that, controversially, now seems to be seeking more control within a relentlessly changing postmodern scenario. © 2020 SAGE Publications. banking; cashless economy; COVID-19; demonetisation; development; digitalisation; India; pandemic; trust  Somewhere over the rainbow - Third sector research in and beyond coronavirus The coronavirus pandemic has rapidly become a multifaceted global crisis, disrupting economies, livelihoods and ways of life, with significant ramifications for the third sector. This paper seeks to prompt a conversation about third sector research agendas, which might be animated in and beyond coronavirus, focusing primarily on the experience of the sector in the UK but including references globally. After a brief discussion of the acute three-dimensional crisis facing the sector, the paper raises questions for now and later at three interconnected levels: of practice, organisation and society. The paper concludes with a call for critically engaged curiosity about the role and fortunes of the third sector in a time of lockdown and its aftermath. © Policy Press 2020 Charity; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Third sector  A multiscale model of virus pandemic: Heterogeneous interactive entities in a globally connected world This paper is devoted to the multidisciplinary modelling of a pandemic initiated by an aggressive virus, specifically the so-called SARS-CoV-2 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, corona virus n.2. The study is developed within a multiscale framework accounting for the interaction of different spatial scales, from the small scale of the virus itself and cells, to the large scale of individuals and further up to the collective behaviour of populations. An interdisciplinary vision is developed thanks to the contributions of epidemiologists, immunologists and economists as well as those of mathematical modellers. The first part of the contents is devoted to understanding the complex features of the system and to the design of a modelling rationale. The modelling approach is treated in the second part of the paper by showing both how the virus propagates into infected individuals, successfully and not successfully recovered, and also the spatial patterns, which are subsequently studied by kinetic and lattice models. The third part reports the contribution of research in the fields of virology, epidemiology, immune competition, and economy focussed also on social behaviours. Finally, a critical analysis is proposed looking ahead to research perspectives. © 2020 The Author(s). complexity; COVID-19; immune competition; intracellular infection dynamics; living systems; multiscale problems; networks; SARS-CoV-2; spatial patterns; viral quasispecies; virus structure modelling Economics; Viruses; Collective behaviour; Critical analysis; Lattice models; Multi-scale frameworks; Multi-scale Modeling; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Social behaviour; Spatial patterns; Diseases Neuropathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged as a serious jolt to human life and economy. Initial knowledge established pulmonary complications as the chief symptom, however, the neurological aspect of the disease is also becoming increasingly evident. Emerging reports of encephalopathies and similar ailments with the detection of the virus in the CSF has elicited an urgent need for investigating the possibility of neuroinvasiveness of the virus, which cannot be ruled out given the expression of low levels of ACE2 receptors in the brain. Sensory impairments of the olfactory and gustatory systems have also been reported in a large proportion of the cases, indicating the involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Hence, the possibility of neurological damage caused by the virus demands immediate attention and investigation of the mechanisms involved, so as to customize the treatment of patients presenting with neurological complications. © Khan and Gomes.  angiotensin converting enzyme 2; C reactive protein; D dimer; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; virus receptor; ageusia; altered state of consciousness; anosmia; Article; brain disease; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; carboxy terminal sequence; central nervous system; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; coronavirus disease 2019; encephalitis; gene expression; Guillain Barre syndrome; human; meningitis; myalgia; neuropathology; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pandemic; paresis; peripheral nervous system; protein expression; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; seizure; sensory dysfunction; sepsis-associated coagulopathy; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; smelling disorder; taste disorder; throat culture; unconsciousness; virus transmission; ageusia; Betacoronavirus; biological model; brain; cerebrovascular disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; metabolism; neurologic disease; pathogenicity; pathophysiology; physiology; smelling disorder; virology; virus encephalitis; virus pneumonia; Ageusia; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Cerebrovascular Disorders; Coronavirus Infections; Encephalitis, Viral; Host Microbial Interactions; Humans; Models, Neurological; Nervous System Diseases; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Virus A review of micro-based systemic risk research from multiple perspectives The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about a heavy impact on the world economy, which arouses growing concerns about potential systemic risk, taking place in countries and regions. At this critical moment, it makes sense to interpret the systemic risk from the perspective of the financial crisis framework. By combing the latest research on systemic risks, we may arrive at some precautions relating to the current events. This literature review verifies the origin of systemic risk research. By comparing the retrieved and screened systemic literature with the relevant research on the financial crisis, more focus on the micro-foundations of systemic risk has been discovered. Besides, the measurement methods of systemic risks and the introduction of interdisciplinary methods have made the research in this field particularly active. This paper synthesizes the previous research conclusions to find the appropriate definition of systemic risk and combs the research literature of systemic risk from two lines: Firstly, conducting the division according to the sub-branch fields within the financial discipline and the relevant interdisciplinary research methods, which is helpful for scholars within and outside the discipline to have a more systematic understanding of the research in this field. Secondly predicting the research direction that can be expanded in this field. © 2020 by the authors.

The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused more than 3.7 million infected people and 260000 deaths over 210 countries around the world from December 2019 to May 7, 2020, which has seriously affected the safety of people, the stability of social order, and the development of the economy. Therefore, it is urgent to explore and implement new prevention and control programs for such major pandemics. With the development of robots and artificial intelligence technologies, various intelligent robots for emergency prevention and control in complex conditions have emerged, and they have played paramount roles in disease prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing. Based on the problems of insufficient supply of materials and heavy disinfection tasks during the prevention and control of major outbreaks, we study the systematic procedures and applications of medical material handling robots, multi-scene disinfection robots, medical assistant robots, prevention and control robots, and production resumption robots. Moreover, we comparatively analyze the current situation of key technologies of pandemic emergency prevention and control robots, such as environmental perception, autonomous navigation, motion planning, and 5G communication technology. In conclusion, we put forward a technical prospect of intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics. © 2020, Science Press.

The epidemic lifetime should be accurate so that timely and remedial steps are determined. These include the closing of borders schools, suspension of community and commuting services. The forecast of an outbreak effectively is a very necessary but difficult task. A predictive model that provides the best possible forecast is a great challenge for machine learning with only a few samples of training available. This work proposes and examines a prediction model based on a deep extreme learning machine (DELM). This methodology is used to carry out an experiment based on the recent Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. An optimized prediction model that has been developed, namely DELM, is demonstrated to be able to make a prediction that is fairly best. The results show that the new methodology is useful in developing an appropriate forecast when the samples are far from abundant during the critical period of the disease. During the investigation, it is shown that the proposed approach has the highest accuracy rate of 97.59% with 70% of training, 30% of test and validation. Simulation results validate the prediction effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2020 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

In the initial period of the pandemic, it was uncertain whether SARS-CoV-2 could be spread through food. All major European and world food safety and epidemiological organizations (EFSA, WHO, CDC, FDA, etc.) claim that SARS-CoV-2 does not spread through food. However, we know that the virus is stable in aerosols and on certain surfaces for a few hours to days (up to 3 days). At the same time, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on food, nutrition, health, the environment, and the entire food network are very diverse, which the author briefly reviews. © 2020, Wessling International Research and Educational Centre Nonprofit Beneficial Ltd..

Globalisation is under significant threat as governments scramble to reduce their vulnerability to the virus by limiting global trade and flows of people. With the imposition of border closures and strict migration measures, there have been major disruptions in Africa's global supply chains with adverse impacts on employment and poverty. The African economies overly reliant on single export-orientated industries, such as oil and gas, are expected to be severely hit. This situation is further aggravated by tumbling oil prices and a lowered global demand for African non-oil products. The agricultural sector, which should buffer these shocks, is also being affected by the enforcement of lockdowns which threaten people's livelihoods and food security. Lockdowns may not be the answer in Africa and the issue of public health pandemic response will need to be addressed by enacting context-specific policies which should be implemented in a humane way. In addressing the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on African nations, we argue that governments should prioritize social protection programmes to provide people with resources to maintain economic productivity while limiting job losses. International funders are committing assistance to Africa for this purpose, but generally as loans (adding to debt burdens) rather than as grants. G20 agreement so suspend debt payments for a year will help, but is insufficient to fiscal need. Maintaining cross-border trade and cooperation to continue generating public revenues is desirable. New strategies for diversifying African economies and limiting their dependence on external funding by promoting trade with a more regionalised (continental) focus as promoted by the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, while not without limitations, should be explored. While it is premature to judge the final economic and death toll of COVID-19, African leaders' response to the pandemic, and the support they receive from wealthier nations, will determine its eventual outcomes. © 2020 The Author(s).

This study aims to analyse the health of the Italian Alpine economy through the performance of its capital companies, defined as those operating in the strictly mountainous are-as within the territories covered by the Alpine Convention. The authors compare the performance (2012-2018) of the “inner core” firms with a counterfactual sample of companies from neighbouring territories to delineate the strengths and weaknesses of the Alpine enterprises. The paper addresses policymakers and practitioners who will design the future policies for the high lands, exploiting a vast collaborative planning network. Design/methodology/approach: The study analyses two broad strands of literature on territorial competitiveness. It uses the coarsened exact matching techniques for the selection of a counterfactual sample at the enterprise level. The study follows a policy-oriented design, offering answers to future challenges. Findings: The Alpine region has several different local production systems, with a significant level of heterogeneity among firms that differentiate the top 25% from the rest. The counterfactual analysis carried out does not provide clear evidence of significant differences. Instead, it con-firms strong similarities between the Alpine core and the peri-Alpine belt. It is only in terms of employment growth that the core grows less (with a high statistical significance). Finally, the authors introduce the analysis of sustainable value added (SVA) in the core area and use the “tourism chain” to compare different models. The focus here is on two keywords – rarefied and uncontaminated – that enable the transformation of some typical weaknesses of the “minor (or marginal) mountain” into assets for development, provided that place-based and network policies are activated. Research limitations/implications: The study focusses on the Italian Alps and could be extended in the future to the other countries participating in the Alpine Convention. It may also be enriched by qualitative analyses of partnerships and sole proprietorships that are not identified by the balance sheet analysis. Practical implications: The study follows a policy-oriented design, offering possible solutions to future challenges. Social implications: The study offers some suggestions on the post-COVID-19 phase. The bottom-up, reluctant and community dimension are possible strengths to face the challenges that are opening up. Originality/value: The study is one of the very few to carry out a counterfactual analysis of Alpine enterprises. It offers evidence on the strengths and weaknesses of the productive fabric of the high lands and updates the assessment of the health status of Alpine enterprises to accompany future fact-based policies after the COVID pandemic. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

However, this may not be feasible in complex situations like the current global pandemic. We argue that in such environments where Knightian uncertainty plays a big role, the behaviour of countries, sectors of the economy, and individuals may be characterised by procedural rationality. Instead of focusing on the outcome, it is argued that the decision-maker draws upon similar experiences and follows a consistent procedure. © 2020 Economic and Political Weekly.

A Snapshot of the Global Race for Vaccines Targeting SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 Pandemic A novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered the human population and has spread rapidly around the world in the first half of 2020 causing a global pandemic. The virus uses its spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain to interact with host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) sites to initiate a cascade of events that culminate in severe acute respiratory syndrome in some individuals. In efforts to curtail viral spread, authorities initiated far-reaching lockdowns that have disrupted global economies. The scientific and medical communities are mounting serious efforts to limit this pandemic and subsequent waves of viral spread by developing preventative vaccines and repurposing existing drugs as potential therapies. In this review, we focus on the latest developments in COVID-19 vaccine development, including results of the first Phase I clinical trials and describe a number of the early candidates that are emerging in the field. We seek to provide a balanced coverage of the seven main platforms used in vaccine development that will lead to a desired target product profile for the “ideal” vaccine. Using tales of past vaccine discovery efforts that have taken many years or that have failed, we temper over exuberant enthusiasm with cautious optimism that the global medical community will reach the elusive target to treat COVID-19 and end the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Funk, Laferrière and Ardakani. clinical trial; coronavirus; COVID-19; immune response; public health; SARS-CoV-2; vaccine advac; azd 1222; bnt 162; coronavac; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; COVID 19 vaccine; DNA vaccine; inactivated virus vaccine; ino 4800; live vaccine; messenger RNA 1273; nvxcov 237; nvxcov 2373; per.c6; placebo; recombinant protein; RNA vaccine; scb 2019; unclassified drug; coronavirus disease 2019; drug design; drug research; drug targeting; human; Human adenovirus 5; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptomatology; treatment indication; vaccination; virus genome; virus transmission Economic implication of a novel disease outbreak understanding its genesis Novel disease outbreaks have a history of ravaging the regional economies.

Chemistry and Biology of SARS-CoV-2 Challenges and opportunities: • The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has changed our world in just half a year: a large number of people have died from the virus-induced pneumonia COVID-19, and the global economy is at an unprecedented low with unknown near- and long-term consequences. • The coronavirus pandemic needs a two-pronged approach: a short-term solution to find a drug to treat the massive number of seriously ill patients, and long-term development of preventive and curative drugs for future corona outbreaks. • De novo drug discovery takes years to move from idea and/or pre-clinic to market release and is not a short-term solution for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Drug repurposing is perhaps the only short-term solution, and vaccination is a middle-term solution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV or Wuhan coronavirus) caused an unprecedented fast-spreading worldwide pandemic. Although currently with a rather low mortality rate, the virus spread rapidly over the world using the modern world's traffic highways. The coronavirus (CoV) family members were responsible for several deadly outbreaks and epidemics during the last decade. Not only governments but also the scientific community reacted promptly to the outbreak, and information is shared quickly. For example, the genetic fingerprint was shared, and the 3D structure of key proteins was rapidly solved, which can be used for the discovery of potential treatments. An overview is given on the current knowledge of the spread, disease course, and molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. We discuss potential treatment developments in the context of recent outbreaks, drug repurposing, and development timelines. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.This perspective covers the chemistry and biology of SARS-CoV-2 and potential pharmacological interventions of the coronavirus pandemic, including discussion of the different drug modalities such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]).

Baseline Findings From the PsyCovid Study The Covid-19 pandemic is burning all over the world. National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding the psychosocial and economic effects is growing quickly. The PsyCovid Study assessed the influence of psychosocial variables on individual differences from the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the issues of health and economy in the Italian population. Italian volunteers from different regions completed an online anonymous survey. The main outcomes were the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health and the economy. A two-way MANOVA evaluated differences in the main outcomes, with geographical area (northern, central, and southern regions) and professional status (healthcare workers or not) as factors. We then tested the relationship linking psychosocial variables (i.e. perceived distress and social isolation, empathy, and coping style) to the main outcomes through two different mediation models. 1163 responders completed the survey (835 females; mean age: 42 ± 13.5 y.o.; age range: 18-81 y.o.) between March 14 and 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and people living in northern Italy reported a significantly worse outbreak impact on health, but not on the economy. In the whole sample, distress and loneliness were key variables influencing the perceived impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on health, while empathy and coping style affected the perceived impact on the economy. The Covid-19 pandemic is a worldwide emergency in terms of psychological, social, and economic consequences. Our data suggests that in the Italian population, actual differences in individual perception of the Covid-19 outbreak severity for health are dramatically modulated by psychosocial frailty (i.e., distress and loneliness). At the same time, problem-oriented coping strategies and enhanced empathic abilities increase people's awareness of the severity of the impact of the Covid-19 emergency on economics. There is an immediate need for consensus guidelines and healthcare policies to support interventions aimed to manage psychosocial distress and increase population resilience towards the imminent crisis. © Copyright © 2020 Cerami, Santi, Galandra, Dodich, Cappa, Vecchi and Crespi. coping abilities; Covid-19 outbreak; distress; economic crisis; empathy; loneliness; perceived impact on health; psychosocial frailty adult; aged; Article; awareness; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; distress syndrome; economic aspect; economic crisis; empathy; epidemic; female; human; Italian (citizen); Italy; loneliness; major clinical study; male; perception; psychosocial care; risk factor; social isolation; young adult ECMO use in COVID-19: Lessons from past respiratory virus outbreaks - A narrative review The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to grow exponentially in most countries, posing an unprecedented burden on the healthcare sector and the world economy. Previous respiratory virus outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic H1N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), have provided significant insights into preparation and provision of intensive care support including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Many patients have already been supported with ECMO during the current COVID-19 pandemic, and it is likely that many more may receive ECMO support, although, at this point, the role of ECMO in COVID-19-related cardiopulmonary failure is unclear. Here, we review the experience with the use of ECMO in the past respiratory virus outbreaks and discuss potential role for ECMO in COVID-19. © 2020 The Author(s).

A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including patient quarantine and mass “social distancing” measures. Although the clinical manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide.

Based on Granger test, questionnaire survey, enterprise research and expert interview, the overall impacts of shipping and port industry were evaluated. Focusing on different market segments, the different impacts on ports, containers, tankers, dry bulk cargoes, cruise ships and other subdivisions were evaluated. Combined with the current difficulties of the shipping and port industry, major countermeasures were put forward. Research result shows that the COVID-19 epidemic has taken a severe recession on global economy, trade and industry, and has been transmitted to the shipping industry by global supply chains. There is a strong Granger causal relationship between the COVID-19 daily new cases and the Baltic Dry Index. In the first quarter of 2020, the throughput of cargo and containers of main monitored ports in China were 105 353×104 t and 3 766.6×104 TEU, respectively, and year-on-year decrease by 3.5% and 8.6%, respectively. The epidemic has a greater short-term impact on dry bulk cargo, containers and oil tankers. In February 2020, the throughput of the eight major container hub ports declined by 19.8% year-on-year, and cruise passenger transport was hit by the overall closure. The recovery will be a slow process, and the COVID-19 epidemic will continue to have a negative impact on the shipping and port industry. It is suggested that some measures are put forward such as strengthening overseas port policy and port linking tracking, avoiding ship charter disputes and legal risks, improving the system of prevention and control of cruise ships, and promoting the development of smart ports and smart shipping. 3 tabs, 8 figs, 32 refs. © 2020, Editorial Department of Journal of Traffic and Transportation Engineering.

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World. Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings. Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality. Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks. The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics. Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered. The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only. COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert. COVID-19 is the first coronavirus after Spanish Flu 1918–1919, who has extremely influenced the health system, economy, and psychology of India. The present study review is on the general continent, virology, pathogenesis, global epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and control of COVID-19 with the reference to India. © 2020, Indian Virological Society.

People with chronic health conditions may be at greater risk of contracting or experiencing complications from COVID-19. In addition to illness or death for those who contract the virus, the physical distancing required to flatten the curve of new cases is having a negative impact on the economy, the effects of which intersect with mental health and other existing health concerns, thus affecting marginalized communities. Given that HIV also has a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, COVID-19 is affecting people with HIV (PWH) in unique ways and will continue to have an impact on HIV research and treatment after the COVID-19 crisis passes. Using the biopsychosocial framework to contextualize the impact of COVID-19 on PWH, the purpose of this review article is to: (1) outline the similarities and differences between the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics; (2) describe the current and future impact of COVID-19 on PWH; and (3) outline a call to action for scientists and practitioners to respond to the impact of COVID-19 on HIV prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

Most of the affected countries took several measures, like lockdowns, business shutdowns, hygiene regulations, social distancing, school and university closings, or mobility tracking as a means of slowing down the distribution of COVID-19. These measures are expected to show short-term and long-term effects on people's working lives. However, most media reports focused on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in work arrangements (e.g., short-time work, flexible location and hours) for workers in a regular employment relationship. We here focus on workers in flexible employment relationships (e.g. temporary agency work and other forms of subcontracted labor, as well as new forms of working, such as in the gig economy). Specifically, we will discuss (a) how the work and careers of individuals in flexible employment relationships might get affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) outline ideas how to examine period effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work and careers of those individuals, and (c) outline how the pandemic can contribute to the ramification of flexible employment relationships. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Despite all resources employed to counteract the spreading of the virus, additional global strategies are needed to handle the related mental health issues. Methods: Published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak and other previous global infections have been considered and reviewed. Comments: This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally. Collective concerns influence daily behaviors, economy, prevention strategies and decision-making from policy makers, health organizations and medical centers, which can weaken strategies of COVID-19 control and lead to more morbidity and mental health needs at global level. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus; COVID-19; mental health; Outbreak Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; global health; human; mental health; pandemic; pathogenicity; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral COVID-19 and older people in Asia: Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia calls to actions The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has casted a huge impact on global public health and the economy. In this challenging situation, older people are vulnerable to the infection and the secondary effects of the pandemic and need special attention. To evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on older people, it is important to balance the successful pandemic control and active management of secondary consequences. These considerations are particularly salient in the Asian context, with its diversity among countries in terms of sociocultural heritage, healthcare setup and availability of resources. Thus, the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia summarized the considerations of Asian countries focusing on responses and difficulties in each country, impacts of health inequity related to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed recommendations for older people, which are germane to the Asian context. More innovative services should be developed to address the increasing demands for new approaches to deliver healthcare in these difficult times and to establish resilient healthcare systems for older people.

To mitigate its impact on societies, health systems and economies, countries have adopted non-pharmacological preventive practices such as ‘spatial’ or ‘social’ distancing, the use of protective masks, and handwashing; these have been widely implemented. However, measures aimed at protecting physical health and healthcare systems have side-effects that might have a big impact on individuals’ wellbeing. As the pandemic reaches low- and middle-income countries, weaker health systems, limited resources and the lower socioeconomic status of their populations make halting the pandemic more challenging. In this article, we explore the impact of COVID-19 and its prevention measures on the wellbeing of vulnerable populations. Special attention must be given to homeless, indigenous, migrant and imprisoned populations, as well as people living with disabilities and the elderly. More than just resolute governmental action will be required to overcome the pandemic. Links between science and political actions have to be strengthened. Fighting COVID-19 is a collective endeavour and community action, on a global scale, is of paramount importance. © 2020 The Author(s) COVID-19; LMIC; Social distancing; Vulnerable populations; Wellbeing aged; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; disabled person; government; health care access; health care system; health service; homeless person; human; indigenous people; infection prevention; middle income country; migrant; misinformation; pandemic; prisoner; public health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social interaction; social status; vulnerable population; wellbeing; Coronavirus infection; developing country; health care planning; mental health; pandemic; psychology; social isolation; virus pneumonia; vulnerable population; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Developing Countries; Health Priorities; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Isolation; Vulnerable Populations Dietary diversity among chinese residents during the COVID-19 outbreak and its associated factors COVID-19, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, has imposed enormous challenges on the health system, economy, and food supply and has substantially modified people’s lifestyles. This study aimed to (1) explore the dietary diversity during the lockdown time in China and (2) examine factors associated with dietary diversity including socio-economic characteristics, sources for food and food purchases, and specific dietary behaviors responding to COVID-19 and isolation. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted online in March 2020. Multi-stage sampling was used to recruit participants living in Hubei Province and other parts of China. Dietary diversity was assessed using the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and clustering analysis was used to categorize people with different propensities of methods for purchasing or obtaining foods. Logistic regression was used to model the associations among HDDS, participants’ characteristics, approaches to purchase or obtain food, and behaviors adopted to cope with COVID-19. Results: A total of 1938 participants were included in the analysis. The overall mean HDDS was 9.7 ± 2.1, and the median (25th, 75th) was 10 (8, 12). There were relatively low consumptions of fish, legumes, and miscellaneous foods (e.g., processed food like snacks and beverages). After adjusting for age, family income, and geographic regions, people living in places where laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases were above 500 (ORadjusted = 0.79, 95%CI 0.65, 0.96), or living in Hubei Province (ORadjusted = 0.60, 95%CI 0.39, 0.93) had a lower HDDS. During isolation time, the most common sources for food and food purchases were in-house storage and in person grocery shopping. More than half of the participants (55.9%) purchased food at least once via online ordering and delivery services. There was no significant difference in HDDS among people with distinct dependences on different ways to obtain or purchase food (i.e., dependence on in-person grocery shopping, dependence on both in-house storage and in-person grocery shopping, or dependence on online food purchasing). We also identified a total of 37.7% participants who consumed certain foods or nutritional supplements to cope with COVID-19, which included vitamin C, probiotics, other dietary supplements, alcohol, and vinegar. People who reported these specific dietary behaviors had a significantly higher HDDS (ORadjusted = 1.23, 95%CI 1.02, 1.45) than those who did not do so. This study revealed an overall good dietary diversity among the studied Chinese residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we observed a lower dietary diversity among people living in areas with a high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Online ordering and delivery services were popular and could serve as a feasible method to obtain and purchase food, contributing to ensure diversified diets during the time of lockdown. Certain dietary behaviors associated with COVID-19 were also identified and had significant impacts on HDDS. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Currently routine surgical procedures are at a halt globally, but whether one can delay cancer procedures remains an ethical issue, and still there is no clarity on how women with gynaecological cancers should be managed in these critical times. Methods: Currently available literature on impact of COVID-19 on cancer was reviewed with special reference to its applicability to the Indian context. Results: Cancer cases are more susceptible for COVID-19 infection and rapid deterioration if they get infected. A tumour board should plan their management with a “do no harm” approach as the guiding principle. Teleconsultation may be used to advise patients for therapy and symptom control measures, as well as to advise new patients regarding diagnostic tests. Surgical decision making may be stratified into three categories: patients with low (not life threatening) or intermediate (potential for future morbidity or mortality) acuity may be delayed; those with high acuity may be taken up for planned therapy after explaining the risks. Assessment of the severity of disease, comorbid conditions, and logistic challenges, along with COVID census in their area are important variables for informed and individualized decision making. Safety of healthcare personnel needs to be ensured at the same time. Conclusion: Currently available evidence is limited by small sample size, and full impact of this pandemic on cancer is yet to be seen. However, cancer care needs to be individualized taking all variables into consideration. © 2020, Association of Gynecologic Oncologists of India.

It has caused a devastating effect on both daily lives, public health, and the global economy. It is critical to detect the positive cases as early as possible so as to prevent the further spread of this epidemic and to quickly treat affected patients. The need for auxiliary diagnostic tools has increased as there are no accurate automated toolkits available. Recent findings obtained using radiology imaging techniques suggest that such images contain salient information about the COVID-19 virus. Application of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques coupled with radiological imaging can be helpful for the accurate detection of this disease, and can also be assistive to overcome the problem of a lack of specialized physicians in remote villages. In this study, a new model for automatic COVID-19 detection using raw chest X-ray images is presented. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID vs. No-Findings) and multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced a classification accuracy of 98.08% for binary classes and 87.02% for multi-class cases. The DarkNet model was used in our study as a classifier for the you only look once (YOLO) real time object detection system. We implemented 17 convolutional layers and introduced different filtering on each layer. Our model (available at (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19)) can be employed to assist radiologists in validating their initial screening, and can also be employed via cloud to immediately screen patients. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Chest X-ray images; Coronavirus (COVID-19); Deep learning; Radiology images Diagnosis; Imaging techniques; Object detection; Viruses; Automated detection; Binary classification; Chest X-ray image; Classification accuracy; Devastating effects; Multi-class classification; Object detection systems; Radiological imaging; Deep neural networks; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; artificial intelligence; binary classification; computer assisted diagnosis; coronavirus disease 2019; deep learning; deep neural network; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; feature extraction; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiclass classification; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; thorax radiography; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; biology; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; Coronavirus infection; diagnostic imaging; factual database; lung; pandemic; pneumonia; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Computational Biology; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Deep Learning; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks, Computer; Pandemics; Pneumonia; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted Valuation of air pollution externalities: comparative assessment of economic damage and emission reduction under COVID-19 lockdown Air pollution (AP) is one of the major causes of health risks as it leads to widespread morbidity and mortality each year. Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities—Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2, and SO2 are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities. This helps in understanding the magnitude of actual damage and brings out a more holistic picture of the damages related to lockdown. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The effects of the pandemic on the world economic and political future [Covid-19: Crisi della globalizzazione e “Rivincita dei confini”. Le ricadute della pandemia sul futuro economico-politico mondiale] The rapid global spread of the Covid-19 virus has strongly highlighted, on multiple and transcalar levels, some problems that emerged worldwide after the end of bipolarism and the advent of the 21st century, i.e. the crisis of globalization and the “revenge of the borders”, which have clear repercussions on the world economic and political situation. The pandemic is entering a phase of global instability, linked to the tensions caused by the trade war between the United States and China, as well as the slowdown of the economy and the growth of populisms. In this sense, the consequences of the pandemic have caused the greatest shock to the international order since the Second World War. © 2020 Universita degli Studi di Roma Tor Vergata.

Covid-19; Deglobalization; Slowbalization  The spread of the Covid-19 pandemic in time and space As the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on public health and global economies in 2020; it is crucial to understand how it developed and spread in time and space. This paper contributes to the growing literature by considering the dynamics of country-wise growth rates of infection numbers. Low-order serial correlation of growth rates is predominantly negative with cycles of two to four days for most countries. The results of fitted spatial autoregressive models suggest that there is high degree of spillover between countries. Forecast variances of many countries, in particular those with a high absolute number of infections, can to a large extent be explained by structural innovations of other countries. A better understanding of the serial and spatial dynamics of the spread of the pandemic may contribute to an improved containment and risk management. © 2020 by the author.

It outlines the evolution of cases from 9 cases at the end of January to almost 7,000 cases by mid-May, of which 90% had recovered, 0.24% were in Intensive Care, 0.7% were in hospital and more than 900,000 tests had been performed. The paper maps out the Government’s response to COVID-19, the restrictions imposed and the economic stimulus provided, equating to 16.4% of Growth Domestic Product. It also identified the fines to be imposed upon those who ignored the restrictions. By mid-May the emphasis was not on “shutdowns” and restrictions but on a tempered and rational relaxation thereof with an aim to reinvigorate the economy. On 19th March, the Ruby Princess Cruise Ship docked in Sydney, creating the single greatest progenitor of positive cases and deaths associated with coronavirus in Australia, which ultimately resulted in police investigation and a Royal Commission. Other clusters were noted such as Anglicare Newmarch House Aged Care Facility, which also led to 18 deaths due to Coronavirus and together with the Ruby Princess accounted for 40 of the 45 deaths in New South Wales (NSW). The paper also identified other clusters, such as 88 cases associated with Cedar Meats Abattoir in Victoria and the closure of North West Regional Hospital and North West Private hospital in Tasmania. Not everyone respected the lockdown laws and the paper includes some high profile individuals, identified as having broken the rules and incurred heavy penalties, including a NSW Cabinet Minister, who was fined $1,000 AUD plus losing his State Government Cabinet position due to contravention of the Public Health Act. There were 4,500 Australians fined a minimum of $1,000 AUD for breaches of social distancing rules. By mid May 2020, it was apparent that there were definite lessons to be learnt from the Coronavirus Pandemic and the paper maps out some of these while also pointing out that such lessons will continue to emerge from the Pandemic and may well alter the approach to Pandemics into the future. © 2020, William S.

Australian Experience; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Lessons Learnt; Pandemic  A critical needs assessment for research in companion animals and livestock following the pandemic of COVID-19 in Humans Problem: The emergence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 and a growing body of information compel inquiry regarding the transmissibility of infection between humans and certain animal species. Although there are a number of issues to be considered, the following points are most urgent: The potential for domesticated (companion) animals to serve as a reservoir of infection contributing to continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread. The ramifications to food security, economy, and trade issues should coronavirus establish itself within livestock and poultry. The disruption to national security if SARS-CoV-2 and its fairly well-established effects on smell (hyposmia/anosmia) to critical military service animals including explosive detector dog, narcotics detector dog, specialized search dog, combat tracker dog, mine detection dog, tactical explosive detector dog, improvised explosive device detector dog, patrol explosive detector dog, and patrol narcotics detector dog, as well as multipurpose canines used by special operations such as used by the U.S. customs and border protection agency (e.g., Beagle Brigade). This article presents in chronological order data that both individually (as received independently from multiple countries) and collectively urge studies that elucidate the following questions. What animal species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the likely sources of infection, the period of infectivity, and transmissibility between these animals and to other animal species and humans? What are the best diagnostic tests currently available for companion animals and livestock? What expressions of illness in companion and other animal species can serve as disease markers? Although it is recognized that robust funding and methodology need to be identified to apply the best scientific investigation into these issues, there may be easily identifiable opportunities to capture information that can guide decision and study. First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers. If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created. Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, although companion animals and zoo species have repeatedly served as sentinels for emerging infectious diseases, they do not currently fall under the jurisdiction of any federal agency and are not under surveillance. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020. companion animals; coronavirus; COVID-19; livestock anosmia; beagle; coronavirus disease 2019; detection dog; dog; domestic animal; human; hyposmia; lethargy; livestock; needs assessment; nonhuman; pandemic; population density; poultry; priority journal; research; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus infectivity; virus transmission; zoonosis; animal; Betacoronavirus; bird disease; Coronavirus infection; dog disease; history; laboratory technique; livestock; needs assessment; pandemic; pathology; pet animal; smelling disorder; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Dog Diseases; Dogs; History, 21st Century; Humans; Livestock; Needs Assessment; Olfaction Disorders; Pandemics; Pets; Pneumonia, Viral; Poultry Diseases; Zoonoses Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on the Management of Patients with Cancer The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak is having a profound impact on the management of patients with cancer. In this review, we comprehensively investigate the various aspects of cancer care during the pandemic, taking advantage of data generated in Asia and Europe at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic spread. Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research. In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging. We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer. As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed. As the infection is spreading worldwide, we are obtaining more knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic consequences that are currently impacting and may continue to further challenge cancer care in several countries. © 2020, The Author(s).  arbidol; corticosteroid; ganciclovir; immunoglobulin; lopinavir plus ritonavir; ribavirin; antiviral therapy; Asia; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer research; cancer therapy; caregiver; computer assisted tomography; coronavirus disease 2019; emotional stress; health care; health care personnel; health care system; human; infection prevention; infection risk; mental health care; oncology ward; pandemic; patient isolation; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; socioeconomics; vulnerable population Global COVID-19: Warnings and suggestions based on experience of China Background Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading around the world currently, seriously threatening people's health and global security as an international public health emergency. The objective of this study is to summarize China's countermeasures and experience in response to the COVID-19 emergence in order to serve as a warning for the global COVID-19 prevention and control, and further provide some suggestions for global fighting to COVID-19. Methods Content analysis, expert consultation, and high frequency word analysis were applied in this study. Relevant data and information were collected from official websites, the experience accumulated in China during the fighting to the novel coronavirus, and suggestions from some experts. Results As of March 29, 2020, China had accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.01%; in the mean time, the global had accumulated 596 042 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.76%. Although the mortality of COVID-19 was not so high, its harmfulness couldn't be ignored. Ten facts during COVID-19 epidemic in China were summarized in the study, including: the COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread through many channels; although elderly people and people with underlying diseases are susceptible, young people can also be victims; isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and secondary disasters induced by COVID-19 should be emphasized in advance. High frequent words of experts' suggestions mainly includes: material, prevention and control, pathogeny, propaganda, education, hygiene, technology, medical care, overall planning, policy, panic, etc. The main concerns of experts are from four aspects: publicity and education, various subjects, medical materials and law construction. Conclusions COVID-19 is a new infectious disease worldwide, and its infectious source, transmission route, susceptible population, and therapy are not clear. In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, no country can stand alone to maintain its own safety. People from all over the world should put aside their difference in ideology, religious belief, politics, economy, and culture, and only by global cooperation and globally unified actions, can we successfully overcome COVID-19 in the end. © 2020 The Author(s).

Medical colleges and universities are facing challenges to provide quality education to their students during this prolonged period of lockdown. Technologically advanced countries have systems in place for e-learning and online medical education. This is not the case with most of the low-income countries like Pakistan. Here, we describe the challenges being faced by medical faculty members and students in Pakistan while engaging in online medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include lack of faculty training and institutional support, internet connectivity issues, maintaining student engagement, online assessments, and problems with understanding the unique dynamics of online education. A collaborative approach involving all stakeholders, intuitional support, use of free online training resources, and out of box thinking can help overcome these challenges. © 2020 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.

Member States' divergent responses to this crisis reveal a lack of unity in the face of a humanitarian catastrophe. At best, this undermines the effectiveness of health protection within the European Union (EU). At worst, it risks breaking up the Union altogether. Divergent national responses to COVID-19 reflect different national preferences and political legitimacy, and thus cannot be completely avoided. In this article, we argue that these responses should be better coordinated. Without coordination, the price for diversity is high. Firstly, there are damaging spill-overs between Member States, which undermine key pillars of European integration such as the free movement of persons and of goods. Secondly, national policy-making is easily captured by local interest groups. Our proposal is that the EU indicates - not mandates - a European exit strategy from asymmetric containment policies of COVID-19. In particular, the EU should help Member States procure and validate tests for infection and immunity. The EU should also indicate ways in which testing could be used to create safe spaces to work, thereby restoring the free movement of persons and of goods. We see a great advantage in such EU guidance: it could improve mutual learning between Member States, which have faced different timings of the epidemic and learned different lessons. Although the local political economy has so far delayed learning and undermined cooperation, the EU can mitigate both effects and indicate the way for Europe to resurrect united from the ashes of COVID-19. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Artificial intelligence in the agri-food system: Rethinking sustainable business models in the COVID-19 scenario The aim of the paper is to investigate the artificial intelligence (AI) function in agri-food industry, as well as the role of stakeholders in its supply chain. Above all, from the beginning of the new millennium, scholars and practitioners have paid an increasing attention to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in operational processes management and challenges for new business models, in a sustainable and socially responsible perspective. Thus, the stakeholders can assume a proactive or marginal role in the value creation for business, according to their own environmental awareness. These issues appear still ""open"" in some industries, such as the agri-food system, where the adoption of new technologies requires rethinking and redesigning the whole business model. Methodologically, we brought forward an in-depth review of the literature about major articles in this field. Especially, the study has been conducted following two phases: firstly, we extracted from scientific databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar) and studied relevant articles; secondly, we analyzed the selected articles. The findings highlight interesting issues about AI towards a ""space economy"" to achieve sustainable and responsible business models, also in the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2020 by the authors.

Evidence from smooth time-varying cointegration analysis Background: The stimulus coupon plan is one of the economic relief plans used to boost Taiwan's slumping economy in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. In order to obtain prior information to understand whether or not the stimulus coupon plan would effectively revive the economy in advance, the purpose of this study is to learn lessons from Taiwan's consumption voucher scheme initiated during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis through evaluating the effect of the consumption voucher scheme on private consumption expenditure. Methods: The smooth time-varying cointegration analysis was applied to estimate the income elasticity of consumption, indicating the individual's reaction to consumption vouchers in terms of private consumption expenditure, and then the multiple structural change model was estimated to identify endogenous regime changes of the income elasticity of consumption. Results: We found that the income elasticity of consumption dramatically decreased after 2007Q1, a period that covered the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007-2009 and the time of issuance of the consumption vouchers in 2009. Conclusions: We concluded that Taiwan's consumption voucher scheme might have had either no or little effect on stimulating the economy, so policymakers should be cautioned concerning the potential ineffectiveness of the stimulus coupon plan in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

Arguably, agricultural producers and the retail industry appear to be the best placed to weather the storm in order to respond to such a change in demand. However, this is overly simplistic.

Why Do COVID-19 Fatality Rates Differ Across Countries? An Explorative Cross-country Study Based on Select Indicators In this article, we analyse the factors that determine the fatality rates across 29 economies spread across both the developing and developed world. Recent emerging literature and expert opinions in popular media have indicated various factors that may explain cross-country difference in fatality rates. These factors range from access to public health infrastructure, BCG vaccination policies, demographic structure, restrictive policy interventions and the weather. In addition, articles are examining different kinds of fatality rates that can be explained. Progressing beyond fragmented databases and anecdotal evidence, we have developed a database for such factors, have explored various econometric models to test the explanatory power of these factors in explaining several kinds of fatality rates. Based on available data, our study reveals that factors such as public health system, population age structure, poverty level and BCG vaccination are powerful contributory factors in determining fatality rates. Interactions between factors such as poverty level and BCG vaccination provide interesting insights into the complex interplay of factors. Our analysis suggests that poor citizens’ access to the public healthcare system are worse in many countries irrespective of whether they are developed or developing countries. © 2020 International Management Institute, New Delhi. aged population; BCG vaccination policy; China; COVID-19; Europe; fatality rate; Germany; public health; South Korea; USA  Modelling the Economic Impact and Ripple Effects of Disease Outbreaks The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has had alarming effects on human lives and the economies of affected countries. With the world’s manufacturing hubs experiencing a period of extended factory closures, the economic impact transcends territorial borders via global supply chains. This paper provides a roadmap on how to evaluate the vulnerability that cascades through the supply chain due to a disease outbreak at the firm level, national level, and global scale. The final extent of losses is not yet known, but the development of economic models combined with epidemiological models and network analysis techniques can yield more realistic estimates to select appropriate strategies in a timely manner. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

The surging number of deaths every day, global lockdown and travel restrictions have resulted in huge losses to society. The impact is massive and will leave a historical footprint. The Spanish Flu of 1918, which was the last pandemic that had a similar impact, was shadowed under the consequences of World War I. All the brilliance, strength and economies of countries worldwide are aimed at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The knowledge about coronavirus dynamics, its nature and epidemiology are expanding every day. The present review aims to summarize the structure, epidemiology, symptoms, statistical status of the disease status, intervention strategies and deliberates the lessons learnt during the pandemic. The intervention approaches, antiviral drug repurposing and vaccine trials are intensified now. Statistical interpretations of disease dynamics and their projections may help the decision-makers. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2  A review on sars-cov-2 virology, pathophysiology, animal models, and anti-viral interventions Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic and transmissible CoV that is presently plaguing the global human population and economy. No proven effective antiviral therapy or vaccine currently exists, and supportive care remains to be the cornerstone treatment. Through previous lessons learned from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV studies, scientific groups worldwide have rapidly expanded the knowledge pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 virology that includes in vitro and in vivo models for testing of antiviral therapies and randomized clinical trials. In the present narrative, we review SARS-CoV-2 virology, clinical features, pathophysiology, and animal models with a specific focus on the antiviral and adjunctive therapies currently being tested or that require testing in animal models and randomized clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors.

However, due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal is not only going to lose a significant portion of remittances but will also face the Herculean task of creating employment for the workforce who may return to Nepal. This paper discusses sustainable options for the Nepali government to help create employment for its citizens in Nepal through the revitalization of fallow lands and other potential agricultural areas, which are below a 15° slope. The land-use and land-cover data for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are derived from the classification of satellite images. These classified and resampled 30 m × 30 m images along with the 30 × 30 m elevation data are brought to the Kibana Platform within the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to analyze the status of land-use and-cover conditions for the 1980 to 2010 period within nine different slope classes at an interval of 5° slope. Our findings suggest there have been massive conversions of forested areas for agricultural land at lower slope areas between 1980 and 2000, but the trend began to reverse from 2000 to 2010 as trees started coming back to the fallow agricultural lands. This happened mainly because, during the countrywide Maoist insurgency period (1996–2006), many youth first took shelter in various urban centers away from their natal homes and then emigrated to foreign countries for remittance purposes. As a result, many farmlands became fallow and barren, and agricultural productivity decreased. Consequently, Nepal, an exporter of rice and pulses until the late 1980s, started importing food grain each year. The major goals of this research are to explore: (a) if Nepal can self-sustain in agricultural products by utilizing potential agricultural lands below a 15° slope in various geographic regions; (b) the means for productively engaging the youth returning to the country; and (c) methods of reinvigorating the ecosystem services of Nepal to support sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

In this overview accompanying the Special Issue of Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews, we examine some of the many social and scientific issues impacted by SARS-CoV2 – personal lives, economy, scientific communication, the environment.

Density is associated with the notion of intensity. Intensity in social interaction is key to innovation and creativity in science, culture, and the economy. From an environmental point of view, density is crucial for the reduction of the urban footprint and lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions. One of the most urgent challenges that cities face is solving the contradiction between densification, understood as putting a rational limit to land use, and disperse growth, which in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic seems better suited for social distancing. Socialdistancing measures during the COVID-19 health emergency have stressed the importance of linkages between individuals and different groups. Moreover, they have highlighted the advantages of living in places where access to essential services is within walking distance, as well as the collateral benefits of mobility reduction. On the other hand, the conflict between road space, designed solely for the car, and spatial requirements for pedestrian mobility, as well as for economic activities at street level, has become ever more evident. Our productive homes, where work activity, family care, social connection, and personal intimacy have coexisted during the lock-down, are the forerunners of a deep transformation in residential architecture. In order to manage present-day urban complexity, it is not enough to plan or design the city which we can see. But the deepest change must take place in a renovation of the dialectics between the public and private spheres, incorporating both social and temporal dimensions into the spatial plans for the city. © 2020, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

This paper provides an initial understanding of some driving factors and their consequences. Since transmission requires people, the human factor behind globalisation is essential. Globalisation, a major force behind global well-being and equality, is highly associated with this factor. The analysis investigates the impact globalisation has on the speed of initial transmission to a country and on the scale of initial infections in the context of other driving factors. Our cross-country analysis finds that measures of globalisation are positively related to the spread of the virus, both in speed and in scale. However, the study also finds that globalised countries are better equipped to keep fatality rates low. The conclusion is not to reduce globalisation to avoid pandemics, but to better monitor the human factor at the outbreak and mobilise collaboration forces to curtail diseases. © 2020 The Authors.

By mid-February 2020, China, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and – to some extent – Japan began to contain and control the spread of the virus, while conversely, cases increased rapidly in Europe and the United States. In response to the pandemic, many countries have had to introduce drastic legally mandated lockdowns to enforce physical separation, which are ravaging economies worldwide. Although it will be many months or even years before the final verdict can be reached, we believe that it is already possible to identify 12 key lessons that we can learn from to reduce the tremendous economic and social costs of this pandemic and which can inform responses to future crises. These include lessons around the importance of transparency, solidarity, coordination, decisiveness, clarity, accountability and more. © 2020 The Author(s) Covid-19; Pandemic; Policy responses; Policy-making artificial intelligence; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; economic aspect; European Union; health care cost; health care policy; health care system; health insurance; human; interpersonal communication; leadership; pandemic; patient care; politics; Review; robotics; social aspect; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; legislation and jurisprudence; pandemic; social responsibility; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Policy; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Responsibility Rising inequality and entrepreneurship during economic downturn: An analysis of opportunity and necessity entrepreneurship in Spain There is a consensus among researchers that one of the most important effects of the recent economic downturn that started in 2009-also known as the Great Recession-in Spain has been rising income inequality. In this context, researchers are concerned about the effects of inequality on the economy, and this concern is even more marked now, when the world is facing a new crisis that seems the equal of, or even more devastating than the last Great Recession as a consequence of Covid-19. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies which consider the effects of inequality on entrepreneurship. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between inequality and entrepreneurship in the context of an economic downturn. We focus on the 17 autonomous communities in Spain during the Great Recession (2007-2013). Using unbalanced panel data, we study the effect on entrepreneurial activity, differentiating between total, necessity-and opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, our results offer new empirical evidence concerning the relationship between growing inequality and entrepreneurial activity, showing significant differences from results in the existing literature. Second, we explain how, in a recessionary context of highly restricted financial resources, inequality can negatively affect total, necessity-and opportunity-based entrepreneurship, preventing a large part of the population from engaging in this activity. © 2020 by the authors.

For a long time, the EU has tried to brand itself as a global actor from a 'normative power' perspective, able to 'export' values and norms without having an army of its own. Nonetheless, shortly after the Brexit referendum of 2016, the EU has announced its Global Strategy, while France and Germany launched the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) initiative in the field of defence, formally adopted by EU in 2017. In the midst of a growing strategic competition for influence, aggravated by the 2020 pandemics of COVID-19, the Great Powers diversify their leverage, resources and instruments. With increasing rifts in its partnership with the US and concerning uncertainties in relation to the UK, against a background characterized by the disintegration of the West as a political concept, having difficult relations with Russia and China, the EU reconsiders the issue of security. This article explores the international context from the perspective of the relations between the global actors, a changing world order and the re-interpretation of the concepts of security and hard power. We shall analyse both the discourses of political leaders on the topic, and the EU decision-making process in the field of security. © 2019 European Institute of Romania.

This thesis was particularly confirmed by the global events of the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, when the spread of the COVID-19 virus revealed the helplessness of humanity in the face of a pandemic. Only intensive scientific work, having an interdisciplinary character, gives hope to stop the development of the spread of the virus. It turned out that it is scientists who are necessary to reduce mortality and morbidity, as well as the negative effects of a pandemic on the economy and public health. In this regard, it is worth discussing whether the scientific work of scientists is satisfying for them? Nowadays, the scientist is demanded for immediate effects of scientific research, implementation of inventions tailored to the emerging needs, and quick solutions to the problems of a dynamically changing society. However, along with the growing social expectations towards researchers, is their work increasingly appreciated? The aim of this article is getting to assess the level of satisfaction with scientific work among researchers and to identify the factors that influence its level. The article presents the results of research conducted on a random sample of 763 academics from Poland. The conducted scientific studies have established that: (1) The level of satisfaction of researchers concerning their own scientific work depends on employment conditions, as well as the social significance of the research carried out, (2) the level of satisfaction from work is closely correlated with the scientific opportunities of researchers (that is, the possibility of academic and didactic work, contact with students and co-workers) and negatively correlated with the necessity to carry out administrative work, and (3) the majority of Polish researchers are proud of their scientific achievements and treat their profession as a passion or vocation. © 2020 by the authors.

Their infectious nature is one of the main reasons for the probable health impacts. The COVID-19 crisis that is presently affecting all countries around the world is a true testament to the characteristic nature of a virus. We have already seen the disastrous nature of this virus affecting millions of people and its capacity to ruin the global economy. So, the rush of the hour is to find prompt diagnosis and effective treatment for achieving virus control and its total elimination. The current development of nanomaterials with its unique features and functions has brought out a chain of applications and technologies that could curb this crisis. In this article, we will review the literature already existing and provide a summary of the current developments of nanoparticles proposed that are presently under extensive research and clinical trials that are predicted to considerably improve the COVID-19 crisis. © (2020) Society for Biomaterials & Artificial Organs #20041120  Clinical research; Nanoparticles; Clinical trial; Global economies; Health impact; Human health; Unique features; Viruses Modeling the Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Regional Industry Risk Contagion [新冠肺炎疫情影响下区域产业网络风险传导效应研究] The outbreak and rapid spread of Covid-19 epidemic have brought severe challenges to the regional economy of China. The epidemic has led to interruptions in supply and decline in demand in some industries, causing supply chain risk spread through the industry chain to the entire network, which is very likely to trigger systemic risks. In order to simulate the risk contagion effect of the regional industrial supply chain under the influence of the epidemic, a network cascading failure model based on China's regional industrial network is proposed. We simulate the propagation of production suspension and liquidity risk in the case of unexpected interruption of supply and decline in demand in Hubei province as well as the rest part of China. The results show that risk propagation exhibits an abrupt transition with a critical time point. The risk spread is relatively slow and stable before the critical point. Once the critical point is exceeded, the accelerated spread makes the entire industrial network blackout in a short period. We also show that under the impact of supply-side and demand-side shocks, different industries have heterogeneous effects on systemic risk levels. re industrial network blackout in a short period. We also show that different industries have heterogeneous impact on systemic risk of the industry network under shocks from supply and demand side. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

This is of particular concern for nations with weaker health systems. This article reports the response of a comprehensive cancer centre in a lower-middle income country to prevent COVID-19 transmission and how the implementation of pragmatic strategies have served as a springboard to improve cancer services beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies included establishment of a local taskforce, increased education and facilitation of good hygiene practices, staff training, patient triaging, improved patient scheduling, remote review of patients and establishing a virtual platform for meetings. © the authors; licensee ecancermedicalscience.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cultural economy poses a significant threat to inclusion and workforce diversity. This article combines pre-COVID-19 research with emerging industry and policy evidence to identify where key impacts on inclusive practice and, consequently, workforce participation and advancement in the cultural economy are likely to occur. The article demonstrates how considering the cultural economy’s typical business models and resultant work and employment practices allows understanding that the inclusion and diversity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be driven by more than workers’ differing abilities to buffer short-term income insecurity. The article highlights four areas relevant to inclusion and workforce diversity that research and policy responses to COVID-19 should attend to in revising existing and designing new responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

We discuss the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental effects of shuttering the tournament and suggest that an understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to bring about an alternative, more sustainable sports tourism economy. The cancellation of March Madness resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in tourism revenue for local economies and deprived traveler-fans of pilgrimages to arenas, important socio-cultural gathering spaces for American basketball fans. However, it also prevented the emission of a sizable quantity of greenhouse gasses based on our carbon footprint calculated from the previous year’s tournament. Ultimately, from the disruptive closing down of sport and event tourism, a post-pandemic sports tourism landscape should emerge that takes more seriously the triple-bottom line notion of balancing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the creation and maintenance of resilient local economies all while both acknowledging the important role sport plays in society and keeping tourism actors healthy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. carbon footprint; coronavirus; COVID-19; local economies; sport; Sustainable tourism COVID-19; economic impact; epidemic; health status; respiratory disease; sport; sustainability; tourism economics; tourism market; viral disease; United States; Coronavirus Reflections and discussions: tourism matters in the new normal post COVID-19 [краткое описание не найдено] community; COVID-19; economy; future; globalization; inequalities; local; matters; sustainability; tourism  Costing of actions to safeguard vulnerable Mexican households with young children from the consequences of COVID-19 social distancing measures COVID-19 has imposed unprecedented challenges to society. As the pandemic evolves, the social distancing measures that have been globally enforced, while essential, are having undesirable socioeconomic side effects particularly among vulnerable populations. In Mexico, families who depend upon informal employment face increased threats to their wellbeing, and households who in addition have young children may face long-term consequences. The Mexican government has not yet taken actions, but a coalition of non-governmental organizations is advocating in partnership with academic institutions for social protection actions such as a cash transfer and basic services subsidies for families with young children, subsisting from the informal sector economy. To facilitate governmental action, we estimated the costs for implementation of these recommendations. The methodology used could be replicated in other countries facing similar challenges. © 2020 The Author(s).

The events of the current COVID-19 pandemic have further emphasised existing issues within our health systems. There is no better time than now to come together in global solidarity to tackle these evolving threats of COVID-19 pandemic. The Commonwealth is an ideally placed network to tackle these global health challenges, with its wide-reaching networks of governmental, non-governmental and civil society organisations across all continents. Although the biennial Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) originally scheduled to take place in Kigali in Rwanda 22-27 June 2020 has been postponed in view of COVID-19, Commonwealth country discussions are continuing, centred on the CHOGM key theme of 'Delivering a Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming', and five subthemes of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and Innovation; Trade; Environment; Governance and the Rule of Law; and Youth. The planned CHOGM and Commonwealth itself provides all members a timely platform to consider innovative ways to connect, innovate and transform healthcare to meet the needs of their populations. This commentary considers these five CHOGM subthemes and how member nations can be supported to achieve universal health coverage through optimising medicines use and outcomes, in the midst of a global pandemic in line with the global health agenda. © 2020 The Author(s).

As the disease continues to spread rapidly, the development of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches is urgently required. Although some progress has been made in understanding the viral structure and invasion mechanism of coronaviruses that may cause severe cases of the syndrome, due to the limited understanding of the immune effects caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is difficult for us to prevent patients from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the major complications of coronavirus infection. Therefore, any potential treatments should focus not only on direct killing of coronaviruses and prevention strategies by vaccine development, but also on keeping in check the acute immune/inflammatory responses, resulting in ARDS and PF. In addition, potential treatments currently under clinical trials focusing on killing coronaviruses or on developing vaccines preventing coronavirus infection largely ignore the host immune response. However, taking care of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with ARDS and PF is considered to be the major difficulty. Therefore, further understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important for clinical resolution and saving medication cost. In addition to a breif overview of the structure, infection mechanism, and possible therapeutic approaches, we summarized and compared the hematopathologic effect and immune responses to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also discussed the indirect immune response caused by SARS and direct infection, replication, and destroying of immune cells by MERS-CoV. The molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection-induced lymphopenia or cytokine storm may provide some hint toward fight against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. This may provide guidance over using immune therapy as a combined treatment to prevent patients developing severe respiratory syndrome and largely reduce complications. © Copyright © 2020 Liang, Wang, Chien, Yarmishyn, Yang, Lai, Luo, Lin, Chen, Chang and Chiou. hematopathologic effect; immune responses; immune therapy; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; hemagglutinin; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; interferon; interleukin 2; interleukin 7; M protein; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; membrane protein; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; nucleocapsid protein; tumor necrosis factor; virus envelope protein; adult respiratory distress syndrome; amino terminal sequence; antibody response; antigen presenting cell; apoptosis; B lymphocyte; carboxy terminal sequence; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; coronavirus disease 2019; cryoelectron microscopy; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; dendritic cell; electron tomography; Feline coronavirus; hematopathology; hemophagocytic syndrome; histone modification; human; humoral immunity; immune response; inflammation; innate immunity; lung fibrosis; macrophage; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; monocyte; nonhuman; pathology; protein motif; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; upregulation; virus load; virus morphology; virus replication; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; pathology; severe acute respiratory syndrome; virology; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Inflammation; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Virus Replication Exit strategy to control covid-19 and relaunch the economy [краткое описание не найдено]  communicable disease control; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; economics; epidemic; human; infection control; isolation; Letter; priority journal; quarantine; virus transmission; Betacoronavirus; commercial phenomena; Coronavirus infection; economics; health care policy; infection control; pandemic; procedures; public health; quarantine; United Kingdom; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Commerce; Communicable Disease Control; Contact Tracing; Coronavirus Infections; Health Policy; Humans; Infection Control; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Quarantine; United Kingdom Rationality Analysis of the Treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with Reduning Injection [热毒宁注射液的快速卫生技术评估及其应用于新型冠状病毒肺炎的药学分析和监护] OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and rationality of Reduning injection in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Through consulting, summarizing and analyzing literatures, the rapid HTA evaluation of Reduning was carried out, and its pharmacological rationality and drug monitoring for COVID-19 were discussed. RESULTS: Literature analysis indicated that COVID-19 belongs to the pestilence of TCM. It was characterized by “dampness, heat, deficiency, toxin and stasis”, and its clinical manifestations involved inflammatory factor storm, immune system damage, etc. Reduning injection was approved to the treatment of influenza, cough and respiratory tract infections caused by exopathic wind-heat, and a typical drug for heat-clearing and detoxifying. CONCLUSION: The rapid HTA evaluation showed that Reduning injection has good safety, effectiveness and economy. The mechanisms of Reduning in antipyretic and anti-inflammatory, immune regulation and anti-virus suggest the rationality of Reduning in treating COVID-19, but drug monitoring should be done well in the use process.

A space remote sensing dynamic monitoring system for urban complex is proposed and constructed from the aspects of application demand, technical method, remote sensing products, management release, etc. Using the system, the construction progress and surrounding water environment monitoring of the urban complex of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital are carried out. The construction progress of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital is monitored by high-resolution optical satellites such as Gaofen-2, Jilin-1 and Pleiades, which is identical with the construction progress in the news report and the officially published hospital area. The construction intensity of Huoshenshan Hospital is monitored by the high-resolution night light satellite Jilin-1, most areas of the construction plant are under high-intensity construction at night. The water environment around Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital is monitored by the hyperspectral satellite Zhuhai-1, the construction process has no significant impact on the surrounding water environment. The surface stability of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital before construction is analyzed by the high-resolution radar satellite Sentinel-1A, there is no obvious surface subsidence in the construction area of Huoshenshan Hospital, and there are different degrees of surface subsidence signals in the surrounding areas of Leishenshan Hospital. In the critical period of fighting against the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), it has met the public’s attention needs and plays a certain role in stabilizing social mood. A retrospective monitoring of the collapse of Xinjia hotel in Quanzhou is carried out to provide data reference for accident liability analysis. The deformation of Xinjia hotel is mainly caused by the south wall, and the foundation settlement is not obvious. This result is consistent with the fact that the hotel collapses to the south, and the main reason for the collapse is the instability of the internal structure of the building, rather than the uneven ground settlement. The effectiveness of the system is verified. © 2020, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University. All right reserved.

In this survey, we examine the impact of the outbreak on the Indonesian economy, as well as the government’s response to the public health crisis and its provisions for the emerging economic crisis. Indonesia’s delay in responding to the health crisis while Covid-19 spread in neighbouring countries in January–February 2020 has been costly for the health of the population. The government’s policy responses have so far been aimed at steadying the ship, addressing both the needs of the poor and the potentially poor (vulnerable) groups. At the time of writing, Covid-19 had not been tamed in Indonesia by any means. Hence, its implications for economic growth, jobs and welfare remained uncertain, as policy discussions were all about opening up the economy from virus-imposed restrictions across the country, under what has been termed the ‘new normal’. © 2020 ANU Indonesia Project.

Being a close relative of Bat corona-virus, SARS and MERS it’s structural and sequence similarity has abled scientists for repurposing of popular drugs like hydroxychloroquine, cloroquine and also scavenging for lead molecules by in-silico and in-vivo or in-vitro approach. The potent drug targets are ACE2; spike protein binding receptor to host cell surface, Mpro; proteo-lytic polyprotein processing enzymes needed for virion maturation and RdRp; RNA dependent RNA polymerase needed for RNA replication. The recent trend focuses on the fact that cocktail of anti-corona virus treatment will be available soon by broad spectrum antiviral compounds. It takes time to develop such drug targets till then social distancing and following of hygiene are the only way to thrive well. This article incorporates the present World scenario related to COVID infection, focuses on its origin and also future possibilities for a COVID free future. © The Author(s) 2020.

In this paper, a structural equation (SEM) model was proposed to compare risk knowledge, risk perception, risk aversion attitudes and behavioral intentions towards rural tourism. According to the empirical results, there was a large proportion of tourists showing preference for rural tourism recently. Potential participants in rural tourism paid most attention to the performance realization and time cost of scenic spots, while the psycho-social risk posed by COVID-19 had little impact. The inherent risk nature of risk aversion attitudes made knowledge of the pneumonia risk less effective in reducing tourists’ intentions, while knowledge of the pneumonia risk was more effective in alleviating the risk perception that potential tourists have towards rural tourism. With regard to travel intention and recommendation intention of rural tourism, the negative impacts of risk aversion attitude were more considerable compared to risk perception. Meanwhile, the parallel mediating effect of risk perception and risk aversion attitude in rural tourism needed to be taken into consideration together. © 2020 by the authors.

Global economies are also spiraling towards a recession in fear of this new life-threatening disease. Vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and therapeutics that reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 are thus urgently needed. A rapid method to derive antiviral treatment for Covid-19 is the use of convalescent plasma derived hyperimmune globulin. However, both hyperimmune globulin and vaccine development face a common hurdle – the risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement. The goal of this review is to examine the body of evidence supporting the hypothesis of immune enhancement that could be pertinent to Covid-19. We also discuss how this risk could be mitigated so that both hyperimmune globulin and vaccines could be rapidly translated to overcome the current global health crisis. © 2020 The Author(s) Coronavirus; COVID-19; Polyclonal hyperimmune globulin; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccines Fc receptor; gamma interferon; hyperimmune globulin; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin G; interferon; leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor subfamily B member 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; virus spike protein; virus vaccine; COVID-19 vaccine; Fc receptor; virus antibody; virus vaccine; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; antibody mediated rejection; antibody response; antiviral therapy; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell stress; clinical trial (topic); coronavirus disease 2019; Dengue virus; feline infectious peritonitis; Feline infectious peritonitis virus; gene expression; human; immunity; immunopathology; immunostimulation; inflammation; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; nonhuman; pandemic; priority journal; protein expression; Review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; vaccination; virus load; animal; animal model; convalescence; Coronavirus infection; dendritic cell; global health; immunology; macrophage; monocyte; pandemic; passive immunization; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); plasma; plasmapheresis; translational research; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic; Convalescence; Coronavirus Infections; Dendritic Cells; Global Health; Host Microbial Interactions; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Macrophages; Models, Animal; Monocytes; Pandemics; Plasma; Plasmapheresis; Pneumonia, Viral; Receptors, Fc; Translational Medical Research; Viral Vaccines; Virus Internalization COVID-19 for the Cardiologist: Basic Virology, Epidemiology, Cardiac Manifestations, and Potential Therapeutic Strategies Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has reached pandemic status. As it spreads across the world, it has overwhelmed health care systems, strangled the global economy, and led to a devastating loss of life. Widespread efforts from regulators, clinicians, and scientists are driving a rapid expansion of knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. The authors review the most current data, with a focus on the basic understanding of the mechanism(s) of disease and translation to the clinical syndrome and potential therapeutics. The authors discuss the basic virology, epidemiology, clinical manifestation, multiorgan consequences, and outcomes. With a focus on cardiovascular complications, they propose several mechanisms of injury. The virology and potential mechanism of injury form the basis for a discussion of potential disease-modifying therapies. © 2020 cardiovascular; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; treatments; virology angiotensin converting enzyme 2; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antiinflammatory agent; azithromycin; camostat; chloroquine; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hydroxychloroquine; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; neutralizing antibody; nucleotide derivative; proteinase inhibitor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine; siltuximab; unclassified drug; viral protein; virus vaccine; acute coronary syndrome; cardiogenic shock; cardiologist; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart injury; heart muscle injury; human; infection control; kidney injury; life cycle; liver injury; membrane fusion; mortality; myocarditis; nonhuman; oxygen supply; patient care; resource allocation; respiratory failure; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; takotsubo cardiomyopathy; thrombosis; viral genetics; virology; virus genome; virus morphology; virus transmission Avaliacao de tecnologias em saude: Tensoes metodologicas durante a pandemia de Covid-19 Covid-19 is a global threat that attracts researchers from all areas to understand the natural history of the disease and its epidemiological parameters. The technological development of vaccines, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic targets has mobilized many resources in a short time. Health technology assessment (HTA), based on a systematic analysis of the properties, effects and/or impacts of health technologies through internationally-validated methods and instruments to assess the quality and methodological rigor of studies that demonstrate effectiveness, efficacy, and safety, is under unprecedented pressure due to the pandemic. This article also reflects on the emergency authorization of the use of treatments and diagnostic tests that conflict with HTA precepts. We will also evaluate non-pharmacological technologies of containment of the disease and their impacts on the domestic and international economy, as well as the judicial interventions that impact the decisions of managers in the exceptional context of the covid-19 pandemic. © 2020 Instituto de Estudos Avancados da Universidade de Sao Paulo.

We are not only in a “pandemic” but also an “infodemic”. Health literacy is more important than ever in the face of these global health threats, which have impacted outcomes across the levels of the socio-ecological model (SEM), including individual health behaviors, family relationships, organizational behavior, state policy-making, national mortality statistics, and the international economy in the span of weeks. Our special issue sought to pull together interdisciplinary threads guided by two principles. The first was defining health literacy as essential skills and situational resources needed for people to find, understand, evaluate, communicate, and use information and services in a variety of forms across various settings throughout their life course to promote health and wellbeing. The second was the idea that enhancing health literacy in populations and systems is critical to achieving health equity. In this time of public health need across traditional borders, the inter-sectoral and international perspectives of special issue articles are more urgent than ever. A greater understanding, appreciation, and application of health literacy can support policy action on multiple levels to address major public health challenges. Health literacy should be built deliberately as a population-level resource and community asset. We have summarized the set of articles in this special issue across the levels of the SEM, hoping their thoughtful considerations and interesting findings will help to support global health and wellness and inspire future research, policy, and practice in this global public health emergency and beyond. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the global effect of this pandemic has been devastating. Billions of people are in lockdown and isolation on six continents around the world. Most have easy access to information due to internet connectivity and electronic media, which has helped share information about the pandemic. However, information overload during the current COVID-19 pandemic has posed a set of challenges not encountered before. There is an ""infodemic"" in which false news, conspiracy theories, magical cures and racist news are being shared at an alarming rate, with the potential to increase anxiety and stress and even lead to loss of life. This review highlights some of these challenges and suggests general measures to avoid information overload and infodemic in the connected world of 21st century. © 2020 Pakistan Medical Association.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 2019-CoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; potential interventions; SARS alpha tocopherol; antivirus agent; ascorbic acid; chloroquine; cinanserin; cyclosporine; diarylheptanoid derivative; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; emodin; flavonoid; immunoglobulin; interferon; iron; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monoclonal antibody; nelfinavir; nicotianamine; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; promazine; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; retinol; ribavirin; selenium; thymopentin; thymosin alpha1; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin B group; zinc; COVID-19; immunologic factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trace element; virus vaccine; vitamin; antiviral therapy; China; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; diet therapy; human; infection control; nonhuman; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus infection; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; nutritional status; passive immunization; pathogenicity; plasma; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Immunologic Factors; Nutritional Status; Plasma; Pneumonia, Viral; Trace Elements; Viral Vaccines; Vitamins On the Macroeconomic and Social Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic in Latin America and the Developing World While the COVID-19 pandemic posits a significant challenge to all societies around the world, it also reveals in the most dramatic manner the many abysmal differences between so-called advanced economies and the developing world. © 2020, The Author(s).   How digital natives learn and thrive in the digital age: Evidence from an emerging economy As a generation of 'digital natives,' secondary students who were born from 2002 to 2010 have various approaches to acquiring digital knowledge. Digital literacy and resilience are crucial for them to navigate the digital world as much as the real world; however, these remain under-researched subjects, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, the education system has put considerable effort into teaching students these skills to promote quality education as part of the United Nations-defined Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). This issue has proven especially salient amid the COVID??19 pandemic lockdowns, which had obliged most schools to switch to online forms of teaching. This study, which utilizes a dataset of 1061 Vietnamese students taken from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s ""Digital Kids Asia Pacific (DKAP)"" project, employs Bayesian statistics to explore the relationship between the students' background and their digital abilities. Results show that economic status and parents' level of education are positively correlated with digital literacy. Students from urban schools have only a slightly higher level of digital literacy than their rural counterparts, suggesting that school location may not be a defining explanatory element in the variation of digital literacy and resilience among Vietnamese students. Students' digital literacy and, especially resilience, also have associations with their gender. Moreover, as students are digitally literate, they are more likely to be digitally resilient. Following SDG4, i.e., Quality Education, it is advisable for schools, and especially parents, to seriously invest in creating a safe, educational environment to enhance digital literacy among students. © 2020 by the authors.

The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown. However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features. A full comprehension of the mechanisms driving the evolution of animal CoVs will help better understand the emergence, spreading, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 The Authors Animal coronaviruses; COVID-19; Genetic plasticity; Host switch; Novel human coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Tissue tropism case report; clinical article; comprehension; coronavirus disease 2019; human; nonhuman; review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tropism; animal; Betacoronavirus; classification; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus infection; disease model; genetics; isolation and purification; molecular evolution; pandemic; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Zoonoses COVID-19 and Bangladesh: Challenges and How to Address Them As the coronavirus outbreak quickly surges worldwide, many countries are adopting non-therapeutic preventive measures, which include travel bans, remote office activities, country lockdown, and most importantly, social distancing. However, these measures face challenges in Bangladesh, a lower-middle-income economy with one of the world's densest populations. Social distancing is difficult in many areas of the country, and with the minimal resources the country has, it would be extremely challenging to implement the mitigation measures. Mobile sanitization facilities and temporary quarantine sites and healthcare facilities could help mitigate the impact of the pandemic at a local level. A prompt, supportive, and empathic collaboration between the Government, citizens, and health experts, along with international assistance, can enable the country to minimize the impact of the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Anwar, Nasrullah and Hosen. community mitigation; COVID-19; healthcare; infection prevention and control; non-therapeutic intervention; novel coronavirus; testing  Coronavirus outbreak causes halal sex tourism to suffer The COVID-19 flare-up in Indonesia has been reacted to with detachment by the focal government, which stressed that Indonesia has not experienced numerous instances of contamination, if by any stretch of the imagination. The Indonesia wellbeing priest had likewise created a ruckus with his open proclamation on the COVID-19 when he urged the individuals to depend on 'petition' as a preventive mark as he ticked off the individuals who purchased covers at a more significant expense. Actually, the COVID-19 episode has in truth devastatingly affected Indonesia's economy, particularly the movement and the travel industry segment. The marvel of agreement marriage is a typical wonder that happens in the Southeast Asian area. The act of agreement relationships is as of now predominant in a few Southeast Asian nations, for example, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. In Indonesia, the act of agreement relationships happens in a few locales, for example, West Java, Central Java and East Java and Kalimantan which are completed by remote men from the Middle East. This has become upsides and downsides among Indonesian individuals. Already, Saudi sex searchers hit Thailand during the 80s . In 1989, when relations between the two nations experienced issues brought about by a case called ""blue jewel business"", the Government of Saudi Arabia disallowed its residents from visiting Thailand. Subsequently, visitors from Saudi Arabia and followed by different sightseers from the Gulf nations made a beeline for Indonesia. © 2020 SERSC.

The major limitation to overcome the issue is the lack of potential vaccines or effective medicines to treat or control the disease. Considering the shortness of time to act, the purpose of the paper was to identify and categorise the climatic, socio-biological factors that influence the global super-spread of the epidemic using a theory building approach, ‘Total Interpretive Structural Modelling’ (TISM). MICMAC analysis of the identified factors, based on their interdependence categorized the triggering factors, air temperature, humidity, age, airflow and ventilation, responsible for the increased mortality rate of COVID 19 compared to SARS and MERS. So the model explains why the temperate countries of similar climatic zones and aged people are more vulnerable. It also predicts the susceptibility of countries based on their geographic locations and upcoming climatic conditions which were found to be influential in sustaining longevity and aerosol spread of the virus. Since many of these factors remain unaltered or out of human control, the linkage factors identified in this paper; change in host behaviour and number of contacts can be given priorities in order to overcome the situation. Furthermore, this is the first attempt made to understand epidemiological characteristics of COVID 19 using TISM approach. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat. According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology. The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future. At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19. The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies. In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions. © 2020 by the authors.

So far, 136 reports from the WHO were reported. In the latest report, 6416828 patients in almost all countries have been infected with the COVID-19. The present study discusses the different aspects of COVID such as emergence, signs and symptoms, comparisons with SARS and MERS, concerns, governments' actions in controlling the virus and a descriptive analysis of the spread and death. The emergence of the coronavirus family in the last two decades has created a public health issue around the world. It has also caused serious damages to infrastructure, economy, culture and communities of countries. Thus, affected governments have taken steps to reduce these concerns such as quarantine, education, traffic control, closure of recreational centers, reduction of working hours etc. Despite strict measures to contain the COVID-19, this virus is still expanding and the question of ""what actions should be taken with what political package?"" is being asked. To answer this question, it is important to understand the process of disease occurrence and modeling different interventions on changing the natural course of the disease is very important. © Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Anesthesiology Research Center.

Quantifying the changes of pollutant emissions due to COVID-19 and associated governmental control measures is crucial to understand its impacts on economy, air pollution, and society. We used the WRF-GC model and the tropospheric NO2 column observations retrieved by the TROPOMI instrument to derive the top-down NOx emission change estimation between the three periods: P1 (January 1st to January 22nd, 2020), P2 (January 23rd, Wuhan lockdown, to February 9th, 2020), and P3 (February 10th, back-to-work day, to March 12th, 2020). We found that NOx emissions in East China averaged during P2 decreased by 50% compared to those averaged during P1. The NOx emissions averaged during P3 increased by 26% compared to those during P2. Most provinces in East China gradually regained some of their NOx emissions after February 10, the official back-to-work day, but NOx emissions in most provinces have not yet to return to their previous levels in early January. NOx emissions in Wuhan, the first epicenter of COVID-19, had no sign of emission recovering by March 12. A few provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shanxi, have recovered fast, with their averaged NOx emissions during P3 almost back to pre-lockdown levels. © 2020 by the authors.

Several promising drugs have been identified and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. If efficacy of these drugs is demonstrated, rapid, mass availability at an affordable cost would be essential to ensuring equity and access especially amongst low- and middle-income economies. Methods: Minimum costs of production were estimated from the costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients using established methodology, which had good predictive accuracy for medicines for hepatitis C and HI V amongst others. Data were extracted from global export shipment records or analysis of the route of chemical synthesis. The estimated costs were compared with list prices from a range of countries where pricing data were available. Results: Minimum estimated costs of production were US $0.93/day for remdesivir, $1.45/day for favipiravir, $0.08/day for hydroxychloroquine, $0.02/day for chloroquine, $0.10/day for azithromycin, $0.28/day for lopinavir/ritonavir, $0.39/day for sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and $1.09/day for pirfenidone. Costs of production ranged between $0.30 and $31 per treatment course (10-28 days). Current prices of these drugs were far higher than the costs of production, particularly in the US. Conclusions: Should repurposed drugs demonstrate efficacy against COVID-19, they could be manufactured profitably at very low costs, for much less than current list prices. Estimations for the minimum production costs can strengthen price negotiations and help ensure affordable access to vital treatment for COVID-19 at low prices globally. © 2020 The Authors.

Work from home (WFH) has become the norm, especially for service organizations. Following government instructions, even the academic institutions had to shut down temporarily, affecting academic delivery. Thus, they had to find new alternatives to academic delivery, and virtual classes were the way forward. In the present paper, we attempted to study the impact of lockdown on the teaching – learning process. The objective of the study was to assess the adoption rate for virtual classes and to determine the various benefits, challenges, and reasons for non-adoption of virtual classes. The study considered responses from 341 teachers of higher education institutions (HEIs) of Ghaziabad region. The study was divided into two parts. One set of respondents were those who adopted virtual classrooms and another set that did not adopt virtual classrooms. Descriptive statistics and t-test were performed to analyze the data collected through primary sources. Among those who adopted virtual mode, the mean of actual benefits was significantly less than the mean of expected benefits. Network issues, lack of training, and lack of awareness were stated to be the major challenges faced by them. Lack of awareness was stated to be the most important reason by those who did not adopt virtual classrooms followed by lack of interest and doubts regarding the usefulness of virtual classes. Less attendance, lack of personal touch, and lack of interaction due to connectivity issues were found to be the significant drawbacks of virtual classes. The study also suggested the ways to overcome the above challenges, drawbacks, and reasons behind non-adoption of virtual classes. © 2020, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

The South Korean government has ordered the closure of all schools, as part of its attempts to use social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The effects of the school closures on reducing contagion are generally positive; however, the measure is controversial because of the socioeconomic ripple effect that accompanies it. The author briefly reviewed the existing literature on the mental health aspects of disasters and presents the issues related to school closures due to pandemics, from medical and socioeconomic perspectives and in terms of children’s mental health. The results of this review suggest that research on children’s mental health in relation to the adoption of school closures as a pandemic mitigation strategy is urgently needed. © 2020 Korean Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

It is just required that the interested enterprises send to the Italian National Institute of Health a selfcertification in which they declare the technical characteristics of the masks and that masks are produced according to the safety requirements. In this context, a technical-scientific unit was established at the University of Napoli Federico II to provide interested enterprises with state-of-the-art consultancy, testing and measurement services, adhering to rigorous scientific protocols. Characterization tests were carried out on 163 surgical masks and/or materials for their construction and they have enabled the identification of pre-screening criteria to simplify the procedure for evaluating surgical masks using methods for assessing the filtration efficiency of particles and aerosols. Based on experimental results, it has been observed that a filtration efficiency for particles with sizes larger that 650 nm (PFE>650) exceeding 35% might guarantees a bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE) higher than 95% while BFE values higher than 98% are obtained when the PFE>650 is larger than 40%. PFE measurement is extremely simpler with respect to BFE, the latter being time-consuming and requiring specific equipment and methods for its realization. Many tested materials have shown the capability to assure high filtration efficiencies but Spundonded-Meltblown-Spunbonded (SMS), that are layers of non-woven fabric with different weights of Meltblown, can simultaneously guarantee high particle filtration efficiencies with pressure drop values (breathability) in the limits to classify the surgical masks as Type II/IIR. In fact, the fabric products analyzed so far have not been able to simultaneously guarantee adequate BFE and breathability values. On the contrary, Spunbonds of adequate weights can virtually verify both requirements and accredit themselves as possible materials for the production of surgical masks, at least of Type I. Further studies are needed to verify the possibility of producing low-cost, reusable surgical masks that could meet the criteria of circular economy. © 2020 Tipografia PI-ME Editrice Srl.

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has shown how fragile our global preparedness for infectious diseases is. The world is a small-connected globe with short travel time between its remote parts. COVID-19 has spread globally and swiftly with major impacts on health, economy, and quality of life of communities. At this point in the time, April 9, 2020, >1,500,000 patients have been infected and >88,000 patients have died worldwide within the last 3 months. The status is evolving and the costly lessons learned over time are increasing. These lessons are global as this virus is. They involve different domains of health sciences including virology, public health, clinical, critical care, and disaster management. This review addresses our current knowledge of COVID-19 pandemic from the basic virology and transmission, through prevention, infection control, clinical management, and finally disaster management including the recovery period. This review has a multidisciplinary approach, which is needed at this time. After this difficult period passes, we have to carry the lessons we learned for the future so that we can be better prepared. One thing that has clearly emerged from this ongoing crisis is that infectious diseases have no borders and we have to work together, using the one world, one health approach, if we are to minimize the enormous impact such pandemics can cause. © 2019 Turkish Journal of Emergency Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

This article presents analyses and solutions to the workforce crisis of December 2019 and the workplace crisis of March 2020. Things have escalated from a workforce crisis to a new stage, namely an accelerated loss of workplaces and to a workplace crisis. In a matter of weeks, the labour market has moved from one extreme to the other extremely fast because of a very rough natural phenomenon which could not have been predicted, i.e.The global pandemic crisis caused by the COVID-19 coronavirus. It goes without saying that we all wish to achieve a relative balance on the labour market. This study puts forward concrete solutions adapted to the situation of the Romanian labour market at the end of 2019, when we saw a significant workforce crisis which severely affected companies' business development objectives. At the same time, it introduces 11 solutions to the new job crisis, which is quickly expanding as a result of the global pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus and by the declaration of a state of emergency in Romania. In a few weeks of crisis, Romania went from minus 1 million workers to plus 1 million workers. This is an extremely difficult situation. However, I believe that it is temporary and that after the pandemic crisis both the economy and the labour market will gradually recover. © 2020 Cindrea Ioan, published by Sciendo 2020. alternative solutions; crisis; labour market balance; workforce; workplaces  Consideration of traditional Chinese medicine in treatment of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [中医药治疗人类高致病性冠状病毒SARS-CoV-2与SARS-CoV感染肺炎的思考] Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has broken out in China, similar with the sever acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbroke in 2003, this pestilence has wide epidemic, strong infectivity and high pathogenicity, which led a great impact on the production, life and people's health in China, and brought huge losses to the economy as well. These two kinds of pestilence were caused by human highly pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, respectively. Traditional Chinese medicine, as a unique medical way from China, plays an indelible role in ensuring people’s health. By comparing the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, therapeutic principles and methods of traditional Chinese medicine, this paper puts forward the similarities and differences of traditional Chinese medicine in the prevention, treatment and recovery periods in COVID-19 and SARS, and gives corresponding suggestions. © 2020, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

This has led to a significant impact on the lives and economy in China and other countries. Here we develop a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model with binomial distributions to study the transmission of the disease. Model parameters are estimated on the basis of fitting to newly reported data from January 11 to February 13, 2020 in China. The estimates of the contact rate and the effective reproductive number support the efficiency of the control measures that have been implemented so far. Simulations show the newly confirmed cases will continue to decline and the total confirmed cases will reach the peak around the end of February of 2020 under the current control measures. The impact of the timing of returning to work is also evaluated on the disease transmission given different strength of protection and control measures. © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

However, it has often been invisible in the eyes of policy and policymaking. As soon as the spread of Covid-19 started impacting local and national economies across the globe, many industry and policy bodies rushed into researching the impact of Covid-19 on the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) and the workers in the sector. The paper offers an insight into the key concerns of these organizations through the meta-analysis of the survey and research projects that are currently being undertaken in the context of the UK. The results highlight common concerns in relation to visible and invisible issues that need addressing in the sector. The paper concludes by questioning if Covid-19 represents a moment of crisis for the sector or has simply exposed the unsustainable price of creative and cultural work. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The public health emergency of international concern declares the agent as the (SARS-CoV-2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The COVID-19 pandemic has an unusual way of stroking the entire world. Crises have spread rapidly, disease load and casualties are still on the rise, and crisis influence is spreading across developing countries. Around the globe, the reactions, perceptions, and outcomes were distinct. The outbreak has reflected unfavourable mental health impacts and symptoms. This pandemic has also affected the healthcare department that is treating the patients suffering from diseases other than corona. The power and severity of slowdown varying from being temporary to a long-term recession, they are unanimous about the fact that the slowdown would have an intense impact amongst various sectors of the economy. Most importantly, some panic among consumers and firms has disfigured standard patterns of consumption and caused market inconsistency.

This virus has been found to have striking similarity with the SARS CoV, which caused an epidemic earlier. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnoea, and rarely vomit-ing and diarrhoea. Diagnostic with the help of serological and molecular meth-ods are currently possible, along with CT scans and Chest X Rays for the early detection. Bioinformatics tools are now helping us in mapping the infection dynamics with increased accuracy and are helping us establish a chain of pro-gression of the virus. With research rapidly expanding, new facts have come into the focus and WHO has started a SOLIDARITY program, which helps in randomised drug trials with better validity aided by measures taken by WHO and use of technology.Nevertheless, novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is one of the deadliest viruses’ humanity has encountered, causing not just biological, but also impacting the world economy. This review has all the information about COVID-19 such as its virology, epidemiology, clinical aspects, diagno-sis, possible treatment, and prevention. This study also emphasised on the future direction that could be computational drug screening & vaccine design-ing using Immunoinformatics approach to save time and cost to come out with potential treatments. Drug screening from cell lines and plasma therapy may prove highly effective to treat COVID-19 patients. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences. 2019-nCoV; Bioinformatics; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2  Management of pandemic crisis: COVID-19 The world is threatened with a novel corona virus (COVID-19) which has posed an unpredictable challenge to the public health workforce. It originated from the Wuhan City of China and spread across the globe creating havoc among the public and healthcare workers which led to WHO declaring it to be pandemic. Transmission of this virus is through symptomatic and asymp-tomatic patients in the form of fomites produced while coughing or sneez-ing. This has led to a global crisis subsequently leading to the scarce avail-ability of health care resources such as personal protective equipment, ven-tilators, ICU beds, medication. Healthcare workers have been a vital human resource in providing treatment and assistance to the infected patients though they were facing a high risk of themselves getting infected by the coronavirus. They suffered from fatigue, physical, and psychological violence as they tend to work for longer hours. Detection of infected patients was implemented, as the widely used RT-PCR method was accurate but took more time for the definite results. Hence, for quick results and to detect more number of infected patients, the rapid antigen test was conducted. Therefore, this virus has resulted in a greater impact on the economy and social development and this article of many infected countries. © 2020, J. K. Welfare and Pharmascope Foundation.

COVID-19; Crisis; Health Care Workers; Pandemic  A biography of coronaviruses from ibv to SARS-CoV-2, with their evolutionary paradigms and pharmacological challenges Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family (Coronaviridae) of viruses that cause respiratory disorders in birds and mammals. They were originally discovered as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) of chickens in the early 20th century. A group of related viruses subsequently discovered from mice and humans led to the collective naming as coronaviruses, as they were all characterized by a solar corona-like ring on their surface, called the spikes. The first known human CoVs were among viruses that cause common cold and considered as modest threats to human health. But the emergence of zoonotic CoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) during every recent past decade resulted in pandemics with loss of human lives. With no vaccine to prevent, and no drug to treat the infections, the miniscule viruses evolve into behemoths of plagues. SARS-CoV-2 with its infection, COVID-19, is particularly rampant and malicious and is bound to cause colossal impacts not only on human health but also on global economy. Understanding of their evolutionary strategies and pathogenic adaptions had given us fair warnings. Yet, the world was ill-prepared.

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen. © 2020, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

The different pandemics that humanity has experienced, such as the Spanish Flu, Asian Flu, Hong Kong Flu, HIV/AIDS, SARS, Ebola, and Swine Flu, have had a great impact on the economy, the environment and any human activity, such as livestock, agriculture, tourism, transport, education, health, fishing, mining, industry, commerce, etc. Currently, humanity is facing another pandemic, the infection of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that generates the disease known as COVID-19. The objective of this document is to analyze and discuss the effects in agriculture of events related to the disease of COVID- 19. For this analysis, data from the Food Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO) and scientific and technical documents have been used. There is sufficient evidence to affirm that the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 disease has an important effect on agriculture and the food supply chain, mainly affecting food demand and consequently food security, with a great impact on the most vulnerable population. © 2020 All rights reserved. 2019-nCoV; Agriculture; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Food security; Food supply chain  Assessment of the implementation of preventive measures by iraqis people to reduce the spread of COVID-19 pandemic [Valoración de la implementación de medidas preventivas por parte del pueblo iraquí para reducir la propagación de la pandemia de COVID-19] Background and aim the new outbreak “Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” happened in china is caused by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavi-rus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Consequently, it spreads across the globe and is affecting wellbe-ing frameworks and the global economy. This pandemic disease places a heavy burden on governments in general, so individuals must adhere to WHO's instructions to limit its spread. The current study was applied to find out the extent of commitment among the Iraqi people to the standards of prevention measures against the coronavirus. Materials and Methods A cross sec¬tional study was conducted with 1153 respondents widely in all governorates of Iraq to identify the commitment of the Iraqis to the preventive measures against COVID-19 in Iraq. This study covered the Iraqis in three main regions (Southern, middle, and Northern) for data collection. It was conducted between the 17th and 25th of March 2020, and Iraqis were administered with a structu-red questionnaire comprising of three domains. Results The results showed that the majority of the respondents (52%) were female, and most of them (42.3%) were observed between the age group of 31-40 years. About 82% of the respondents were residents of urban areas. Conclusion This study reveals the excellent implementation of preventive measures by the population. It is observed that the application of prevention standards in the countryside is less than in the city. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia. All rights reserved.

While research has paid considerable attention to the technical, epidemiological and public health aspects of the pandemic in Africa, it neglects the social, economic and political dimensions. Relying on analysis of data on trends of COVID-19 infections from the World Health Organization and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and a rapid review of available international and national policy/programme documents on COVID-19 control responses in Africa, this study assessed the extant protocols and responses to COVID-19 in relation to urban governance principles. Utilizing the political economy framework, the social conditions of informal labour and business activities during the COVID-19 pandemic are explored with accession to social habitus of informality. The paper argues that in as much as the COVID-19 pandemic is a pervasive health problem it should be treated more as a social and political economy challenge given the large informal nature of urbanism in Africa. The study concludes that urban governance that incorporates collective organization, community groups, non-state and informal actors offers scope in the battle against COVID-19 in Africa. Rethinking African urbanism in line with the principles of the Global Campaign on Urban Governance is also canvassed. © The Author(s) 2020.

COVID-19 was first reported in Indonesia on March 03, 2020 then rapidly spread to all 34 provinces by April 09, 2020. Since then, COVID-19 is declared a state of national disaster and health emergency. This research analyzes the difference of CO, HCHO, NO2, and SO2 density in Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, and South Sulawesi before and during the pandemic. Also, this study assesses the effect of large scale restrictions on the economic growth during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. In a nutshell, the results on Wilcoxon and Fisher test by significance level α=5% as well as odds ratio showed that there are significant differences of CO density in all regions with highest odds ratio in East Java (OR=9.07), significant differences of HCHO density in DKI Jakarta, East Java, and South Sulawesi. There are significant differences of NO2 density before and during public activities limitation in DKI Jakarta, West Java, East Java, and South Sulawesi. However, the results show that there are no significant differences of SO2 density in all regions. In addition, this research shows that there are significant differences of retail, grocery and pharmacy, and residental mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. This research also shows that during the COVID-19 pandemic there are severe economic losses, industry, companies, and real disruptions are severe for all levels of life due to large scale restrictions. © 2020 GJESM.

Designing appropriate interventions and identifying the concerns of those most at risk requires methods that can extract worries, concerns and emotional responses from text data. We examine gender differences and the effect of document length on worries about the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Our findings suggest that i) short texts do not offer as adequate insights into psychological processes as longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics concerning emotional responses. Women worried more about their loved ones and severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy and society. This paper adds to the understanding of general gender differences in language found elsewhere, and shows that the current unique circumstances likely amplified these effects. We close this paper with a call for more high-quality datasets due to the limitations of Tweet-sized data. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Today, the Covid-19 is a global issue, and the world economy can be interpreted as almost at the standstill. In this context, this study aims to discuss the potential first reactions of short and long term global economic impacts of the pandemic through sectors by assessing its costs according to the data announced for both the world and Turkey. In addition, this study tries to put forth possible economic and political scenarios for the post-pandemic world. Materials and methods: This is a review article that summarizes the current reports and discussions about the economic consequences of this historical event, and tries to make some inferences considering them. Results: This pandemic has severe adverse effects on the employees, customers, supply chains and financial markets, in brief, most probably it will cause a global economic recession. Nevertheless, due to the uncertainty of the end of this pandemic, both the length and scale of this contraction are not predictable. Conclusion: It takes a while for the world economy to recover from the contraction. It seems that this pandemic will lead to a permanent shift in the world and its politics, especially in health, security, trade, employment, agriculture, manufacturing goods production and science policies. Since this new world might provide great opportunities for some countries that did not dominate world production before, governments should develop new strategies to adjust the new world order without much delay. © TÜBİTAK.

This uncertainty has therefore negatively influenced the business perspective and the various formulated strategies that may not considered such [extreme] circumstances. Using baseline analysis and archival data, this paper reports some of the major implications of COVID-19 on global business and strategy and puts forward suggested research agenda as potential future directions for organizations. In order to survive and remain sustainable, this paper argues that businesses need to revisit their strategies during current COVID-19 crises from three perspectives, including supporting human resources financial commitment, forming crossfunctional teams and connecting with their supply chains, as well as investing in corporate social responsibility and doubling down efforts with regard to partnerships. The study also represents a preliminary analysis to the implications of COVID-19 on the business and strategies across the globe and is considered the first such in the field of business, as to date all research papers on COVID-19 have been published in medical-related journals. Directions for future research are also proposed at the end of this study. © Copyright: The Author(s).

Advances in medical science have failed in containing the onslaught of the virus. The world economy is on a downward spiral caused by the lockdowns imposed all over the globe both by developed and developing countries. International and domestic supply chains have been disrupted and almost all sectors of the economy have been reeling under the devastating effects of this crisis. This research study, based on secondary data, mainly focuses on four key areas of economy like Travel and Tourism, Crude oil, Food Security and Global job loss It highlights the various dimensions of the impact which the coronavirus has had on the world economy. It also discusses the various measures to be taken to overcome the adverse effects of the crisis caused by the pandemic. The findings of the study suggest that only collaborative planning and strategizing involving global leaders would result in creative solutions and meaningful interventions for helping the world economy to rebound and recover. © 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

A collapse in oil prices, triggered by the pandemic, once again exposed Russia’s enduring susceptibility to sharp falls in oil and gas prices. We argue that this decline in oil prices came at a time when tectonic shifts in global energy markets had already threatened to reduce the value of future oil and gas revenues. These structural changes were accelerated by the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic. Because the Russian leadership had done little to address the threat posed by the emergence of a new energy order, the economy remained highly dependent on oil and gas sales as the primary source of growth. While measures undertaken since 2014 to reduce the government’s fiscal dependence on high oil prices will help Russia avoid a worst-case outcome of a fiscal or financial crisis, the dependence of other branches of the economy on the energy sector remains high. This has left Russia set once again to experience a deeper recession than that forecast for other energy exporting economies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. budget; COVID-19; oil; prospects; Russia; support  Social economy and covid-19: Contributions and perspectives in colombia [Economía social y covid-19: Aportes y perspectivas en colombia] The purpose of this article is to present the contributions of the social economy and its relevance in Colombia in times of pandemic. It is a documentary-type investigative work, with a descriptive and purposeful approach, structured in three sections: 1) impact of Covid-19 on employment, informality and poverty; 2) contributions from the social economy before Covid 19; 3) relevance of the social economy in times of pandemic. The article concludes that the social economy is a model that provides social benefits, contributes significantly to the satisfaction of needs in times of crisis and can become a fundamental element for solving Colombia's structural problems, evidenced by the pandemic, which must be resolved through the construction of a new social pact. © 2020, Universidad del Zulia.

A data-driven approach to model and forecast The pandemic shock puts the world on quarantine and paused economic operations that affected energy consumption and economic output. This study analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 shock on GDP, energy consumption, and climate change then forecasted the situation until 2032 using the system dynamic modeling approach. The outcomes reveal that the pandemic shock will decrease the growth by 1.3% in 2020 and 1.32% in 2021. The current shortfall, low energy consumption, and delay in completion of energy-related projects can reduce the GDP by 5.2% in 2020. The effect will penetrate the system and will cause further losses in the upcoming years. The energy consumption and quarantine situation will improve the climate situation and drop the average temperature by 0.049 and 0.021 oC in 2020 and 2021. The aggregate demand and supply side measures such as national spending, lowering the lending rate, and cuts in income taxes can help in diffusing the situation. The government should start operations on ongoing energy projects, give relaxation to SME’s with tight SOPs to secure jobs, and prevent possible GDP losses. The decline in oil prices provides an opportunity to cut fossil fuel subsidies and implement a carbon pricing mechanism. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, earlier witnessed by the citizens of China alone, has now become a matter of grave concern for virtually every country in the world. The scarcity of resources to endure the COVID-19 outbreak combined with the fear of overburdened healthcare systems has forced a majority of these countries into a state of partial or complete lockdown. The number of laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases has been increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world, with reportedly more than 3 million confirmed cases as of 30 April 2020. Adding to these woes, numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. In response to such acts, we draw on various reliable sources to present a detailed review of all the major aspects associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct health implications associated with the outbreak of COVID-19, this study highlights its impact on the global economy. In drawing things to a close, we explore the use of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and 5G, among others, to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreak. © 2013 IEEE. 5G; AI; Blockchain; Coronavirus; COVID-19; global economic impact; IoMT applications; IoT; pandemic; transmission stages; UAVs for disaster management 5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Blockchain; Drones; Coronaviruses; Global economies; Health implications; Health-care system; Internet of thing (IOT); World Health Organization; Internet of things Environmental pollution and COVID-19 outbreak: insights from Germany The impact of environmental pollutants and climate indicators on the outbreak of COVID-19 has gained considerable attention in the recent literature. However, specific investigation of industrial economies like Germany is not available. This provides us motivation to examine the association between environmental pollutants, climate indicators and the COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths in Germany using daily data from February 24, 2020, to July 02, 2020. The correlation analysis and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) approach are the analytical tools, which are used to explore the association between variables included in the study. Our findings indicate that PM2.5, O3, and NO2 have a significant relationship with the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, temperature is the only significant climate indicator which has significant correlation with the spread of COVID-19. Finally, PM10, humidity, and environmental quality index have a significant relationship only with the active cases from COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings conclude that Germany’s successful response to COVID-19 is attributed to environmental legislation and the medical care system, which oversaw significant overhaul after the SARS and MERS outbreaks. The current study implicates that other industrial economies, especially European economies, that are still facing COVID-19 outbreak can follow the German model for pandemic response. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

A report of three cases Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a 2020 pandemic, has resulted in an unexpected loss in lives, quality of life, and the economy. The COVID-19 clinical spectrum varies from asymptomatic to death, and its complications may involve various organs. Notwithstanding, the impact of COVID-19 on endocrine systems is understudied. Previous coronavirus outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus can cause new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM). However, there were only two previous case reports on newly diagnosed DM in COVID-19 patients. Here, we described three patients who had newly diagnosed DM associated with COVID-19. COVID-19 likely unmasked existing DM by aggravating its metabolic complications rather than causing the new-onset DM in these patients. However, more research is needed to evaluate if there is a casual relationship between the development of DM, DKA, and COVID-19. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC COVID-19; DKA; DM; SARS-CoV-2  Feeling Positive about Reopening? New Normal Scenarios from COVID-19 US Reopen Sentiment Analytics The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse circumstances. This research identifies public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential public sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges. This research focuses on emotional consequences-the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to the COVID-19 reopening debate, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to reopen the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios-an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of textual data analytics, including textual data visualization and statistical validation, that tweets data from American Twitter users shows more positive sentiment support, than negative, for reopening the US economy. This research develops a novel sentiment polarity based public sentiment scenarios (PSS) framework, which will remain useful for future crises analysis, well beyond COVID-19. With additional validation, this research stream could present valuable time sensitive opportunities for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide local and regional communities, and the nation into a successful new normal future. © 2013 IEEE. coronavirus; COVID-19; feeling; new normal; reopen; sentiment analysis; textual analytics; Twitter Data Analytics; Economics; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Coronaviruses; Federal governments; Public sentiments; Research focus; Socio-economic consequences; State governments; Statistical validation; US economy; Data visualization COVID-19: Progress in diagnostics, therapy and vaccination Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently become a pandemic. As the sudden emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is endangering global health and the economy, the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. At present, various diagnostic kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 are available for use to initiate appropriate treatment faster and to limit further spread of the virus. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 or potential clinical benefits. In addition, institutions and companies worldwide are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines against COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine has yet been specifically approved for COVID-19. Given the urgency of the outbreak, we focus here on recent advances in the diagnostics, treatment, and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to guide strategies to address the current COVID-19 pandemic. © The author(s).

Such public safety infectious disease includes influences great pressure on the national economy. At present, some countries and regions in the world are still in epidemic situation, and there is an urgent need to judge the infection situation and travel risk in the region. In a relatively fine scale down to perceive the surrounding situation, and then rational zoning decisions to promote the resumption of production and work. In this study, indicators for the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic were constructed using multi-sourced data. A computational evaluation of 736 fine-grained grids was performed using the GeoDetector model and the decision tree model. The study found that the risk level in older neighborhoods was much higher than in newer neighborhoods; the population density was the most important determinant of infection; the number of urban people slumped to 37% of that in usual times according to Tencent data after the 'city closure'; The model this paper used portrays the major factor in defining low-risk areas and high-risk areas, and offers suggestions and assessment from a geographical perspective to fight COVID-19, thus presenting great practical value. © 2013 IEEE.

The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of bromhexine in intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Methods: An open-label randomized clinical trial study was performed in Tabriz, NorthWest of Iran. They were randomized to either the treatment with the bromhexine group or the control group, in a 1:1 ratio with 39 patients in each arm. Standard therapy was used in both groups and those patients in the treatment group received oral bromhexine 8 mg three times a day additionally. The primary outcome was a decrease in the rate of ICU admissions, intubation/ mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Results: A total of 78 patients with similar demographic and disease characteristics were enrolled. There was a significant reduction in ICU admissions (2 out of 39 vs. 11 out of 39, P= 0.006), intubation (1 out of 39 vs. 9 out of 39, P= 0.007) and death (0 vs. 5, P= 0.027) in the bromhexine treated group compared to the standard group. No patients were withdrawn from the study because of adverse effects. Conclusion: The early administration of oral bromhexine reduces the ICU transfer, intubation, and the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. This affordable medication can easily be administered everywhere with a huge positive impact(s) on public health and the world economy. Altogether, the verification of our results on a larger scale and different medical centers is strongly recommended. © 2020 The Author(s).

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial task, as it reduces the risk of pandemic spread, and early treatment will save patients' life. Due to the time-consuming, complex nature, and high false-negative rate of the gold-standard RT-PCR test used for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the need for an additional diagnosis method has increased. Studies have proved the significance of X-ray images for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The dissemination of deep-learning techniques on X-ray images can automate the diagnosis process and serve as an assistive tool for radiologists. In this study, we used four deep-learning models-DenseNet121, ResNet50, VGG16, and VGG19-using the transfer-learning concept for the diagnosis of X-ray images as COVID-19 or normal. In the proposed study, VGG16 and VGG19 outperformed the other two deep-learning models. The study achieved an overall classification accuracy of 99.3%. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the leading strategy to curtail the spread of the dis-eases has been various control measures which aim at breaking the chain of COVID-19 spread. In this work, we investigate the impact of government control measures and immune system strength on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Discrete delays are used to describe the restriction in social contacts due to government orders and the delay in infection manifestation due to immune response. The qualitative analysis of COVID-19 pandemic steady-state predict a stable state if COVID-19 latent period is negative and unstable state when the latent period is positive. The inclusion of delay in social contacts stabilizes the unstable pandemic steady-state when the infection is symptomatic and unstable when the infection is asymptomatic. Optimal strategy to flatten COVID-19 pandemic curve using social distance is also recommended. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.. All rights reserved.

As on date, around 8.20 million confirmed cases including death of around 443,815 have been reported. The present review deals with the history and origin of the COVID-19, its worldwide pandemic spread, symptoms and preventive measures as an attempt to create awareness of the fatal disease. © 2020 Deuton-X Ltd.

The COVID-19 outbreak occurred suddenly, and many countries were ill prepared to face it. Community behaviour has been altered due to the pandemic. Uncertainty surrounding the disease triggered panic buying; public panic caused additional worry about limited food supplies, and thus demand increased. World economies have also felt the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Owing to the measures put in place to address the spread of COVID-19, many service providers and industries were closed, resulting in financial losses, and the risk of unemployment was elevated, which inevitably increased negative emotions in individuals. A psychosocial consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is worldwide fear. Because psychological defence is a supporting factor for the recovery of COVID-19 patients, it is important to encourage prevention of mental stress. Psychotherapy is able to provide counselling services to the community through teleconsultation. Strengthening psychological defences can help countries fight against this disease. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

We considered two scenarios. The first scenario has two channels of transmission over the economic system: a negative shock of labour supply due to the rates of morbidity and mortality caused by the pandemic, and a temporary shutdown of nonessential economic activities. The second scenario adds to the first the effects of the government fiscal package adopted to counteract the effects of COVID-19 on the economy. Furthermore, in both scenarios, a sensitive analysis related to the temporality of the shutdown is considered by assuming 3 and 6 months of shutdown. The results indicate a reduction of 3.78% in the national GDP growth rate in Scenario 1 and a reduction of 0.48% in Scenario 2, in 2020, with 3 months of shutdown. With 6 months, the reduction would be greater, 10.90% and 7.64% in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the government fiscal stimulus considered in this study partially mitigates the reduction in GDP projected under the COVID-19 outbreak. The study also presents sectoral projections at the national and state levels. The estimates indicate reductions in the GDP of most of Brazilian states in both scenarios. © 2020 The Author(s).

In a previous paper, it was noted that a country's failure to dampen a first wave of infection or the recurrence of a second wave would serve as disincentives for greatly needed tourists in summer 2020 and would further significantly reduce tourism revenues and potentially accelerate job losses and bankruptcies in affected countries. Countries in the first wave of infection would need to restrain COVID-19 spread swiftly in order to benefit from summer 2020 tourism. Countries that had controlled COVID-19 and who experienced second waves would manifest the same negative effects. In the case of Malta, up to the beginning of July, the country had the lowest COVID-19 numbers in Europe but this ended abruptly when two mass events took place. In a fortnight, the steep escalation of cases led to a downgrade of the country's status to a high-risk destination, with a host of European countries enacting quarantine measures. The Maltese government re-imposed restrictions and COVID-19 numbers slowly started to temporarily decline. As an economy, Malta is highly dependent on the tourism industry, with approximately 17% of GDP reliant on this sector, directly and indirectly. Malta's red listing wrought a heavy toll on the industry. The World Health Organisation has mandated clear criteria for the release of restrictions and this sequence of events should serve as a cautionary tale: heed the advice of our public health colleagues. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. COVID-19; Economics; Internet; Recession; Tourism  COVID-19: Combined supply-side and demand-side shocks, so lift restrictions (carefully) lest GPD declines ultimately kill more than COVID-19 COVID-19 remains pandemic. Social distancing and travel restrictions have avoided countless deaths and infections but disrupted livelihoods and economies. The global loss of gross (world) product is unprecedented as COVID-19 has inflicted both a supply-side and a demand-side shock. While public health measures have mitigated morbidity and mortality, the excessive loss of GDP will lead to years of life lost due to recession with diminished spend on healthcare, safety and the environment. This paper will review the estimated COVID-19 economic impact and show that it is timely and crucial to (carefully) ease restrictions as any additional economic slide will continue to intensify an already parlous situation and further negatively impact overall global average human life expectancy. The USA and UK will be used as specific examples, as will the general case of delayed cancer treatment due to COVID-19 service disruption. Financial stimuli that attempt to revive flagging economies by governments and blocs will be outlined and the current uniformly bleak global forecasts will be briefly contrasted with the Great Depression of the 1930s. The biased adverse impact on low-income households will be sketched, and a reminder of the unknown eventual costs of lasting illness (“long COVID”) will also have to be factored in restriction removal policies. At this point in time (end of summer 2020), fierce debates rage within each country regarding the potential trade-offs of health vs economy. The need for unbiased and rigorous quantitative evaluations of all possible decisions is paramount. © 2020 COVID-19; Depression; Economics; Health economics; Recession  Lifting lockdown policies: A critical moment for COVID-19 stigma COVID-19 ‘lockdown’ policies may have unintended consequences for individuals, households and country economies. Hence lockdown may be unsustainable despite the risk of a resurgence of new COVID-19 infections. The repeal and alteration of lockdown policies mark a symbolic transfer of responsibility for epidemic control from state to individual. This has the potential to catalyse fear, blame and judgement within and between populations. We draw on experience from the HIV pandemic to show that this will worsen during later phases of the pandemic if COVID-19 stigma increases, as we fear it could. We suggest policy recommendations for ‘lockdown lifting’ to limit COVID-19 stigma. We suggest three policy priorities to minimise potential increases in COVID-19 stigma: limit fear by strengthening risk communication, engage communities to reduce the emergence of blaming, and emphasise social justice to reduce judgement. ‘Lockdown’ policies cannot continue uninterrupted. However, lifting lockdown without unintended consequences may prove harder than establishing it. This period has the potential to see the emergence of fear, blame and judgement, intersecting with existing inequalities, as governments seek to share responsibility for preventing further Sars-Cov-2 transmission. As we have learned from HIV, it is critical that a wave of COVID-19 stigma is prevented from flourishing. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. community; COVID-19; human rights; public health; stigma  Analytical Methods on Determination in Pharmaceuticals and Biological Materials of Chloroquine as Available for the Treatment of COVID-19 With the outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (COVID-19), people’s health and existing economies on a global scale are seriously threatened. Currently, most of the countries all over the world are studying extensively to better understand the antimalarial chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for therapeutic purposes due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, CQ and HCQ can have serious side effects, from psychiatric effects to sudden death. Therefore, a faster and more effective detection method is needed to monitor drug concentrations. In this review, a large study was conducted on the detection techniques and quantitative determination methods of CQ and its related metabolites. In this review, chromatography, electrophoresis, electroanalytical, spectroscopic, and immunological methods for CQ and related metabolites are discussed extensively. It is hoped that a better understanding of the CQ used for therapeutic purposes in the COVID-19 outbreak will be provided. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The adoption of a preventive measure is required to control the spread. This research explores the impact of influencing factors like COVID-19 knowledge, behavioral control, moral and subject norms, preventive e-guidelines by the government, and environmental factors on the intention to prevent COVID-19 and risk aversion. A cross-sectional study was performed of 310 respondents about different COVID-19 related influencing factors in Pakistan. The partial least square-structural equation modeling was applied to estimate the path coefficient. Moral and subject norms (0.359) had a comparatively higher path coefficient. Other influencing factors/drivers were preventive e-guideline by the government (0.215) followed by COVID-19 knowledge (0.197), and behavioral control (0.121). The intention to prevent COVID-19 showed a positive and significant impact (0.705) on risk aversion. The indirect analysis also confirmed that the positive influence of moral and subject norms, COVID-19 knowledge, preventive e-guideline by the government, and behavioral control on risk aversion. However, the path coefficient of environmental factors was negative but insignificant, which implies than environmental factors do not influence the intention to prevent COVID-19. It is suggested to provide clear guidelines using print, social, electronic media. It is also suggested to provide e-guidelines in local languages. The COVID-19 knowledge about its transmission, symptoms, and precautions is also useful. It is suggested to include the causes, symptoms, and precaution of viral diseases in the educational syllabus. The government should ensure the availability of preventive medical items like surgical masks and sanitizers to meet the demand of the public. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

The tendency to confront these pandemics is still questionable. In January 2020, the first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in India was identified in Kerala. Later, the Indian government announced lockdown as a remedial action against COVID-19. The present work aims to elucidate the community behavioural response towards COVID-19 lockdown in India and presents comprehensive observations. Protection motivational theory has been used to build a conceptual framework. It was observed that community behavioural response includes maladaptive, adaptive and prosocial behaviours. In addition, we conclude that the effective strategy against the prevention, spread and control of pandemics and strategic management is still lacking. Hence, we propose a framework based on the learnings from COVID-19 to tackle future pandemics. © The Author(s) 2020.

The latter includes the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in clinical practice and research. We report a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on the use of clinical EEG in practice and research in several countries, and the recommendations of an international panel of experts for the safe application of EEG during and after this pandemic. Methods: Fifteen clinicians from 8 different countries and 25 researchers from 13 different countries reported the impact of COVID-19 on their EEG activities, the procedures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and precautions planned or already implemented during the reopening of EEG activities. Results: Of the 15 clinical centers responding, 11 reported a total stoppage of all EEG activities, while 4 reduced the number of tests per day. In research settings, all 25 laboratories reported a complete stoppage of activity, with 7 laboratories reopening to some extent since initial closure. In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings. The continued use of EEG is important in those with psychiatric diseases, particularly in times of social alarm such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2020.

Neither the virus nor the disease that it causes is truly novel, as the virus is part of the SARS virus family and therefore known, and likewise the symptoms of the disease (Covid-19) are also well known, even flu-like, and therefore also not novel. Yet, what is truly novel about the virus or the disease it causes is its effect, not specifically referring to the health effect, but its global socio-economic and political effect. It is for the first time in the history of humanity that such drastic global lockdown measures have been taken and that governments have taken the conscious decisions to ‘lay lame’ (cripple) their economies. Such a radical decision is truly novel. Besides the economic ‘lockdown’, there are numerous socio-economic repercussions; for example, in a single day, millions (3.3. million) of citizens in the United States file for unemployment, and similarly in many other countries. Covid-19 is a challenge to the economies of the world, to society at large, to the poor and vulnerable in particular, and to individuals who are ‘locked safely’ in their homes. Religious institutions, which traditionally provide collective meaning, can no longer gather in public places, and offer communal solace. Covid-19 maybe challenges what being human means, or at least, what one has come to believe concerning the meaning of being human. In this article, this question of being human in the time of Covid-19 will be explored. © 2020. The Authors.

Methods: Epidemiological, business and economic data were extracted from official government sources covering the period 31st January to 13th August 2020; healthcare system data up to end of June 2019. Results: UK-wide COVID-19 cases and deaths were 313,798 and 46,706 respectively (472 cases and 70 deaths per 100,000 population) by 12th August. There were regional variations in England, with London and North West (756 and 666 cases per 100,000 population respectively) disproportionately affected compared with other regions. As of 11th August, 13,618,470 tests had been conducted in the UK. Increased risk of mortality was associated with age (≥60 years), gender (male) and BAME groups. Since onset of the pandemic, emergency department attendance, primary care utilisation and cancer referrals and inpatient/outpatient referrals have declined; emergency ambulance and NHS111 calls increased. Business sectors most impacted are the arts, entertainment and recreation, followed by accommodation and food services. Government interventions aimed at curtailing the business and economic impact have been implemented, but applications for state benefits have increased. Conclusions: The impact of COVID-19 on the UK population, health system and economy has been profound. More data are needed to implement the optimal policy and technological responses to preventing further spikes in COVID-19 cases, and to inform strategic planning to manage future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Economic impact; Epidemiology; Health system impact; Technological response; United Kingdom  Indonesian rupiah exchange rate in facing COVID-19 (A time series-machine learning approach) Nowadays, the world is currently facing COVID-19 health issues. In addition to the risk of health problems, this pandemic has also disrupted the global economy. The exchange rate of Rupiah also devalued during the COVID 19 outbreak. The interventions from the government to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have impacted the Rupiah exchange rate too. This study tries to use the most appropriate forecasting method to predict further values of the Rupiah exchange rate. The aim of this research is to look for the most useful method of predicting the Rupiah exchange rate, which can be used to capture various data patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The methods that will be involved in this research are Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), NNAR (Neural Network Auto-Regressive), Extreme Learning Machine, and Support Vector Machine. The result is that the LSTM model is the best prediction method for predicting an exchange rate from Rupiah that can allow long-term dependency. This model shows that although there were no COVID-19 events based on the model formed, it was predicted that the rupiah would decline in value against the US dollar. The COVID-19 case made the depreciation of the rupiah currency far greater than predicted. The declining growth of Covid-19 cases in Indonesia, accompanied by the Indonesian government's policy on large-scale social restrictions (Bahasa: PSBB), appears to have managed to increase the value of the rupiah against the US dollar. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

The disease prevention is best practiced by informing about the illness, the symptoms experienced by individual, the virus and its route of transmission. The best way to prevent COVID-19 disease is by hand washing or using an alcohol-based preparation for hand rubbing and avoiding touching the face, particularly the nose. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat that has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality world wide. It also impacted the economy and social integrity. There is growing concern about the general population's mental health challenges, patients infected with COVID-19, close contacts, the elderly, children and health professionals. The article aims at increasing consciousness and emphasizing on various mental health issues experienced by various individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 by Advance Scientific Research. COVID-19; Health challenges; Health professionals  Pandemics, tourism and global change: a rapid assessment of COVID-19 The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is challenging the world. With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the main strategy to contain the pandemic. Unprecedented global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders are causing the most severe disruption of the global economy since World War II. With international travel bans affecting over 90% of the world population and wide-spread restrictions on public gatherings and community mobility, tourism largely ceased in March 2020. Early evidence on impacts on air travel, cruises, and accommodations have been devastating. While highly uncertain, early projections from UNWTO for 2020 suggest international arrivals could decline by 20 to 30% relative to 2019. Tourism is especially susceptible to measures to counteract pandemics because of restricted mobility and social distancing. The paper compares the impacts of COVID-19 to previous epidemic/pandemics and other types of global crises and explores how the pandemic may change society, the economy, and tourism. It discusses why COVID-19 is an analogue to the ongoing climate crisis, and why there is a need to question the volume growth tourism model advocated by UNWTO, ICAO, CLIA, WTTC and other tourism organizations. © 2020 The Author(s).

Mitigation efforts created an imbalance between population health, capacity of the healthcare system and economic prosperity. Each pandemic arising from a new virus is unknown territory for policy makers, and there is considerable uncertainty of the appropriateness of responses and outcomes. Methods: A qualitative approach was used to review mixed sources of data including Australian reports, official government publications, and COVID-19 data to discern robust future responses. Publicly available epidemiological and economic data were utilised to provide insight into the impact of the pandemic on Australia's healthcare system and economy. Results: Policies implemented by the Australian Government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 impacted the healthcare sector and economy. This paper incorporates lessons learned to inform optimal economic preparedness. The rationale for an economic response plan concomitant with the health pandemic plan is explored to guide Australian Government policy makers in ensuring holistic and robust solutions for future pandemics. Conclusions: In future, an Australian Economic Pandemic Response Plan will aid in health and economic system preparedness, whilst a strong Australian economy and strategic planning will ensure resilience to future pandemics. © 2020 Australia; COVID-19; Economic impact; Health policy; Healthcare outcomes; Pandemic planning; Policy interventions  The molecular footprints of COVID-19 COVID-19 is the third spread of animal coronavirus over the past two decades, resulting in a major epidemic in humans after SARS and MERS. COVID-19 is responsible of the biggest biological earthquake in the world. In the global fight against COVID-19 some serious mistakes have been done like, the countries’ misguided attempts to protect their economies, lack of international co-operation. These mistakes that the people had done in previous deadly outbreaks. The result has been a greater economic devastation and the collapse of national and international trust for all. In this constantly changing environment, if we have a better understanding of the host-virus interactions than we can be more prepared to the future deadly outbreaks. When encountered with a disease which the causative is unknown, the reaction time and the precautions that should be taken matters a great deal. In this review we aimed to reveal the molecular footprints of COVID-19 scientifically and to get an understanding of the pandemia. This review might be a highlight to the possible outbreaks. © 2020 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.

This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH COVID-19; MERS; SARS; spike protein; vaccine candidate; vaccine development  The urban penalty of COVID-19 lockdowns across the globe: manifestations and lessons for Anglophone sub-Saharan Africa The paper contributes towards deciphering and decoding the misery of the urban poor in light of the COVID-19 scourge. The paper unpacks urban poverty in light of the corona virus. The emergence of the COVID-19 and the lack of any vaccines requires physical distancing as preventative measures to contain and reduce the spread of the virus. Governments across the world, including in Anglophone Sub Saharan Africa have implemented lockdown measures. The COVID-19 pandemic is happening within settlements where the majority of the population lives from hand to mouth. In Anglophone sub-Saharan Africa because of urbanisation and increased urban poverty, COVID-19 scourge has had a huge impact on the urban poor. The COVID-19 is likely to devastate economies and the community. For rapidly growing, densely populated and poorly planned settlements, the situation is tragic for these inhabitants. Nation states lockdown and social and physical distancing in response to the pandemic have escalated their misery. The paper adopts a critical review of literature anchored in case study analysis, document analysis and scanning from reports. Results point to redefining the way humanity has related, functioned and conceptualised realities. There is need to go beyond prevention from infection as majority of urban dwellers are in the informal sector or unemployed. For the urban poor, strategies for social distancing may not be possible or effective. People are being asked to make choices between being hungry and risk of getting infected. The paper recommends planning response at national, regional and local level bearing in mind informal settlements, high densities and forms of overcrowding which have been placed as hotspots for the virus. There is need for rebuilding societies, during and beyond COVID-19 calling for immediate disaster risk planning adaptation and transformation to promote resilience. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research. Additionally, all the models and data used in this study are open source and freely available, thereby, reproducibility and scientific replication will be achievable easily. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on 56 global stock indices from October 15, 2019 to August 7, 2020 by using a complex network method. Furthermore, the change of the network structure is analyzed in depth by dividing the stock markets into developed, emerging and frontier markets. The findings reveal a structural change in the form of node changes, reduced connectivity and significant differences in the topological characteristics of the network, due to COVID-19. A contagion effect is also identified in the network structure of emerging markets, with the nodes behaving synchronously. The findings also reveal substantial clustering and homogeneity in the world stock market network, based on geographic positioning. Besides, the number of positive correlations in the global stock indices increased during the outbreak. The stock markets of France and Germany seem to be the most relevant developed markets, while Taiwan and Slovenia have this relevance in emerging and frontier markets. The findings of this study help regulators and practitioners to design important strategies in the light of varying stock market dynamics during COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Minimum spanning tree; Network; Network topology; Stock markets  Analysis of COVID-19 Pandemic Using Artificial Intelligence The emerging issue of COVID-19, which is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a significant problematic issue. This disease has impacted worldwide and covered the globe in its threat. Scientists and physicians have been investigating pathophysiological aspects of this pandemic to understand the virus structure for the treatment development. In this mini review, we briefly discuss the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, its origin, diagnosis, and treatment. This study will provide an understanding of the role of artificial intelligence in this emerging COVID-19 pandemic along with the impact in our society, economy, health, and industrial level. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Among these discourses, coverage on influencers was prominent, likely as many of the issues arising from COVID-19 contingencies – such as digitalization, public messaging, and misinformation – are cornerstones of this digital economy. In response, this cross-cultural study draws on a corpus of Australian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean online news articles published between January and May 2020, to understand how local news ecologies were parsing the impacts of COVID-19 on influencers. From the coding of 150 news articles guided by Grounded Theory, this article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on influencers, and influencers’ engagements with and reactions to the pandemic. Our study of individual governments’ past engagements with their influencer industries suggest that local backstories and contexts are crucial to decipher why news angles tend to pitch particular stories on influencers. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus; COVID-19; influencers; press coverage; social media; wanghong  Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards covid-19 pandemic among quarantined adults in Tigrai region, Ethiopia Background: With the onset of any novel condition, it is the “first” case identified that brings attention and sets into motion the machinery to respond – so it began with a first novel pneumonia case of unknown origin in Wuhan, China. Currently, the World Health Organization has declared SARS-CoV-2 (more commonly known as COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern. It is projected that the path of COVID-19 could kill 50–80 million people and impacts the world’s economy in its devastating global sweep. The surge is increasing on global and national levels, causing rapid loss of life, joblessness, deterioration of the healthcare systems, and both national and global economies. In Ethiopia, the first COVID-19 case was reported in March. Since then, the government has been taking different measures to prevent its spread. Locking down all schools, declared social distancing and hand hygiene, and restricting large gatherings were some of the Ethiopian government’s actions. Objective: To determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 pandemic among quarantined adults in Tigrai region, Ethiopia. Methods: A total of 331 participants selected using a systematic random sampling method were included in the study. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire. After describing the variables using frequencies, means, and standard deviations, multivariable logistic regression determined factors associated with knowledge and chi-squared tests for attitudes and practices towards COVID-19. Results: The study participants were primarily males (70%) and mean age 30.5 (SD=11) years. The mean knowledge score was 8.73 (SD=2.64), with less than half 42.9% (95% CI: 37.5–48%) of the study participants were knowledgeable. Regarding the attitude questions, three-fourths of the participants believed that Ethiopia will control and win the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly one-third of the participants replied that the Ethiopian government is handling this pandemic health crisis well. About half of the study participants reported that they had gone to crowded places in recent days, did not wear face mask when leaving home, and practiced preventive measures given by local health authorities. Knowledge score was statistically significantly associated with gender, age, and educational status of the study participants, whereas attitude and practices were significantly associated with educational status and knowledge of participants. © 2020 Haftom et al.

It not only killed thousands of people but also the economy of most of the countries, leaving an unforgettable trail of devastation. COVID-19 also had a positive impact on nature as it was seen reclaiming itself due to the decrease in all kinds of pollution. It also brought families together in the form of a nation-wide lock down. Most of them were confined to the four walls of their homes. They had a chance to spend more time together, leading to better understanding, which in turn had an impact on the relationships between family members. Families are rooted on strong marital relationships and given that a pandemic of such a nature is the first of its kind in this century, it would be interesting to examine how the contextual changes induced by COVID-19 had impacted the marital relationships of individuals. A sample of 165 married respondents from Tamilnadu, the Southern-most state of India, were considered for the study. Marital Satisfaction and its antecedents were assessed on a 22-item likert scale. Statistical analysis revealed that interpersonal factors and sexual factors emerged as significant predictors of marital satisfaction. The study found that COVID-19 had an impact on the mindsets of people. Respondents in the green and orange zone, where there was a negligible incidence of COVID-19 had reported higher levels of marital satisfaction compared to the red zone, where there was the highest incidence of COVID-19 infections. This study has important implications with respect to the change in perceptions of people towards marital relationships, when they are exposed to a pandemic like COVID-19. © 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

COVID-19 is also a pandemic that is impacting socio-economic and political systems in profound ways. This paper briefly outlines why and how pandemics may expose uneven socio-economic geographies of vulnerability and risk, and also be thought of in relation to environmental and non-human challenges to our geopolitical map of territorial nation-states and sovereignties. In relation to Southeast Asia we argue that preexisting and ongoing political-economy linkages are shaping key responses to COVID-19. In particular, we consider the geopolitical and geoeconomic reasoning of Cambodia and Myanmar, and their relations with China. We reflect on the factors that shape their national responses in response to the pandemic, characterized by certain silences and erasures to their local geographies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

It can manifest with a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia or even fatality. One of the treatments suggested is convalescent plasma therapy. The study aims at assessing the general awareness about Covid-19 and knowledge about the role of Convalescent plasma therapy for treatment of Covid-19 among post graduate dental students. The survey was conducted among postgraduate dental students through an online survey tool using google forms. The survey was conducted online among postgraduate dental students on the go with 19 and convalescent plasma therapy.A total of 103 participant were included in the study. The responses were collected, tabulated and analysed using SPSS software. The knowledge regarding covid-19 and the awareness about the usefulness of convalescent plasma was variable. Around 90% of the participants were aware of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy. Advance training, proper PPE and training on handling the patients with any infectious disease should be dealt with in detail for reducing the spread from dental clinics and dentists. © 2020 Global Research Online.

However, these sectors are vulnerable and sensitive to natural hazards such as the COVID-19 pandemic and any resultant economic downturns. This study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on the global restaurant industry using data from OpenTable and other sources. The study found that sit-in guests dropped to zero in many countries as governments across the world instituted social distancing initiatives, movement restrictions and lockdowns. COVID-19 also led to an unprecedented loss of employment and revenue, resulting in millions of jobs and billions of dollars in potential revenue lost. The work recommends extra-ordinary financial and other support measures for the sector. It further recommends a raft of safety and health protocols as the industry gradually reopens. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. coronavirus; COVID-19; Hospitality industry; restaurants; tourism industry Coronavirus Challenges and silver linings of COVID-19 in Ethiopia –short review Difficult situations bring not only challenges but also fruitful opportunities. The pandemic of COVID-19 by itself and the related governmental or individual level measures have their own challenges and opportunities to the community, which even might be directly or indirectly related to the control and prevention of the pandemic. The silver linings of the pandemic of COVID-19 should be uncovered to encourage the community not only to focus on the black side of the disease but also to enjoy the opportunities. This can contribute to facilitate the control of the disease and avoid the related panics. In this review, we have discussed the challenges of COVID-19 in Ethiopia in terms of health, economy, and social life, and the silver linings in terms of research opportunities, technological transformation, reading culture, and family discussion. The literatures used in this review were published and unpublished articles, reports, and working papers from Google Scholar, PubMed, MedRxiv, BioRxiv, and official websites of national and international organizations. © 2020 Wondimu and Girma.

In India, it has become a public health disaster and its' intensity increasing continuously. For the disaster risk reduction, and capacity building against the COVID-19 pandemic understanding of the relationship between socio-environmental conditions with the pandemic is very necessary. The objective of the present work is to construct a socio-environmental vulnerability index of the potential risk of community spread of COVID-19 using socio-economic and environmental variables. Methodology: In this, cross-sectional study principal component analyses have been used to drive SoEVI. 4 uncorrelated sub-index has been extracted from 16 sub-indicators which reflects 59% of the variance. Aggregation of 4 Sub-Index has been done to obtain the final vulnerability Index. Results: Results show that there is spatial variability in vulnerability based on environmental and socio-economic conditions. Districts of north and central India found more vulnerable then south India. Statistical significance has been tested using regression analysis, positive relation has been found between vulnerability index and confirmed and active cases. Conclusion: The vulnerability index has highlighted environmentaly and socioeconomicallybackward districts. These areas will suffer more critical problems against COVID-19 pandemic for their socio-environmental problem. © 2020 INDIACLEN Community risk; Composite index; COVID-19; Pandemic; Vulnerability  A global analysis on the effect of temperature, socio-economic and environmental factors on the spread and mortality rate of the COVID-19 pandemic We performed a global analysis with data from 149 countries to test whether temperature can explain the spatial variability of the spread rate and mortality of COVID-19 at the global scale. We performed partial correlation analysis and linear mixed effect modelling to evaluate the association of the spread rate and motility of COVID-19 with maximum, minimum, average temperatures and diurnal temperature variation (difference between daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperature) and other environmental and socio-economic parameters. After controlling the effect of the duration since the first positive case, partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was not related with the spatial variability of the spread rate of COVID-19 at the global scale. Mortality was negatively related with temperature in the countries with high-income economies. In contrast, diurnal temperature variation was significantly and positively correlated with mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Taking the country heterogeneity into account, mixed effect modelling revealed that inclusion of temperature as a fixed factor in the model significantly improved model skill predicting mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis suggests that warm climate may reduce the mortality rate in high-income economies, but in low- and middle-income countries, high diurnal temperature variation may increase the mortality risk. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Clinical evidences demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces detrimental levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and significant systemic organ damage. Currently, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19 or associated complications, and with the hope of a safe and effective vaccine in the distant future, the search for an answer is paramount. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a viable option due to their immunomodulatory effects and tissue repair and regeneration abilities. Studies have demonstrated that compassionate use of MSCs can reduce symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminate fluid buildup, and act as a regenerative technique for alveolar damage; all in a safe and effective way. With multiple autologous sources available for MSCs, each with their own respective limitations, allogenic umbilical cord (UC) and/or UC-derived Wharton’s jelly (WJ) seem to be best positioned source to harvest MSCs to treat COVID-19 and associated symptoms. As an allogenic source, UC is readily available, easily obtainable, and is rich in immunomodulatory and regenerative factors. In this manuscript, we reviewed the current evidences and explored the potential therapeutic use of allogenic UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although, preliminary preclinical and clinical studies indicate that their use is safe and potentially effective, more multi-center, randomized, controlled trials are needed to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2020, Japan Human Cell Society.

To minimize or ignore the specialized needs of marginalized populations in the time of COVID-19 is to prolong the spread of the disease, social restrictions, and the ultimate recovery of the American economy, as those disproportionally impacted are often public-facing essential workers who cannot stay home and effectively social distance. This commentary discusses the advancement of social equity as an essential component of policy planning in the current pandemic and offers practical administrative strategies for achievement, including heeding the data, dialoguing with community, partners, and taking courageous action. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization coronavirus; COVID-19; health disparities; health equity; health policy; policy response; social equality; social equity; social justice; vulnerable populations  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the adult population in Bangladesh: a nationwide cross-sectional study The recent COVID-19 pandemic has imposed threats on both physical and mental health since its outbreak. This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among a representative sample of home-quarantined Bangladeshi adults. A cross-sectional design was used with an online survey completed by a convenience sample recruited via social media. A total of 1,427 respondents were recruited, and their mental health was assessed by the DASS-21 measure. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 33.7% and 57.9%, respectively, and 59.7% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental health outcomes. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that sociodemographic factors and perceptions of COVID-19 significantly predict mental health outcomes. These findings warrant the consideration of easily accessible low-intensity mental health interventions during and beyond this pandemic. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2 weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper critically analyses publicly available data. Findings: The South African government's initial health response was praised by the international community, given the early lockdown and extensive testing regime. The lockdown devastated an already precarious economy, which led to negative social consequences. The initial lockdown delayed the epidemic, but subsequently, the infection rate climbed, requiring new restrictions, suggesting further economic disruption. The government has had to increase its borrowings, while the future tax take is forecast to be significantly reduced, a combination which will lead to a severely constrained public purse for many years to come. This will limit the government's ability to address the basic social needs that predated the COVID-19 crisis. Originality/value: This is one of the first academic papers to critically assess the effect of the South African government's response to the COVID-19 crisis on state finances and budgets. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; DEMATEL; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Lockdown; Pandemic; Relaxed measures  Guidance for Cardiac Electrophysiology during the COVID-19 Pandemic from the Heart Rhythm Society COVID-19 Task Force; Electrophysiology Section of the American College of Cardiology; and the Electrocardiography and Arrhythmias Committee of the Council on Clinical Cardiology, American Heart Association Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that is wreaking havoc on the health and economy of much of human civilization. Electrophysiologists have been impacted personally and professionally by this global catastrophe. In this joint article from representatives of the Heart Rhythm Society, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association, we identify the potential risks of exposure to patients, allied healthcare staff, industry representatives, and hospital administrators. We also describe the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac arrhythmias and methods of triage based on acuity and patient comorbidities. We provide guidance for managing invasive and noninvasive electrophysiology procedures, clinic visits, and cardiac device interrogations. In addition, we discuss resource conservation and the role of telemedicine in remote patient care along with management strategies for affected patients. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Statistics show worryingly, at the beginning of May there were almost 4 million diseases and almost 250,000 deaths in the world. More than 1 million diseases are registered in the USA, Italy, Great Britain, Spain, France, and Russia. This extremely difficult context has led us to make a comparative analysis of the measures that the governments of the states of the European Union have taken to manage it. Our paper analyses the cooperation between the European Union and the states in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper contains some recommendations for the governments of the Member States to solve the problems of their health systems and to relaunch the economy in the European space. The results of the research are useful and interesting for the governments of the EU member states, which should have a unitary and coherent strategy to avoid economic and social imbalances. The recommendations contained in this paper can be a reference and source of inspiration for the EU institutions to develop a coherent strategy for a rapid social and economic recovery. © 2020, Bucharest University of Economic Studies Publishing House.

The disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and is the causative agent of a very fatal disease that has had global implications, in healthcare, medical resources and the financial economies. The SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to have a zoonotic origin, based on the reports of the virus originating from the animal market in Wuhan, China. The disease is spread amongst humans via direct contact and respiratory droplets. The virus mainly infects the respiratory system and also involves other major organ systems. As this is a novel coronavirus, there has not been many studies regarding the virus’s infectivity and treatment. However, since its emergence, efforts have been made to differentiate it from other diseases having a similar presentation, for treatment and for production of a vaccine. In this manuscript, we aim to highlight the important traits of the novel coronavirus, the disease COVID-19 and its presentation. The particular focus is based on the effects of COVID-19 on human health and its available therapeutic measure. At the time of this pandemic, the global health systems were not adequately sufficed to appropriately deal with it. Most importantly, and unfortunately, the health care personnel and their health is being largely overlooked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The manuscript is, therefore, an effort to draw the world’s attention towards the role of health care workers, the problems they are facing as the frontline soldiers in this unforeseen battlefield and their sustenance during this COVID-19 pandemic situation. The doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff is dealing the COVID-19 suspects and patients on daily basis with merely available precautionary measures across the globe, consequently putting their lives and wellbeing on risks for the sake of humanity. And, with the support of scientific literature and other reliable resources, we aimed with this viewpoint manuscript to highlight the COVID-19 related challenges to global health system, in particular context to health care personnel. © 2020 The Author(s).

A disruption to the interdependence of the two largest economies seemed unfathomable. However, in an effort to thwart China’s economic practices and boost the US economy, President Trump’s administration levied tariffs on Chinese imports shortly after taking office, moving US foreign economic policy from liberalism, practiced for decades, to protectionism. China has retaliated, and the trade war continues today. With conceptual insights from the nationalism literature, we explore the nationalist roots of the trade war from both the US and Chinese perspectives. In the USA, the Trump administration’s plan to achieve energy autonomy, decrease reliance on foreign resources, and reinvigorate the manufacturing sector has led to protectionist policies, the othering of China, and hence the trade war. Although reluctant to enter the conflict, China has rebuffed the USA, resisting and counterattacking US actions, owing to a long-felt sense of persecution in the global space and an eagerness to participate fully, and lead in some issue areas, in international affairs. The conflict continues into the COVID-19 era, marked by US scapegoating of China and hits to economic performance. Until both sides are convinced they have achieved their goals, or the USA undergoes an administration change, the conflict will likely continue. © 2020, Fudan University.

In Indonesia, the plague has become a serious concern by the government. Especially in South Sulawesi, Bone, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase. As a result, many community needs cannot be fulfilled. The purpose of this study is to analyze the needs of the community in Bone during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information of this study will later be used for reference in further research. The research began from March 20 to April 15, 2020, researchers conducted a survey using an online questionnaire. This research involved 1502 respondents, using a purposive sampling technique. In general, physical needs are in the medium category (M = 9.61; SD = 1.96), health is in the medium category (M = 9.50; SD = 1.84), psychological is in the medium category (M = 9.64; SD = 1.92), social is classified in the medium category (M = 9.73; SD = 1.86), the economy is in the medium category (M = 9.34; SD = 1.93), and spiritual is in the medium category (M = 9.66; SD = 1.97). The results of this study report that the level of fulfillment of community needs is in the moderate category, so the government must act quickly to overcome the problem. The findings from this study can be used to help people's lives to be more quality and prosperous during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

The Netherlands started with containment and shifted to mitigation within three weeks when implementing a ‘mild’ lockdown. The initial focus was to obtain herd immunity while preventing Intensive Care Units from getting overwhelmed. Methods: An in-depth analysis of available national and international COVID-19 data sources was conducted. Due to regional variation in COVID-19 hospitalization rates, this paper focuses on three distinct regions; the initial epicenter; the most northern provinces which – contrary to national policy – decided not to switch to mitigation; and the Bible Belt, as congregations of religious groups were initially excluded from the ban on group formation. Results: On August 11th, 6,159 COVID-19 deaths were reported with at the peak an excess mortality Z-score of 21.7. As a result of the pandemic, the economy took a severe hit and is predicted to shrink 6.5% compared to projection. The hospitalization rates in the northern regions were over 70% lower compared to the rest of the country (18 versus 66 per 100,000 inhabitants). Differences between the Bible Belt and the rest of the country were hardly detectable. Conclusion: The Dutch have shown a way to effectively slow down transmission while allowing more personal and economic freedom than most other countries. Furthermore, the regional differences suggest that containment prevented a surge of infections in the northern provinces. The results should be interpreted with caution, due to the descriptive nature of this study. © 2020 COVID-19; Economic effects; Health effects; Health policy; Health system; Regulated competition; The Netherlands  Optimal policy learning for COVID-19 prevention using reinforcement learning COVID-19 has changed the lifestyle of many people due to its rapid human-to-human transmission. The spread started at the end of January 2020, and different countries used different approaches in terms of testing, sanitization, lock down and quarantine centres to control the spread of the virus. People are getting back to working and routine life activities with new normal standards of testing, sanitization, social distancing and lock down. People are regularly tested to identify those who are infected with COVID-19 and isolate them from general public. However, testing all people unnecessarily is an expensive operation in terms of resources usage. There must be an optimal policy to test only those who have higher chances of being COVID-19 positive. Similarly, sanitization is used for individuals and streets to disinfect people and places. However, sanitization is also an expensive operation in terms of resources, and it is not possible to disinfect each and every individual and street. Social separating or lock down or quarantine centres focuses are different methodologies that are utilised to control the human-to-human transmission of the infection and separate the individuals who are contaminated with COVID-19. However, lock down and quarantine centres are expensive operations in terms of resources as it disturbs the affairs of state and the growth of economy. At the same time, it negatively affects the quality of life of a society. It is also not possible to provide resources to all citizens by locking them inside homes or quarantine centres for infinite time. All these parameters are expensive in terms of resources and have an effect on controlling the spread of the virus, quality of life of human, resources and economy. In this article, a novel intelligent method based on reinforcement learning (RL) is built up that quantifies the unique levels of testing, disinfection and lock down alongside its impact on the spread of the infection, personal satisfaction or quality of life, resource use and economy. Different RL algorithms are actualized and agents are prepared with these algorithms to interact with the environment to gain proficiency with the best strategy. The examinations exhibit that deep learning–based algorithms, for example, DQN and DDPG are performing better than customary RL algorithms, for example, Q-Learning and SARSA. © The Author(s) 2020.

Forced emergence to find an effective vaccine to immunize people has led scientists to design and examine vaccine candidates all over the world. Until a vaccine is developed, however, effective treatment is needed to combat this virus, which is resistant to all conventional antiviral drugs. Accordingly, more about the structure, entry mechanism, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 is required. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the gateway to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, so our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 can help us to complete its mechanism of interaction with ACE2 and virus endocytosis, which can be interrupted by neutralizing small molecules or proteins. ACE2 also plays a crucial role in lung injury. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC ACE2; angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ARDS; COVID-19; miRNA; SARS-CoV-2  Short-term forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic using Google Trends data: Evidence from 158 countries The ability of Google Trends data to forecast the number of new daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 is examined using a dataset of 158 countries. The analysis includes the computations of lag correlations between confirmed cases and Google data, Granger causality tests, and an out-of-sample forecasting exercise with 18 competing models with a forecast horizon of 14 days ahead. This evidence shows that Google-augmented models outperform the competing models for most of the countries. This is significant because Google data can complement epidemiological models during difficult times like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, when official statistics maybe not fully reliable and/or published with a delay. Moreover, real-time tracking with online-data is one of the instruments that can be used to keep the situation under control when national lockdowns are lifted and economies gradually reopen. © 2020 Sinergia Press.

Some countries have started reopening their economies under the threat of a second wave because studies show that only 4% of the population is infected so far and more waves will be needed to achieve herd immunity. Lockdowns have been used with a primary purpose of regulating the demand for healthcare while ignoring the economic consequences. Contrary to the lockdown strategy, some countries such as Brazil have given priority to their economy leading to very high infection and mortality rates. After a first wave of the pandemic, we now know something critically important—those who are likely to become seriously ill and potentially die if SARS-CoV-2 infection is not prevented. That information cannot be ignored in our strategy and is used to control the pandemic. The paper proposes to focus on managing the risk of the virus being transmitted to the vulnerable rather than focusing on controlling all who can potentially transmit it. It argues that only 4% of the global population is at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected. We propose to target this 4% of the population for preventive efforts. Protecting the vulnerable via lockdowns and other mea-sures will be more effective and efficient than locking down the entire population and destroying their economies that are equally critical to life. We hypothesize that such “targeted prevention” strategies are more likely to help achieve our goals: 1) reduce mortality by preventing the infection reaching its potential victims, 2) spend the resources efficiently by knowing the “target” of our preventive efforts, and 3) achieve effective and efficient control of the pandemic without causing disruption to the socio-economic activities until an effective vaccine is available. © 2020 Govindarajan.

For some, location-aware applications are primarily a producer of geospatial Big Data required for vital geospatial analysis and visualization of the spread of the disease in a state of emergency. For others, comprehensive tracking of citizens constitutes a dangerous violation of fundamental rights. Commercial web-based location-aware applications both collect data and—through spatial analysis and connection to services—provide value to users. This value is what motivates users to share increasingly private and comprehensive data. The willingness of users to share data in return for services has been a key concern with web-based variants of the technology since the beginning. With a focus on two privacy preserving CoViD-19 contact tracking applications, this survey walks through the key steps of developing a privacy preserving context-aware application: from types of applications and business models, through architectures and privacy strategies, to representations. © 2020, The Author(s).

The research illustrates that the effects of the pandemic are strongly felt in mobility in the socio-economic sectors. Design/Methodology/Approach: To give answer to the research question whether COVID-19 pandemic has impact on socio-economic mobility in Indonesia, firstly, we review the literature to find out what different scholars have found in recent researches concerning this subject as well as the current issue and the methods and models used in collecting, processing, and analyzing data. The processing of the data of the above-mentioned reports has been done by SPSS software program, specifically using regression. Findings: The possible impacts caused a decrease in socio-economic activities and reduced community income. The results of the correlation analysis showed that there was a strong relationship between a pandemic tested positive for COVID-19 and mortality rates with socio-economic conditions with an average correlation coefficient above 0.80. Practical Implications: This paper will provide a detail analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic mobility, with this impact, government policies relating to human life, economic policies to increase state expenditure (government expenditure), and tax incentives must be made. Furthermore, monetary policy that can accelerate the increase in production by reducing the cost of production through the cost of capital and reduce energy prices becomes an essential choice. Originality/Value: This research paper highlights an empirical analysis based on real data of socio economy mobility in Indonesia. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

Therefore, firms are now trying to identify the ways for enhancing survivability of Sustainable Supply Chains (SSCs). This study has made an effort to develop a framework for enhancing survivability of SSCs to survive in and post-COVID-19 pandemic. This study has utilised Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method for identifying the significant factors for enhancing survivability of SSCs to be focused in pandemic situation. The study revealed that ‘Supply Chain Network Viability (SCV)’ is the main criterion for managing buyer–supplier relationship and enhancing survivability of SSCs during and post-COVID-19 situation. This study is helpful for firms, suppliers, and other stakeholders to focus on the identified factors for healthier future. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. buyer–supplier relationship; COVID-19 pandemic; digital data-driven SCs; survivability; Sustainable supply chains (SSCs); viability  Impact of COVID-19 on Forecasting Stock Prices: An Integration of Stationary Wavelet Transform and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory COVID-19 is an infectious disease that mostly affects the respiratory system. At the time of this research being performed, there were more than 1.4 million cases of COVID-19, and one of the biggest anxieties is not just our health, but our livelihoods, too. In this research, authors investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy, more specifically, the impact of COVID-19 on the financial movement of Crude Oil price and three US stock indexes: DJI, S&P 500, and NASDAQ Composite. The proposed system for predicting commodity and stock prices integrates the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BDLSTM) networks. Firstly, SWT is used to decompose the data into approximation and detail coefficients. After decomposition, data of Crude Oil price and stock market indexes along with COVID-19 confirmed cases were used as input variables for future price movement forecasting. As a result, the proposed system BDLSTM + WT-ADA achieved satisfactory results in terms of five-day Crude Oil price forecast. © 2020 Daniel Štifanić et al.

Early strategic planning and groundwork for evolving and established challenges are crucial to assemble resources and react in an appropriate timely manner. This article, therefore, focuses on the public perception of comparative lockdown scenario analysis and how they may affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the strategic management regime of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh socio-economically as well as the implications of the withdrawal of partial lockdown plan. Scenario-based public perceptions were collected via a purposive sampling survey method through a questionnaire. Datasets were analysed through a set of statistical techniques including classical test theory, principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearson’s correlation matrix and linear regression analysis. There were good associations among the lockdown scenarios and response strategies to be formulated. Scenario 1 describes how the death and infection rate will increase if the Bangladesh Government withdraws the existing partial lockdown. Scenario 2 outlines that limited people’s movement will enable low-level community transmission of COVID-19 with the infection and death rate will increase slowly (r = 0.540, p < 0.01). Moreover, there will be less supply of necessities of daily use with a price hike (r = 0.680, p < 0.01). In scenario 3, full lockdown will reduce community transmission and death from COVID-19 (r = 0.545, p < 0.01). However, along with the other problems gender discrimination and gender-based violence will increase rapidly (r = 0.661, p < 0.01). Due to full lockdown, the formal and informal business, economy, and education sector will be hampered severely (R = 0.695). Subsequently, there was a strong association between the loss of livelihood and the unemployment rate which will increase due to business shutdown (p < 0.01). This will lead to the severe sufferings of poor and vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas (p < 0.01). All these will further aggravate the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in the country in the coming months to be followed which will undoubtedly affect the Bangladesh targets to achieve the SDGs of 2030 and other development plans that need to be adjusted. From our analysis, it was apparent that maintaining partial lockdown with business and economic activities with social distancing and public health guidelines is the best strategy to maintain. However, as the government withdrew the partial lockdown, inclusive and transparent risk communication towards the public should be followed. Recovery and strengthening of the health sector, economy, industry, agriculture, and food security should be focused on under the “new normal standard of life” following health guidelines and social distancing. Proper response plans and strategic management are necessary for the sustainability of the nation. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Comparatively, there are more success stories by SMEs in emerging markets. However, most SMEs operating in the informal sector in the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) face similar challenges that inhibit the adoption of advanced technologies and innovations needed to improve business operations and re-engineer processes. This article evaluates the implementation and use of state-of-the-art technologies by SMEs in EMDEs to improve operations performance and create sustainable competitive advantages. Further, the papers in this Special Issue identify FinTech and analytical algorithms as some of the current technologies employed by SMEs in EMDEs to improve operations and processes in the manufacturing and service industries. The recognized technologies and technical innovations that seem novel in EMDEs have long existed in the advanced economies. Most state-of-the-art technologies, including cloud computing, 'big data', and predictive analytics that can improve operations and strategic decisions, are yet to make inroads in most EMDEs. Also, disruptive computing technologies, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) required to engineer new business models, reduce overheads, enhance competitive advantages, and digitize SMEs' business operations remain untapped. The absence and non-adoption of digital technologies in EMDEs explain why business activities in most EMDEs remain shut during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the community lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies to survive the 'new normal' imposed by COVID-19 and fierce global competition includes a successful adoption of advanced technologies. © 2020 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.

This article used an event study method to calculate the abnormal returns (AR) in the 10 trading days following the outbreak, from which it was found that both the Chinese and Asian stock markets had significantly declined, with the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) remaining negative in all the examined event window periods. This article also analysed the different industry index responses to the epidemic, from which it was found that the pharmaceutical manufacturing, software and IT services both had positive CAR, while transportation, lodging and catering had negative CAR during the event window. These results reflected the investors’ expectations for the different industries and the economy as a whole under the outbreak of the contagious coronavirus. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. abnormal return; COVID-19; investor sentiments; stock market indices  Brazilian Child Protection Professionals’ Resilient Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic Background: The COVID-19 pandemic deeply affected child protection professionals. One potential area of concern is whether and how the pandemic has dampened these individuals’ ability to engage in the resilient practices that are so vital to their wellbeing. Objective: Within the unique and understudied context of a developing economy facing the strain of an international pandemic, this study sought to expand our theoretical understanding of the individual and socio-ecological predictors of whether child protective services professionals engage in resilient behaviors. Participants and setting: Three hundred and nine professionals working in child protection related fields (e.g., psychologists, social workers, professors, pediatricians, nurses, and other clinicians). Methods: Participants were surveyed as to their demographics, current work conditions, their engagement in resilient behaviors, and potential individual and socio-ecological predictors of those behaviors. Results: Both job support for and individuals’ beliefs of the importance of resilient behaviors predicted their engagement in such behaviors. Conclusions: Child protection professionals' resilience must be fostered by socio-ecological contexts, such as their workplace and employers, and additional supports are needed during the trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Child Maltreatment; Child Protection; COVID-19; Psychological Resilience  Economic perspective of coronavirus (COVID-19) This study aims to present a quick overview of the novel coronavirus (afterward COVID-19) which triggers from Wuhan, spread approximately 213 countries and territories around the globe, and still currently ongoing. Particularly, we are interested to investigate the economic perspective of COVID-19. This paper uses data from online published articles and current media sources, as the COVID-19 situation is unfolding yet. To deeply explore the said matter, we divide the economic impact into six dimensions that is, Chinese economy, Central Asian economies, South Asian economies, South East and West Asian economies, European economies, Northern African, and Middle Eastern economies. The paper concludes that epidemic situations like COVID-19 severely affect economies around the globe. The basic reasons behind such severity are immobility of labor, reduction in productivity, discontinuation of the supply chain, a decline in exports, uncertainty, and so on. This study is quite important for businesses and policymakers to estimate and plan current and post-COVID-19 situations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd   The COVID-19 pandemic in Norway: The dominance of social implications in framing the policy response Objectives: To describe the impact and policy response to the COVID-19 Pandemic on Norway and the implications this has for future policy development and Norwegian society. Methods: Documentary analysis of publicly available statistics, government documents and media sources. Results: Three different agendas motivated Norwegian policy: stemming the spread of the virus domestically, mitigating the impact on the economy and addressing the social costs of the policy response. Conclusions: The oil and gas industry and the Sovereign Wealth Fund have permitted Norway to manage the costs of the pandemic. But may also lead to a shift in government priorities in health, social and economic policy. © 2020 COVID-19; Norway; Policy; Social impact  Effect of COVID-19 outbreak on urban health and environment The WHO announced coronavirus disease a Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and it spreads across the whole planet. Aftermath of outbreak of this disease at the global level is more frightening and panicking than anyone’s worst nightmare. With more than 23 mln positive coronavirus cases and more than 800,000 causalities all over the world, the potential of this virus cannot be undermined. This pandemic has victimized all human beings residing on 209 countries and territories of the world. It emerged as an unbeatable global challenge that the world has never witnessed before. Consequently, the affected countries have sealed their borders and made populations reside in their homes until the pandemic is over. Thus, the victims of coronavirus are not only the ones who are exposed to it but also the ones who are affected by the lockdown imposed by the governments. The paper aims to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on air pollution of various countries. Papers indicating the relationship between air pollution levels and lockdown measures are analyzed. The dramatic U-turn from environmental degradation is definitely a silver lining in these black clouds. This paper reviews the repercussions of the pandemic in some nations, while war-like preparations continue to fight it. COVID-19 has dramatically improved the quality of air. Also, it has greatly affected the economy of various countries due to lockdown. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V. Air pollution; COVID-19; Urban health  Enhanced Gaussian process regression-based forecasting model for COVID-19 outbreak and significance of IoT for its detection Virus based epidemic is one of the speedy and widely spread infectious disease which can affect the economy of the country as well as it is life-threatening too. So, there is a need to forecast the epidemic lifespan, which can help us in taking preventive measures and remedial action on time. These preventive measures and corrective action may consist of closing schools, closing malls, closing theaters, sealing of borders, suspension of public services, and suspension of traveling. Resuming such restrictions is depends upon the outbreak momentum and its decay rate. The accurate forecasting of the epidemic lifespan is one of the enormously essential and challenging tasks. It is a challenging task because the lack of knowledge about the novel virus-based diseases and its consequences with complicated societal-governmental factors can influence the widespread of this newly born disease. At this stage, any forecasting can play a vital role, and it will be reliable too. As we know, the novel virus-based diseases are in a growing phase, and we also do not have real-time data samples. Thus, the biggest challenge is to find out the machine learning-based best forecasting model, which could offer better forecasting with the limited training samples. In this paper, the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) regression model with enhanced predictions of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is proposed. The purpose of the proposed MTGP regression model is to predict the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide. It will help the countries in planning their preventive measures to reduce the overall impact of the speedy and widely spread infectious disease. The result of the proposed model has been compared with the other prediction model to find out its suitability and correctness. In subsequent analysis, the significance of IoT based devices in COVID-19 detection and prevention has been discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

For example, South Korea has been criticised for its use of privacy-infringing digital contact-tracing. However, whether their type of digital contact-tracing was unnecessarily harmful to the human rights of Korean citizens is open for debate. The purpose of this paper is to examine this criticism to see if Korea’s digital contact-tracing is ethically justifiable. Design/methodology/approach: This paper will evaluate Korea’s digital contact-tracing through the lens of the four human rights principles to determine if their response is ethically justifiable. These four principles were originally outlined in the European Court of Human Rights, namely, necessary, proportional, scientifically valid and time-bounded (European Court of Human Rights 1950). Findings: The paper will propose that while the use of Korea’s digital contact-tracing was scientifically valid and proportionate (albeit, in need for improvements), it meets the necessity requirement, but is too vague to meet the time-boundedness requirement. Originality/value: The Covid-19 pandemic has proven to be one of the worst threats to human health and the global economy in the past century. There have been many different strategies to tackle the pandemic, from somewhat laissez-faire approaches, herd immunity, to strict draconian measures. Analysis of the approaches taken in the response to the pandemic is of high scientific value and this paper is one of the first to critically engage with one of these methods – digital contact-tracing in South Korea. © 2020, Mark Ryan.

It analyses how the contradictions of Australian higher education, driven by expanding participation in the higher education system within the context of contained public funding, have been politically managed through regulatory regimes that link the public university with the neoliberal capitalist economy. Such modes of state intervention have been dependent on financialized instruments such as income contingent loans, the education–migration nexus, and precarious work. These regulatory instruments, embedded within a project of market citizenship, have both managed and expanded the marketization of higher education while also expanding participation. It is this regulatory model of market citizenship that is now facing a crisis of crisis management. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

There is hardly a country in the world that is not currently facing this problem. The number of cases is constantly growing, patients and carriers being the main mode of transmission. The economies of all countries are at stake. However, people need essential goods and food, regardless of the situation. In this respect, agriculture, food industry, food market, and catering have become priority industries. A continuous operation of food service enterprises (FSE) is crucial for the uninterrupted food supply in the period of preventive measures. The paper describes how pathogen makes its way into FSEs, spreads, and infects people. This information makes it possible to assess the probability of coronavirus infection and to reduce its spread, thus ensuring the safe operation of the enterprise. There are three transmission routes the coronavirus can take at a FSE: (1) aerial transmission by droplets and aerosols during the main and secondary technological production processes, (2) person-to-person transmission from clients to staff or from employee to employee via direct or indirect contact, (3) transmission via contaminated surfaces, e.g. packaging, furniture, equipment, etc. FSEs have to follow the recommendations published by the federal and/or local authorities, which may vary depending on the COVID-19 incidence rate in the area. These recommendations are based on the probability of the public health risk associated with person-to-person transmission, rather than on food safety. © 2020, Mayurnikova et al.

Vaccine safety and efficacy requires meticulous testing and oversight; this paper describes how despite grandiose public statements, the current vaccine development, testing, and production methods may prove to be ethically dubious, medically dangerous, and socially volatile. The basic moral concern is the potential danger to the health of human test subjects and, eventually, many vaccine recipients. This is further complicated by economic and political pressures to reduce government oversight on rushed vaccine testing and production, nationalistic distribution goals, and failure to plan for the widespread immunization needed to produce global herd immunity. As this paper asserts, the public must be better informed to assess promises about the novel vaccines being produced and to tolerate delays and uncertainty. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

Design/methodology/approach: The article applies abjection to understand how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is both a medical emergency but also a cultural challenge. The analysis is structured in three dimensions: (1) the transgressive potential of the virus, (2) forms of cultural coping with its threat and (3) the moral order of abjection. Findings: The virus is an existential challenge to cultural boundaries and subjectivity. Strategies to prevent its further spread (e.g. handwashing, “social distancing” and closing national borders) are thus culturally significant. The virus triggers the processes of abjection, (re-)establishing challenged boundaries and exclusionary social hierarchies. Collateral consequences of protective measures vary across regions and social groups, creating and exacerbating social inequalities. Research limitations/implications: Practices of abjecting the virus go far beyond handwashing, masking, etc. The virus, an invisible enemy to be expunged, is also a hybrid of threatening pathogen and human body; it is not the virus but people who experience exclusion, discrimination and disrespect. Thus, cultural sociology must address the moral economy of abjection. Social implications: As Kristeva insists, the abject threatens both the subject and the symbolic order. Overcoming social abjection means recognizing and strengthening individual and community agency and requires understanding vulnerability as an anthropological condition, enacting caring relationships and acting in solidarity. Originality/value: This article demonstrates that abjection is a suitable theoretical tool for analyzing the social dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

By assessing the differential impact of the pandemic on women and men in the United States across several sectors of the political economy and society, it is apparent women face immense obstacles in the labor market, as well as in access to health, food and housing. This analytical approach is in line with the United Nation’s fifth Sustainable Development Goal, gender equity. The imperative to include women’s perspectives in pandemic response and planning is juxtaposed against the current pandemic response that primarily leaves women out of the decision-making process. The policy tool of gender responsive budgeting, successfully implemented in various countries, is proposed to offset the gender inequities triggered by the pandemic in the U.S. © 2020 Public Administration Theory Network.

A communicable disease with high intense spread rates originated from China. As a result the world has locked all its gates, lockdown prevails in the entire world. Economy-the most affected sector in any country, daily life living is now restricted. The main aim of this study is to test the knowledge and create awareness on various attributes that are related to the Indian economy among the Trichy popula-tion. A self assessed questionnaire containing 14 questions about Indian economy during COVID 19 were framed and was shared through an online survey platform. The questionnaire was passed to 109 individuals. Responses from them were collected and were analysed through SPSS. Many residents from Trichy are aware about various aspects that affect our economy. Most of the responses from them were relevant and correct, emphasizing that they are already aware in these Fields. Pandemic plays an important role in deciding a country’s economy. It shows its effects on all sectors of the government. Mea-sures should be adopted by the citizens in order to escape from this economic fever. © 2020, J. K. Welfare and Pharmascope Foundation.

Many countries are under lockdown, the economy has ground to a halt, and almost everyone is afraid of dire consequences. The unprecedented changes that came on so quickly due to the pandemic and stay-at-home confinement to accomplish social distancing and mitigate risk for infection pose many challenges. These include compromised health, well-being, and sleep as a consequence of disruption of the daily life routine, anxiety, worry, isolation, greater family and work stress, and excessive screen time. Our study of 203 corporate sector professionals performing ‘9–5ʹ work from home during this phase of the pandemic and of 325 undergraduate and postgraduate university students substantiates, relative to the before lockdown condition, more extensive feelings of sleepiness, with significantly (p < .05) increased daytime nap duration, and depressive symptomatology (p < .001) that is a matter of concern. Moreover, the chronic stress of living through a pandemic led to a host of physical symptoms, like headaches, insomnia, digestive problems, hormonal imbalances, and fatigue. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

[A pandemia da COVID-19 no Japão: Contenção fracassada ou bemsucedida?] [La pandemia de COVID-19 en Japón: ¿contención fallida o exitosa?] This short article examines key governmental measures against the spread of COVID-19 in Japan from a geopolitical perspective. “Geopolitical” in this article means to see the measures as spatial strategies. At the stage of globalized pandemic, state territoriality or border control is no longer able to effectively control the spread of the virus. Instead, this article argues, multi-scalar intergovernmental coordination is inevitable to tackle the virus moving along increasing trans-border/local human flows. Using the case of Japan, this article overviews how effective social distancing as a spatial strategy has been and illustrates how the limits to such a strategy to control human behavior can affect anti-virus measures. In conclusion, this article argues that the effective devolution of state power to local governments and the strengthening of state supplementary function to sustain local healthcare system and economy would be more desirable than the authoritative concentration of state power in the state of emergency. © 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

During the state of emergency, the federal government made a firm decision to flatten the infection curve and to protect especially at-risk populations. During the lockdown period, the focus of the political debate shifted from health to the economy as the Federal Council (i.e., the national executive) started to prepare for the country's reopening. While government still had full power due to the emergency situation defined under national epidemic law, the shift in the debate also meant a shift in the way that the government made decisions. Switzerland is a power-sharing consociational democracy with strong neo-corporatist features. While the executive untypically relied heavily on health experts within and outside the administration during the lockdown, the reopening strategy shows clear features of Swiss neo-corporatism, including the resurgence and influence of the traditional big economic vested interests over the government's approach to decision making. © 2020 Policy Studies Organization consociationalism; COVID-19; neo-corporatism; pandemic policy response; Switzerland  War economy and the COVID-19 pandemic: Inequalities in stimulus packages as an additional challenge for health systems [краткое описание не найдено]  coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; financial deficit; funding; gross national product; health care system; health insurance; health workforce; hospital bed capacity; household; housing; human; income; industrial production; intensive care unit; isolation; learning; leishmaniasis; leprosy; Letter; low income country; middle income country; military phenomena; pandemic; poverty; sanitation; schistosomiasis; social distance; telemedicine; tourism; tuberculosis; unemployment; war economy; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; economics; health care planning; health care policy; organization and management; pandemic; socioeconomics; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Policy; Health Systems Plans; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Socioeconomic Factors Generation Z pharmacy students discernment and inclination towards online education in India during the COVID-19 pandemic The globe is combating COVID-19 and a lockout has been announced by economies around the world. Work from home (WFH) has now become the standard, particularly for service organizations including educational institutions. Furthermore, the institutions of higher learning had to close down unexpectedly, disrupting the educational operation, according to government orders. Therefore, they needed to consider new approaches to the teaching process, and the path ahead was digital classrooms. In India, around 32 crore learners halted to move school/colleges and all instructive exercises brought to a conclusion. Be that as it may, the questions almost the readiness, planning, and viability of e-learning is still not caught on, especially for a creating nation like India, where the specialized imperatives like reasonableness of gadgets and transmission capacity accessibility postures a genuine challenge. Despite all these challenges, the Higher Instruction Educate (HIE) has responded empathetically and overseen to guarantee the coherence of teaching-learning, inquire about and benefit to the community with a few apparatuses and methods amid the pandemic. In this study, we will center on understanding Generation Z pharmacy student's discernment and inclination towards internet learning through an online review of 300 respondents. We will likewise investigate the understudy’s inclination for different traits of online classes; which will be useful to structure viable learning conditions. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

Media commentators suggested that this technology was being used to connect with places and nature; an observation mirrored by webcam hosting organisations. This study examines the surge in popularity of these webcams which reflect a wide range of sites – often natural environments. It goes on to explore the attributes of webcam-travel to explain its rise during lockdown, primarily by employing an online questionnaire. It reveals that this experience is marked by feelings of freedom, nostalgia, and connection – each of which offers potential wellness benefits. Respondents exercised their freedom through these virtual portals to connect to nature, the outdoors, and places that they associated with happy memories pre-lockdown. This article also suggests that webcam-travel links to an increased likelihood to physically visit these sites in the future. Therefore, this research may be relevant to both academics and practitioners with an interest in the experience economy. © The Author(s) 2020. connection; COVID-19; freedom; lockdown; nature; nostalgia; place; Webcam-travel; webcams; wellness  Covid-19, international financial institutions and the continuity of androcentric policies in Latin America [Covid-19, instituciones financieras internacionales y continuidad de las políticas androcéntricas en América Latina] This article analyses, from a human rights and feminist economy perspective, the emergency financial policies deployed by the international financial institutions (IFIs)-in particular the IMF and the World Bank-to help States in Latina America to cope with the Covid-19 crisis. The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions as well as the underlying economic policies behind the loans that IFIs are granting to States are studied, identifying clear signals that fiscal discipline and pro-market options will continue being the priorities as soon as the emergency has been overcome. The study explains how the adjustment and austerity policies implemented in the countries in the region have adversely and disproportionally affected women's rights, in particular reinforcing the invisibilization of gender inequalities in the domestic and care work and how this situation, in turn, has put women in a situation of greater vulnerability to the pandemic. It also criticizes the (self)called ""gender approach"" of IFIs for being merely instrumental to economic growth without consideration to the intrinsic value of gender equality and women's rights. The responsibility of IFIs for complicity with economic reforms with known adverse effects on gender equality is studied. Given the policy and legal implications of the findings presented in this research, the article concludes that States in the region should consider carefully the conditions of the loans being offered by IFIs, for which it is crucial to conduct ex ante evaluations of the impact of these financial contacts on the human rights of the population, and in particular on gender equality. © Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

The stock market information of the top 32 coronavirus affected economies (as of 31st March 2020) was sampled for ex-ante and ex-post COVID-19 outbreak analysis using the Detrended Moving Cross-Correlation Analysis (DMCA) and Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) techniques. The results confirm a fractal contagion effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock markets. Furthermore, this fractal contagion effect fizzles out over time (in the middle and long run) for both the stock markets return and volatility. Therefore, this article provides pieces of evidence for the COVID-19 fractal contagion effect on the stock markets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics have been partially described in some observational studies. Not enough systematic reviews on predictors of critical illness and mortality in COVID 19 have been published to date. In this review, we had illustrated the prognostic predictors of COVID-19 by gathering published information on the risk factors related to the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections. © 2020 Aly et al.

Two Lessons from the First Global Crisis of a Digital Age Coronavirus is the first global crisis of a digital age and the divergence in policy responses reflects the challenge of navigating an unprecedented global situation under conditions of enormous uncertainty. We ask what lessons can be learned from this experience and identify two, both of which push against mainstream interpretations of recent events. First, and contrary to the view that the crisis exposed social media and Big Tech as a source of dangerous misinformation that needs to be regulated more strictly, the paper argues that the less mediated spaces of the Internet—social media and Twitter, in particular—played an essential role in triggering a more effective policy response based around social distancing, lockdown, and containment. Second, and contrary to the view that things will go back to normal once the worst of the crisis has passed, the paper argues that, as a direct result of lockdown, the status quo has been shifted across multiple sectors of the economy. Three examples of this shift are introduced, notably the forced experimentation with digital technologies in education and health, the increased use of remote work in many companies, and a reduction in environmentally harmful behavior and decrease in pollution levels. The long-term effects of this ‘reset’ are impossible to predict, but a quick return to the ‘old normal’ seems unlikely. The paper concludes with the suggestion that this reset has created a unique historical opportunity for the reappraisal of regulatory approaches across multiple domains and exposed the need for regulatory models better aligned to a less mediated, more decentralized world. COVID-19 is a global tragedy, but—given that it has happened—it should be used as a learning experience to re-imagine a better, more socially, and environmentally responsible future. © 2020, The Author(s).

This report highlights potential risks faced by their agri-food sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic and outlines the responses and policy actions each member is taking to address threats to food security and prevent hunger. Research Method: Publicly available information was synthesized, and insights from 19 individuals working in agriculture or agri-food-related areas in the public or private sectors or academia in APO member countries were obtained. Findings: Imminent, medium-and long-term food security challenges due to COVID-19 vary among APO member countries. However, through the implementation of key policies, many stress the need for critical agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and safe, quality seeds, to meet seasonal crop calendars. The longer COVID-19 containment measures stay in place, the more challenging the recovery process will be for ensuring smooth food production, accessibility to staple food and nutrition and trade among countries. Originality / Value: Provides consolidated insight into policies and actions taken by APO member economies to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on food security and the agri-food sector. © 2020, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.

It is a potentially fatal disease that is of public health and economy concern globally. In December 2019, COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China furthermore spread worldwide. Research is underway in many countries to develop effective vaccines and drugs for the COVID-19. In Ayurveda, Acharya Charaka explained the concept of an epidemic condition in Janapadodhwansa Adhayay and combating of these diseases is to be done by Panchakarma (five procedures of purification), Rasayana Chikitsa (immune-modulators therapy) and Sadvritta (good conduct). Rasayan dravyas (immunomodulator drugs) of Ayurveda can be used for health promotion, immune-modulation, prevention and reduce disease burden from COVID-19. Drugs such as Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers), Amalaki (Phyllanthus emblica L.), Mulethi (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.), Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus Willd.), Chireta (Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum L.) Punarnava (Boerhaavia diffusa L.) and Pippali (Piper longum L.) For symptom management of COVID-19 like illness Agastya Haritaki, Anutaila, AYUSH-64 can be used. Scientific research on these drugs may reveal the new approach for the prevention and management of COVID-19. The main aim of this article is to review research which has already conducted and currently being carried out on the herbal plant for their immunomodulation property which have a possible application in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. © Niraj & Varsha (2020).

All the governments’ primary focus is to save humanity from this pandemic problem, and they have lockdown almost the entire nation to stop the spread of infection. This lockdown resulted in a considerable impact on the global as well as a local economy that will take a long time to perform with business as usual scenario. However, improvement in the air quality of the cities across the globe has emerged as a key benefit of this lockdown. Therefore, this study aims to assess the overall impact of social and travel lockdown in five megacities of India; Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. The study evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in five criteria pollutants over two time periods, i.e., March–April 2019 and March–April 2020 and 10th–20th March 2020 (before lockdown) and 25th March to 6th April 2020 (during lockdown). The results highlighted a statistically significant decline in all the pollutants in all the megacities except for ozone. It was observed that the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO declined by ~41% (66–39 µg m–3), ~52% (153–73 µg m–3), ~51% (39–19 µg m–3) and ~28% (0.9–0.65 mg m–3) during the lockdown phase in comparison to the before lockdown in Delhi, respectively. Similar decline in pollutant concentration was observed in other megacities as well. Further, the study conducted an expert survey to identify the possible challenges India might face after lockdown is over. All the experts said that reviving the economy will be a big challenge for the government, and it may result in some tradeoff while managing the air quality in the near future due to scarcity of funds, etc. © The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel-data regression models to evaluate the influence of the daily increase in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases during pre-lockdown and lockdown on daily stock returns of 723 listed firms in Vietnam from 30 January to 30 May 2020. Findings: The study confirms the adverse impact of the daily increasing number of COVID-19 cases on stock returns in Vietnam. The study also discloses that the Vietnam stock market before and during the nationwide lockdown performed in opposing ways. Though COVID-19 pre-lockdown had a significant, negative impact on Vietnam's stock returns, the lockdown period had a significant, positive influence on stock performance of the entire market and the different business sectors in Vietnam. The financial sector was hardest hit on the Vietnam stock market during the COVID-19 outbreak. Research limitations/implications: The study indicates investors' confidence and trust in the Vietnam government's decisions to combat COVID-19 and favorable stocks prices were the main reasons that the Vietnam stock market rebounded during and after lockdown. Originality/value: This is the first study to examine the impact of COVID-19 during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods on stock performance in Vietnam, a rapidly developing economy that was successful in controlling the pandemic with a rejuvenated stock market after lockdown. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Converging evidence from the current pandemic, previous outbreaks and controlled experiments indicates that SARS-CoVs are present in wastewater for several days, leading to potential health risks via waterborne and aerosolized wastewater pathways. Conventional wastewater treatment provides only partial removal of SARS-CoVs, thus safe disposal or reuse will depend on the efficacy of final disinfection. This underscores the need for a risk assessment and management framework tailored to SARS-CoV-2 transmission via wastewater, including new tools for environmental surveillance, ensuring adequate disinfection as a component of overall COVID-19 pandemic containment. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

Because of its rapid spread worldwide, it may influence the prognosis of other medical conditions, such as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We report a case of a 58-year female patient admitted with an infero-posterior STEMI on the background of recently positive COVID-19 swab. Reperfusion was attempted through primary PCI but unfortunately failed to restore coronary blood flow due to massive thrombotic burden despite several attempts of balloon dilatation and aspiration thrombectomy. She sadly died later on because of hemodynamic deterioration. This scenario raises concerns about Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETS) which might potentially have propagated inflammation and thrombosis via platelets' aggregation leading to enhanced coagulopathy and massive coronary thrombosis. Therefore, we suggest primary PCI as the first-choice of revascularization in patients with combined COVID-19 and STEMI. Additionally, we emphasize on the importance of using the potent new generation P2Y12 inhibitors along with GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in every STEMI patient with COVID-19 to achieve favorable conditions for primary PCI as well as favorable outcomes after stent implantation. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC. acute myocardial infarction; antithrombotic treatment; neutrophil extracellular traps; primary percutaneous coronary intervention; viral infection  Sport, exercise and COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus [Sport und COVID-19, die krankheit, die von dem SARS-CoV-2-coronavirus verursacht wird] › No health emergency in living memory has ever had greater repercussions for our health, economy and the way we live than the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, commonly referred to as the “coronavirus”. › COVID-19 has many links to sport and exercise: sports events such as the champions league quarter final between Atalanta Bergamo and FC Valencia on the 19.02.2020 have contributed to the virus spread; control measures such as lockdowns and closures of gyms and other sport facilities have altered our exercise behaviours; major sporting events including the Tokio Olympics have been cancelled or postponed; sports and fitness providers such as sports clubs, gyms and swimming pools have been hard hit. › In this review, we will answer five questions in relation to COVID-19 from the perspective of sport and exercise. The questions deal with 1) how SARS-CoV-2 targets ACE2-expressing human cells via its spike protein, 2) the COVID-19 disease caused by it, 3) the COVID-19 pandemic and attempts to control it, 4) how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 and how the immune system is affected by exercise training, 5) advice for exercise during the pandemic for healthy adults, athletes and elderly, and possible control measures to help to return to normal sport and exercise at the end of the pandemic before herd immunity or mass vaccination has been achieved. © 2020, Dynamic Media Sales Verlag.

An online survey was conducted through snowball sampling technique and total 367 people participated in the survey. The results of the study show that COVID-19 cases spiked amid ease of lockdown in the country and the spread of novel coronavirus pandemic has significant socioeconomic impact on the lives of mountain communities in Gilgit-Baltistan. Financial uncertainty, decrease in income, fear of job loss, and food insecurity are some major challenges that mountain communities face due to outbreak of coronavirus in the region. The results further show that lack of community cooperation with government agencies, lack of awareness about the severity of coronavirus, and insufficient COVID-19 testing kits are the major factors that caused the spread of coronavirus cases. This study suggests that the short-, medium-, and long-term policies are required to mitigate the consequences of this pandemic and to revitalize the mountain economy of Gilgit-Baltistan, and in this regard, this study provides baseline information for policy-makers and practitioners to devise such demanding policies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Comparative strategic approaches to COVID-19 in Africa: Balancing public interest with civil liberties As COVID-19 spreads rapidly across Africa, causing havoc to economies and disruption to already fragile healthcare systems, it is becoming clear that despite standardised global health strategies, national and local government responses must be tailored to their individual settings. Some African countries have adopted stringent measures such as national lockdown, quarantine or isolation, in combination with good hand hygiene, mandatory wearing of masks and physical distancing, to prevent an impending healthcare crisis. The impact of stringent measures in low- to middle-income African countries has bought time for healthcare facilities to prepare for the onslaught of COVID-19 cases, but some measures have been challenging to implement. In some settings, public health measures have been associated with serious violations of individual rights owing to abuse of power and gaps in implementation of well-intentioned policy. Collateral damage with regard to non-COVID-19 diseases that were suboptimally managed in pre-pandemic times may mean that lives lost from other diseases could exceed those saved from COVID-19. While individuals complying with lockdown regulations have embraced an acceptance of the concept of the common good, at a broad community level many are finding the transition from individualism to collective thinking required during a pandemic difficult to navigate. In this article, we look at government responses to the pandemic in six African countries (Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Botswana), and highlight ethical concerns arising in these contexts. © 2020 South African Medical Association.

Disparities result in a disproportionately higher prevalence of disease or lower standard of care provided to the index group. Multiple theories exist regarding the genesis of this disturbing finding. The COVID-19 pandemic has had the unfortunate effect of amplifying health inequity in vulnerable populations. African Americans, who make up approximately 12% of the US population are reportedly being diagnosed with COVID-19 and dying at disproportionately higher rates. Viewed holistically, multiple factors are contributing to the perfect storm: 1) Limited availability of public testing, 2) A dramatic increase in low wage worker unemployment/health insurance loss especially in the service sector of the economy, 3) High rates of preexisting chronic disease states/reduced access to early healthcare and 4) Individual provider and structural healthcare system bias. Indeed, COVID-19 represents a pandemic superimposed on a historic epidemic of racial health inequity and healthcare disparities. Therapeutic solutions are not expected in the near term. Thus, identifying the genesis and magnitude of COVID-19's impact on African American communities is the requisite first step toward crafting an immediate well designed response. The mid and long term approach should incorporate population health based tactics and strategies. © 2020 National Medical Association   COVID-19: Clouds Over the Antimicrobial Resistance Landscape In recent years, the increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been recognized as a real threat to human and animal health. It is a problem that has been given the highest priority, uniting nations in the fight against its causes and effects. Among the actions that have been implemented are: clinical and microbiological surveillance, promotion of rational and controlled use of antibiotics, AMR stewardship programs in hospitals, development of tools for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases to establish prompt and adequate treatment, and radically improving vaccination strategies. The current COVID-19 pandemic has placed disproportionate demands on the healthcare infrastructure and economy worldwide, which will negatively impact on the availability of materials as well as the technical capacity for diagnosis, patient care, and treatment of both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Disruptions to production and distribution chains will hamper the availability and usage of antibiotics, also interrupting several of the activities that have been implemented thus far to combat AMR, including detailed laboratory monitoring and reinforced vaccination programs. Here, we discuss the main aspects that should be considered with regard to AMR, that may be affected by the pandemic and propose some actions to counter them. © 2020 IMSS Anti-bacterial agents; Antimicrobial stewardship; Coronavirus pandemic; Drug resistance; Microbial  Status and situation of postgraduate medical students in China under the influence of COVID-19 At the beginning of 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China has brought great impact on the society, economy and life.

International travel bans in March 2020 dampened viral spread and resulted in an overnight global economic crisis. As countries ease travel and social distancing restrictions, viral resurgences are expected. This study was carried out in order to delineate the development of a second wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths due to lockdown easements in June–July 2020. Methods: Publically available data for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to September 2020 was obtained from “Our World In Data” website and analysed with Pearson correlation. Results: At global level, both datasets exhibited three distinct time periods. Cases rose to mid-April, plateaued till mid-May then rose again. Almost all of the slopes in these three time periods were statistically significant. Deaths followed a similar three-part pattern, albeit more pronounced, with values lagging circa one week after new cases and a middle time period when numbers (of deaths) actually decreased, with all periods exhibiting significant slopes. At continent level, for new cases, Asia rose steadily, Europe is increasing again, the Americas and Africa are declining. Deaths follow a similar pattern. Oceania shows a bimodal pattern, with a first and second wave of cases shortly followed by deaths in a similar pattern. The monthly ratio of detected cases to deaths (case fatality ratio) initially rose to 0.08, then fell to 0.02. Conclusion: The world is in its second wave of COVID-19, with fortunately reduced case fatality ratios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Using topic modeling on over 1,100 open reports from a survey fielded during the first four weeks of the lockdown in Germany, we shed light on how personal experiences of the lockdown differ between women and men. Our results show that, in general, people were most concerned about social contacts and childcare. However, we find clear differences among genders: women worried more about childcare while men were more concerned about paid work and the economy. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting women more heavily than men not only at the physical level of work (e.g. women are reducing more paid work hours than men), but also through increasing the division regarding the cognitive level of work (e.g. women are more worried about childcare work while men are about paid work). These developments can potentially contribute to a future widening of the gender wage gap during the recovery process. © 2020 European Sociological Association. cognitive labor; Corona; gender; Germany; pandemic; topic models  A systematic assessment on COVID-19 preparedness and transition strategy in Bangladesh Rationale, aims, and objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has overpowered the most advanced health systems worldwide with thousands of daily deaths. The current study conducted a situation analysis on the pandemic preparedness of Bangladesh and provided recommendations on the transition to the new reality and gradual restoration of normalcy. Method: A complex adaptive system (CAS) framework was theorized based on four structural dimensions obtained from the crisis and complexity theory to help evaluate the health system of Bangladesh. Data sourced from published reports from the government, non-governmental organizations, and mainstream media up to June 15, 2020 were used to conduct a qualitative analysis and visualize the spatial distribution of countrywide COVID-19 cases. Results: The findings suggested that Bangladesh severely lacked the preparedness to tackle the spread of COVID-19 with both short- and long-term implications for health, the economy, and good governance. Absence of planning and coordination, disproportionate resource allocations, challenged infrastructure, adherence to bureaucratic delay, lack of synchronized risk communication, failing leadership of concerned authorities, and incoherent decision-making have led to a precarious situation that will have dire ramifications causing many uncertainties in the coming days. Conclusions: Implementation of response protocols addressing the needs of the community and the stakeholders from the central level is urgently needed. The development of mechanisms for dynamic decision-making based on regular feedback and long-term planning for a smooth transition between the new reality and normalcy should also be urgently addressed in Bangladesh. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd complexity theory; crisis theory; health system; LMIC; pandemic; SARS-COV-2; situational assessment  The Science Underlying COVID-19: Implications for the Cardiovascular System The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and economy worldwide on an unprecedented scale. Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S-spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor for internalization, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVID-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced angiotensin converting enzyme 2 downregulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heighten angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as elderly adults and those with cardiovascular risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis-like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multiorgan failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, in particular, in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as interleukin-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration, and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and thrombosis remain important.

Worldwide, countries are in dire dilemma of safeguarding the health of their citizens and equally salvaging economy, arising from the social distancing and lockdown strategies, which affects negatively the economic activities. This paper examines the intricate balance between health and the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the policy options needed to assist countries to implement strategies to protect the health of their citizens and promote economic recovery in this unprecedented global crisis situation. There is need for a coordinated public-private sector partnership in the recovery plan of each country, taking into account their contextual and country specific health system and economy, but not discarding the universal application thereof. Global, regional, national geo-political and public health collaboration is needed to save the world from COVID-19 catastrophic consequences. © 2020, Professional Medical Publications.

Effectively stimulating consumption has become a momentous mission in responding to the impact of the epidemic. The popularity of mobile shopping makes shopping behavior no longer limited by time and space, so impulse purchase is more commonly seen nowadays; it can effectively promote residents’ consumption. However, consensus has not been reached regarding how impulse purchase emerges as a phenomenon, thus making it difficult to promote consumers’ purchase behavior. This article aims to explore the generation process of consumers’ impulsive purchase intention during the COVID-19 outbreak from the perspective of system users. For this purpose, the research proposes three mobile situation factors: personalized recommendation, visual appeal, and system usability. They have a positive impact on impulse purchase intention by influencing perceived arousal and perceived enjoyment. The experimental method is used for data collection and hypothesis testing. All the hypotheses are supported. And the theoretical value of the model of “mobile environment stimulation-consumer emotion-impulse purchase intention” is confirmed. Based on the conclusion, management suggestions are proposed for mobile shopping merchants from the perspective of improving consumers’ shopping experience and expanding marketing. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

This paper presents the significant cluster events, relevant developments of innovation, and economical impact in Korea that could inform policy makers on how to respond to health crises in the future. Methods: Health care, economy, epidemiological data are collected from various sources including the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) or other government sources. Results: The KCDC jointly with medical professionals developed a series of innovations such as 1) Full contact tracing and rapid testing with a 12 h turnaround and 10 min movement tracking systems, 2) transparent disclosure of all contract tracing data to the public through a central database, 3) Drive-Through and Walk-Through testing methods, and 4) a 4 tier patient severity index and community treatment isolation centers. Korea moved from the 4th in the world for total confirmed cases in March down to 76th in August. Conclusions: Expedited enforcement of amended legislation acts to protect the healthcare workforce resulted in only 10 healthcare professionals contracting the virus while caring for Covid-19 patients. This has resulted in minimal human capital loss and the government was able to re-direct existing medical workforce to areas in need. The quarantine strategies implemented resulted in little need to lock down the whole economy but also limited the cost spent to gain a year of life to 193,848 Won (US$163). © 2020   How COVID 19 effect Malaysian paddy industry? Adoption of green fertilizer a potential resolution The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more than 4.3 million confirmed cases and more than 2,90,000 deaths worldwide. It has also given rise to fears of an imminent economic crisis and recession. Social distance, self-isolation, and travel restrictions have led to a reduction in the workforce across all economical sectors and have led to a loss of many jobs. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured goods has decreased. On the other hand, the need for medical supplies has increased significantly. The food sector is also facing increased demand as a result of panic buying and storing food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on the various aspects of the world economy. In Malaysia, the COVID-19 epidemic has checked the resilience of the agriculture sector. Especially the Malaysian paddy industry as country imports 30% of its overall consumption from different parts of the world. The real price of rice triplicating for the consumers, which was alarming for nations in this pandemic situation. The Government of Malaysia introduced the National Agrofood Policy 2011–2020 (NAP4) in 2010 as a guidance document for the implementation of agricultural sector development programs and projects in Malaysia. The NAP4 ‘s 10-year term is to be finished by the end of 2020. Several sectors demonstrate substantial success after approximately 8 years of introduction, while the other classes often lag behind the goal and progress quite slowly. Agricultural sector performance is affected by many problems and challenges. In acknowledgment of the poor success of this field, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Based Industry has launched new approaches, policies, and programs that can change the agricultural sector more rapidly. The new direction is aimed at ensuring national food security and boosting farm and revenues. The authorized government agency needs to revise the policy formulation where Malaysia needs to set stages to revolutionize and modernize the rice farming to address the problem faced by the paddy sector in this pandemic situation to adopt GF. In this study, the researcher focuses on the improvisation of the policy to increase the paddy production sustainably. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The subsequent COVID-19 pandemic rapidly affected the health and economy of the world. The global approach to the pandemic was to isolate populations to reduce the spread of this deadly virus while vaccines began to be developed. In March 2020, the first phase I clinical trial of a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine, mRNA-1273, which encodes the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, began in the United States (US). The production of mRNA-based vaccines is a promising recent development in the production of vaccines. However, there remain significant challenges in the development and testing of vaccines as rapidly as possible to control COVID-19, which requires international collaboration. This review aims to describe the background to the rationale for the development of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and the current status of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. © Med Sci Monit, Clinical Trial; COVID-19; Messenger; Pandemics; RNA; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Vaccines coronavirus spike glycoprotein; COVID-19 vaccine; messenger RNA; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus RNA; virus vaccine; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; genetics; human; immunology; pandemic; United States; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Viral; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; United States; Viral Vaccines Covid-19: U3A students’ report on the impacts of social isolation on physical and mental health and access to information about the virus during the pandemic Covid-19 is a global public health crisis, which in addition to making victims is changing the living habits of the population. The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of social isolation on the physical and mental health of older adults and to learn how they are informing themselves about the pandemic. It is a qualitative study with a phenomenological basis, composed by telephone interviews with 35 older adults (70,5 ± 4,7 years) of both genders, members of a Brazilian University of Third Age, during the period of the pandemic. The testimonies revealed a considerable degree of concern about the possibility of being infected by the virus, increased anxiety due to tragic news, the growing number of deaths, the collapse of the Brazilian economy and the rising unemployment rate. The group reported sleep disorders, joint pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, and reduced functional capacity. Everyone felt sufficiently informed about Covid-19. The main means of gaining information about the pandemic was radio, followed by TV, dialogue with family and friends, and WhatsApp. Only 30% of the participants used WhatsApp, praised because of its multiple functions and the ability to re-read the news. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.   Effects of covid-19 pandemic on health and wellbeing of older people: A comprehensive review The pandemic is unavoidable; in addition to increased morbidity and mortality, they profoundly affect people and economies at every level. The negative effects of pandemics are more severe in marginalized populations such as older adults who have higher risks of acquiring infection, more disease-related complications, and increased risks of death. Furthermore, older people are affected by policy decisions and containment measures taken during pandemics. With rapid patient turnover and overwhelmed health care facilities, this older population may not receive proper medical care. In addition to poor clinical outcomes, such measures have profound negative effects on the mental health of older populations. © 2020 by The Korean Geriatrics Society.

The threat of contagious infectious diseases is constantly evolving as demographic explosion, travel globalization, and changes in human lifestyle increase the risk of spreading pathogens, leading to accelerated changes in disease landscape. Of particular interest is the aftermath of superimposing viral epidemics (especially SARS-CoV-2) over long-standing diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant disease for public health worldwide and especially in emerging economies. Methods and Results. The PubMed electronic database was systematically searched for relevant articles linking TB, influenza, and SARS-CoV viruses and subsequently assessed eligibility according to inclusion criteria. Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (focusing on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? Discussions. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from past outbreaks (other coronaviruses) and influenza pandemic/seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection. Conclusions. Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their lethal synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution. Despite the rapidly growing number of cases, the data needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with latent TB and TB sequelae still lies ahead. The trial is registered with NCT04327206, NCT01829490, and NCT04121494. © 2020 Radu Crisan-Dabija et al.

How and when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether SARS-CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means of a spatio-temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per capita and presence of mass transit systems in the province; in contrast, population density and percentage of older adults display negative associations with incidence of COVID-19. © 2020 The Ohio State University   Multilingual communication experiences of international students during the COVID-19 Pandemic While an increasing literature on multilingualism addresses the key role of language in access to social resources, including crisis communication, little attention has been paid to practices of English-mediated multilingualism. Based on semi-structured interviews with 10 international students from South Asia and Southeast Asia receiving their higher education in China, the study reveals what language-related challenges international students encounter, how they mobilize their multilingual resources to enhance their access to crisis communication and build a shared community, and how their multilingual competences are valorized and enacted in the shifting paradigm of the China-oriented new economy addressing mutual accountability in South-South cooperation. The study suggests that English-mediated multilingualism in China fails to bridge the needs of international students of diverse backgrounds. The study also calls attention to the shifting paradigm of multilingual studies and the necessity of addressing the real world problems of health communication in a diverse context. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

In this interim, due to the impacts of this pandemic, startups are more prone to fail or succeed faster than ever before; however, the challenges they face are not yet clearly scrutinized, as the pandemic was faster than scholars. This study therefore investigates the main challenges of Iranian startups by interviewing the co-founders of fifteen well-known startups. The findings are analyzed through two-step coding, and findings were discussed in a focus group session to which startup co-founders, policymakers, and scholars were invited. It was revealed that there are six principal types of challenges to be addressed, including financial, human resources management, support measures and mechanisms, marketing, crisis management, as well as some others. © 2020 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat. challenges; COVID-19; Iran; Pandemic; startups  “I’m not against online teaching, but what about us?”: ICT in Ghana post Covid-19 Globally, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is regarded as a dependable vehicle for facilitating educational reform and development, a platform for communication, and as a means to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal Four (SDG 4). Since the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) and declaration of the SDG 4, many countries have opted to embrace the lifelong education for all by integrating ICT in teaching and learning at all school levels. The Ghanaian Government’s initiative to ensure “education anytime anywhere for everyone” by revolutionizing teaching and learning through ICT has faced a lot of challenges and criticisms. The main mission of the Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) in 2003 was to transform Ghana into an information and technology-driven high-income economy through education, but this goal is yet to be realized. In the wake of the COVID-19 which has forced many countries and educational sectors to adopt online learning, there is a need to discuss the effectiveness of online learning and barriers to online learning in the developing contexts, and how to successfully integrate ICT in schools for online learning, especially rural schools where students’ educational careers are in jeopardy because they benefit less from online learning. The paper identifies critical factors that affect online learning, recommends post COVID-19 strategies to promote e-learning for policymakers in education and the government, and concludes with a conceptual model for emergency transition to e-learning. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Impact of nutrition interventions on the outcomes have been scientifically assessed and reported. The role of nutrition in limiting the infection related morbidity and mortality does not appear to be a debatable question but nutrition interventions do not appear to be an essential part of current COVID-19 management strategies. Given the nature of pandemic and lack of organism-specific evidence, variability in nutrition interventions and lack of nutrition interventions is not unexpected. However, delay in realization of the crucial need of nutrition interventions to limit the immediate and long term outcomes at personal and community level may aggravate health related issues that can have long term impact on quality of life and economy. Due to existing undernutrition and lack of nutrition related awareness and competence, need for timely and appropriate interventions is much more critical for developing countries. This manuscript highlights the need and feasibility of various nutrition interventions to assure optimum quality of life during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Available evidence provides enough guidance for nutrition interventions that are safe and promise to accrue various degrees of benefits with almost no likelihood of harm. Nutrition interventions suggested by author are: 1) population level efforts for promoting better use of existing resources; 2) quicker augmentation of nutrition status of high risk people and non-hospitalized cases by use of supplement and individualized guidance and 3) nutritional support of sever case by timely and adequate enteral and parenteral feeding. © 2020, Professional Medical Publications.

What is not known about the virus is part of the problem, and the knowledge gap drives an unprecedented and urgent search for knowledge. This article explores the challenges for lifelong learning and the relevance of transformative learning. Disorientation, disorienting dilemmas and critical reflection are the ingredients of such learning, since we can only learn our way out of this situation. The authors present American adult educator Jack Mezirow’s theory of transformative learning (TL) as an appropriate learning framework for lifelong learning. They draw on the work of American philosopher Richard Rorty and German philosopher and sociologist Jürgen Habermas to re-shape TL so that it supports the kind of learning that is sufficiently complex and nuanced to enable us to deal with contradictions, ambivalence and meaning-making in a world where not-knowing is the new normal. © 2020, The Author(s). disorienting dilemmas; Habermas; Rorty; transformation theory  A highly specific and sensitive serological assay detects SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in COVID-19 patients that correlate with neutralization Objective: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic challenges national health systems and the global economy. Monitoring of infection rates and seroprevalence can guide public health measures to combat the pandemic. This depends on reliable tests on active and former infections. Here, we set out to develop and validate a specific and sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Methods: In our ELISA, we used SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a stabilized version of the spike (S) ectodomain as antigens. We assessed sera from patients infected with seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and controls. We determined and monitored IgM-, IgA- and IgG-antibody responses towards these antigens. In addition, for a panel of 22 sera, virus neutralization and ELISA parameters were measured and correlated. Results: The RBD-based ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2-directed antibodies, did not cross-react with seasonal coronavirus antibodies and correlated with virus neutralization (R2 = 0.89). Seroconversion started at 5 days after symptom onset and led to robust antibody levels at 10 days after symptom onset. We demonstrate high specificity (99.3%; N = 1000) and sensitivity (92% for IgA, 96% for IgG and 98% for IgM; &gt; 10 days after PCR-proven infection; N = 53) in serum. Conclusions: With the described RBD-based ELISA protocol, we provide a reliable test for seroepidemiological surveys. Due to high specificity and strong correlation with virus neutralization, the RBD ELISA holds great potential to become a preferred tool to assess thresholds of protective immunity after infection and vaccination. © 2020, The Author(s).

Since its early appearance in China Wuhan city, many countries undertook several strict regulations including lockdowns and social distancing measures. Unfortunately, these procedures have badly impacted the world economy. Detecting and isolating positive/probable virus infected cases using a tree tracking mechanism constitutes a backbone for containing and resisting such fast spreading disease. For helping this hard effort, this research presents an innovative case study based on big data processing techniques to build a complete tracking system able to identify the central areas of infected/suspected people, and the new suspected cases using health records integration with mobile stations spatio-temporal data logs. The main idea is to identify the positive cases historical movements by tracking their phone location for the last 14 days (i.e., the virus incubation period). Then, by acquiring the citizen’s mobile phone locations for the same period, the system will be able to measure the Euclidean distances between positive case locations and other nearby people to identify the in-contact suspected-cases using parallel clustering and classification techniques. Moreover, the daily change of the clusters size and its centroids will be used to predict new regions of infection, as well as, new cases. Moreover, this approach will support infection avoidance by alerting people approaching areas of high probability of infection using their mobile GPS location. This case study has been developed as a simulation system consisting of three components; positive cases/citizens movement’s data generation subsystem, big data processing platform including CPU/GPU tasks, and data visualization/map geotagging subsystem. The processing of such a big data system requires intensive computing tasks. Therefore, GPU tasks carried out to achieve high performance and accelerate the data processing. According to the simulated system results, data partitioning and processing speed up measures have been examined. © 2020 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

The COVID-19 outbreak has quickly spread globally and now is having remarkable effects on public health and national economies. Purpose: Effective measures for prevention and control of nosocomial infection are urgently needed to control COVID-19 infection among medical staff. Methods: Herein, we described COVID-19 prevention and control strategies that have been implemented in a tertiary hospital in the middle east of China. Hospital layout was adjusted to prevent and control transmission. Other procedures were then implemented to prevent the spread of the virus, including specialized training and evaluation of medical staff, pre-testing and triage, measures to promote early identification of patients, environmental cleaning and disinfection, new medical waste processing procedures, new patient management procedures, timely disinfection of potential sources of nosocomial infection, and strict protective measures. Results: Since the new measures were implemented, to date there have only been three new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, no cases of medical staff infection, and no COVID19-related deaths at the hospital. Conclusion: The current report provides a protocol that could be implemented in medical departments in similar cities worldwide. © 2020 Kong and Yan.

[La Covid-19 va changer le système agroalimentaire – mais comment?] [Covid-19 wird das Agrar- und Lebensmittelsystem verändern – aber wie?] The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities in the agri-food system and wider society. The elderly, in particular, have been overrepresented in intensive care units. The resulting economic crisis and accelerating geopolitical shifts will change the agri-food system, but it is unclear how this will play out in detail. Two factors are important to consider: will societal priorities change and will the state become more interventionist? We examine these uncertainties via four scenarios from a Dutch perspective. ‘Business as usual’ is realistic if the crises are short and manageable. ‘Government Control’ is more state interventionist, after several decades of neo-liberalism, with a greater focus on the economy and employment as the agri-food system is confronted with a long recession. ‘Regional Communities’ is where there is a long period of echo-pandemics, in which a flourishing community spirit, the attention to nature and a healthy living environment with healthy food are permanent and short supply chains and multifunctional agriculture gain ground. In ‘Green High-Tech Transformation’, the most extreme scenario, the state and technical innovation take on a much larger role in society and our views on our lifestyle change. These trends reinforce each other and the government is tasked with creating a new economy. The scenarios are not predictions but can be used to structure thought and discussion on the way forward. © 2020 The Authors.

However, recent published literature places too little emphasis on the economy and economic environments and instead focuses on explanations rooted within individuals and families. In this article, we review research on families’ financial stress and well-being published in JFEI between 2010 and 2019, which analyzed data collected during the Great Recession and were subsequently published in the shadow of the economic downturn. We discuss the economy and economic environments as gaps in the literature and encourage future research to focus on these explanations of stress and well-being, especially in response to the pandemic recession. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

It has been recently declared as a global pandemic. All the health care professionals must be aware of the disease entity and take precautionary measures to control its transmission from person to person, particularly in hospital settings. In this article, we propose essential steps that can be implemented at the departmental and institutional levels to do endoscopic diagnostic procedures effectively during COVID-19 outbreak and to break the transmission chain. © 2020, Association of Otolaryngologists of India.

Probably the COVID-19 contagion is the most adverse global public health, economic, social, and technological stress since the Second World War. It affects almost all countries and challenges the globalisation particularly the global supply chain. The research community struggles with the multidimensional consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. The critical goal is to quickly implement an efficient vaccine, as the society faces a tradeoff between death exposure and the size of the economic downturn. With this paper, we search for factors affecting contagion, mortality, and the time span between the country virus inception and first death. Additionally, we analyse the development of social media and financial markets. We applied a panel data set on all of the countries across the globe from 31 December 2019 until 31 March 2020 to investigate the patterns of epidemic development. We examined 7,642 country-daily data. We constructed classification tree regression, panel, and cross-sectional regression models. Our results support the conclusion that: 1) the speed of severity and contagion is different between themselves and across continents, 2) financial markets and social media respond differently to factors affecting contagion and severity, and 3) the time span between the first contagion in the economy and first death case cannot be plausibly explained with time-invariant variables. This research supports the policymakers with robust data for the informative allocation of scarce resources. © 2013 IEEE.

This research is a case study based on a Muslim small community in Ciamis-West Java-Indonesia. Data is collected through interviews, observations, and text reviews. The results showed that the response of Muslims to the COVID-19 outbreak was different. Muslim responses to this virus can be categorized into at least five typologies. The five typologies are irrational-passive, irrational-activehater, semi-rational-supportive, rational-diffident, and rational-active-supportive. These five categories are influenced by educational background, social life, culture, economy, religious understanding, and religious commitment. © 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

In response, governments have made available temporary financial support, but not to those tourist enterprises and workers in the undeclared economy. Reporting a 2019 Eurobarometer survey, this paper reveals that one in 165 European citizens engage in undeclared work in tourism and the groups involved. To bring these enterprises and workers onto the radar of the state, a voluntary disclosure initiative is advocated offering access to the temporary financial support for undeclared enterprises and workers disclosing their previous undeclared work. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd coronavirus; COVID-19; informal economy; public policy; tax evasion; tourism industry  Generalising the political economy of structural change: A Structural Political Economy approach The paper builds on the classical understanding of the interplay between material processes and political conflicts, but generalises it in several key respects. This approach does not assume relevant political-economic aggregations ex ante (such as industries or ‘classes’); rather, it explores different possible ways of aggregating social groups and defining their interests depending on the situation under investigation. Moreover, interdependencies in the economy impose the need to keep conflicts within boundaries that are compatible with the viability of the system. Because sectors and groups can be aggregated in different ways, dynamics also depends on how actors represent the system and their position therein, and hence what they understand their interest to be. Different representations give rise to different definitions of competing interests and viability requirements, which in turn generate different endogenous dynamics of the political-economic system. The approach is illustrated through the examples of the Eurozone crisis and Covid-19 crisis. © 2020 Eurozone; Political economy of structural change; Special interest groups; Structural Political Economy; Systemic interest  Harnessing Kenya’s Blue Economy: prospects and challenges Kenya enjoys a marine coastline of about 640 km giving a total area of territorial waters of 9700 km2 while the EEZ is 142,400 km2. She further lays claim to an extended EEZ of approximately 103,320 km2 and has 13,600 km2 of inland waters. The government recognizes the potential of this maritime resource to boost the country’s economic outlook and has made Blue Economy (BE) part of the economic pillar in its development blueprint. For effective development of the BE, Kenya needs, among other things, to: build human resource capacity through investing in marine education and training; boost marine scientific research; support the traditional industries of fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, blue biotechnology, ports and shipping; develop BE database; resolve outstanding boundary disputes; and reduce illegal unreported and unregulated fishing. The study posits that Kenya already has sector-wise experiences and assets as demonstrated by the numerous government institutions participating in the BE and is only lacking policy integration, coordination and coherence. © 2020 Indian Ocean Research Group.

The research, with data collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, is relevant to communities concerned with balancing the economic opportunities presented by tourism development with the employment impacts of the industry. Findings suggest that employment trends in the industry are far from stable. Based on US data over a recent 5-year period, it was determined that hospitality employment was significantly more volatile than was the national economy. The industry’s growth, however, significantly outpaced the broad economy. The research considers the implication of these findings, adding to the tourism economics academic literature while providing important insight for communities as they consider tourism as part of their future development plans. © The Author(s) 2020. community development; COVID-19; employment; volatility  Mitigation Interventions in the United States: An Exploratory Investigation of Determinants and Impacts Purpose: To examine the determinants and impacts of implementing the mitigation interventions to combat the COVID-19 disease in the United States during the first 5 weeks of the pandemic. Method: A content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which states enacted these strategies. A proportional hazard model, a multiple-event survival model, and a random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis. Findings: Contradictory to the study hypothesis, states initially with a high COVID-19 prevalence rate enacted mitigation strategies slowly. Three mitigation strategies (nonessential business closure, large-gathering bans, and restaurant/bar limitations) showed positive impacts on reducing cumulative cases, new cases, and death rates across states. Conclusion: Some states may have missed optimal timing to implement mitigations. Swift implementation of mitigations is crucial. Reopening economy by fully lifting mitigation interventions is risky. © The Author(s) 2020.

The various lockdown measures may have devastating impacts on economies and livelihoods. This approach risks undermining public trust in government responses and therefore undermines efforts to promote behaviour change, which is key to the success of social interventions. Important lessons can be drawn from past Ebola outbreaks and the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic on how communities should be central to COVID-19 responses. Communities are complex and only their members can inform public health experts about their lived realities, the community's understanding of the outbreak and what will work locally to reduce transmission. The public should be encouraged to take positive actions to ensure their own health and well-being, rather than made to feel powerless. Communities should be supported to develop their own response plans, community leaders should be recognised as vital assets, community representatives should have equal inclusion in strategic meetings and greater empathy should be built into decision-making processes. © 2020.

The main driving forces of these changes are shown-price and trade wars and sharply increased volatility in world commodity markets, the coronavirus pandemic accompa-nied by an economic recession and a collapse in energy prices. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the coronavirus crisis on the global economy and energy consumption is considered. Various estimates of the impact of this crisis on the development of economic processes and their evolution are shown, and it is concluded that in the conditions of high uncertainty, all these estimates deserve careful consideration. The main uncertainties related to the economic prospects, including the trajectory of the pandemic, the consequences and duration of measures to contain the spread of the virus, strategies for its re-emergence, as well as the form and speed of recovery of people as the pandemic recedes, as well as shape and speed of people recovering as the pandemic is removed, and the uncertainties associated with overcoming the crisis are identified. The analysis of existing forecasts for the development of the economic situation and energy consumption in the current year, made by the World Monetary Fund, the European Commission, the International Energy Agency, the OPEC Secretariat and other organizations is carried out. Special attention is paid to estimates and forecasts of demand for oil and petroleum products in conjunction/connection with the need to accelerate the transition to clean energy in order to mitigate the risks of climate change, successes in the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources, and technological development in general. The forecast of investment in the energy sector of the global economy made by the IEA and the main changes in investment activity due to the crisis caused by the coronavirus are examined in detail. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the possible impact of this crisis on the energy sector of the Russian economy and on the prospects for the development of energy in Russia, especially its oil and gas industry. It is concluded that the global multi-level crisis should finally become the impetus that will force us to take real steps towards overcoming the dependence of the Russian economy on raw materials and forming an innovative economy based on high-tech industrial production. This crisis should become an additional reason for the country's leadership to take all possible measures to accelerate the diversification of the Russian economy, ensure the development of oil and gas chemistry and other industries related to deep processing of natural resources, and accelerate the transition to the rails of re-source-innovative sustainable development. © 2020, Neftyanoe Khozyaistvo.

Lack of effective treatment, coupled with etiology of COVID-19, has resulted in more than 500,000 confirmed deaths at the time of writing, and the global economy is at an unseen unprecedented low level with unknown near-and long-term consequences. Ingavirin has been considered a non-toxic broad-spectrum antiviral with a complex mechanism of action. The molecule was originally designed for the prophylaxis and treatment of flu caused by both Influenza A and B viruses and for the treatment of viral causes of acute respiratory illness. The article hypothesized that the efficiency of given 1H-imidazol-4-yl heterocyclic scaffold-containing compound against SARS-CoV-2 might be connected with its ability to interfere with specific heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (A1, for example). These specific cellular RNA-binding proteins showed affinity to Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid (N) protein, which shared high homology with the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the fact was expressed by a sequence identity of 90.52%. Impairing of the interactions between nuclear ribonucleoproteins and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might result in the inhibition of a viral replication cycle. Additional immunomodulating properties of ingavirin could be favorable for induction of adaptive immunity of host cells. © 2020, Czech Medical Association J.E. Purkyne. All rights reserved.

Weak medical infrastructure and over-reliance on medical aids may eventually predict worse outcomes in Africa. To reverse this trend, Africa must re-evaluate the only area with strategic advantage; phytotherapy. One of the many plants with previous antiviral potency is against RNA viruses is Aframomum melegueta. In this study, one hundred (100) A. melegueta secondary metabolites have been mined and computational evaluated for inhibition of host furin, and SARS-COV-2 targets including 3C-like proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro), 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase (nsp16) and surface glycoprotein/ACE2 receptor interface. Silica-gel column partitioning of A. melegueta fruit/seed resulted in 6 fractions tested against furin activity. Diarylheptanoid (Letestuianin A), phenylpropanoid (4-Cinnamoyl-3-hydroxy-spiro[furan-5,2′-(1′H)-indene]-1′,2,3′(2′H,5H)-trione), flavonoids (Quercetin, Apigenin and Tectochrysin) have been identified as high-binding compounds to SARS-COV-2 targets in a polypharmacology manner. Di-ethyl-ether (IC50 = 0.03 mg/L), acetone (IC50 = 1.564 mg/L), ethyl-acetate (IC50 = 0.382 mg/L) and methanol (IC50 = 0.438 mg/L) fractions demonstrated the best inhibition in kinetic assay while DEF, ASF and MEF completely inhibited furin-recognition sequence containing Ebola virus-pre-glycoprotein. In conclusion, A. melegueta and its secondary metabolites have potential for addressing the therapeutic needs of African population during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Aframomum melegueta; COVID-19; Diarylheptanoid; flavonoids; phenylpropanoid; SARS-COV-2  Globalization dynamics in times of crisis The slowdown in globalization preceded by the 2008–2009 financial crisis and accompanied by stagnation in cross-border flows of goods and investments ignited the scientific debate about globalization shutting down. This paper assesses globalization on the basis of the observed flows of investment, data, population and trade for the period of 1998–2018. To do so, we propose the Index of Globalization (IG) that allowed us to highlight the key trends in the global economic development. Our assessments show that there was a sustained decline in the trade and investment components of globalization. The information flow demonstrates a slowdown in developed economies, but its growth rate remains stably high. The IG dynamics indicates a significant decrease in times of crises. In contrast to the 2008–2009 financial crisis and the outbreak of SARS in 2003, the COVID-19 pandemic has already caused a more considerable reduction in international flows of factors of production and global GDP. The changes in society behavior adopted during the COVID-19 spread are forecast to have long-term consequences. In terms of globalization, the pandemic has positively affected the dynamics of the information flow by increasing volumes of Internet traffic and intensifying the use of communications. The research results demonstrate that in the case of a significant slowdown in the trade, investment and population flows, an increase in the information flow will not have a substantial impact on globalization processes and will be unable to break the overall trend towards a decline in the Index of Globalization. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science.

The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual screening of Selleckchem database was performed through ‘Virtual Work Flow’ (VSW) to find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential for application in COVID-19.

Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2′-O position of the viral nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free energy of–12.83 ± 0.52 kcal/mol. The second best inhibitor, Galuteolin is a natural compound that inhibits tyrosinase enzyme with MM-PBSA binding free energy value of −11.21 ± 0.47 kcal/mol. Detailed ligand and protein interactions were analyzed and common residues across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV were identified. We propose Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and Galuteolin as the potential inhibitors of NSP16. The results in this study can be used for the treatment of COVID-19 and can also form the basis of rational drug design against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. coronavirus; COVID-19; docking; drug repurposing; MD simulation; virtual screening  Panic in the Streets—Pandemic and Protests: A Manifestation of a Failure to Achieve Democratic Ideals America is at a critical crossroads in history as the COVID-19 pandemic expands. We argue that the failure to respond effectively to the pandemic stems from the nation’s protracted divergence from the democratic ideals, we purport to value. Structural racism and class-based political and economic inequity are sustained through the failings of the nation’s democratic institutions and processes. The situation has, in turn, fostered further inequity and undermined science, facts, and evidence in the name of economic and political interests, which in turn has encouraged the spread of the pandemic, exacerbated health disparities, and escalated citizen tensions. We present a broad vision of reforms needed to achieve democratic ideals which we believe is the most important first step to achieving true political representation, achieving a resilient and sustainable economy, and fostering the health of vulnerable communities, workers, and the planet. © The Author(s) 2020.

This represents a very significant challenge for tourism as a growth system. Much attention has been paid to different tourism subsectors such as aviation, accommodation, and activities to reduce emissions, mostly on the basis of (future) technology. However, the Paris Agreement demands immediate action and significant year-on-year progress on a zero-carbon trajectory. This article discusses destination management under the new low-carbon imperative. It analyses challenges, including economic viability and resilience, that have also gained importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and explores opportunities for better profitability on the basis of a leakage/spending value dichotomy proposition. The final section highlights the foremost role that destination managers must play in building prosperous and resilient low-carbon tourism destination systems and discusses the key insights for destination managers. © The Author(s) 2020. carbon management; climate change; COVID-19; destination management; resilience; value generation  Reconstructing tourism in the Caribbean: connecting pandemic recovery, climate resilience and sustainable tourism through mobility justice Caribbean islands that are highly dependent on tourism are facing compounding crises from climate-related disasters to the Covid-19 pandemic travel disruption. The rebuilding of tourism infrastructure has often been one of the main aims of international development aid and regional government responses to natural disasters. This article seeks to identify other ways in which Caribbean small island states and non-independent territories might rebuild more sustainable ecologies and economies as they come out of the pandemic within the ongoing climate crisis. The first part shows the historical grounding of climate change vulnerability in colonial histories, neoliberal capitalism and ongoing practices of “extractive” tourism. This analysis of the “coloniality of climate” centers on a critique of disaster tourism during these “unnatural disasters,” and allows for re-framing the ethical and political implications of tourism recovery when other human im/mobilities (such as migration) are severely curtailed. The article then elaborates on the theoretical concept of “mobility justice” as a way to think through the problem of sustainability transitions in relation to tourism mobilities, climate change and disaster recovery. The final section considers alternative visions for disaster reconstruction in the Caribbean centering food sovereignty, agroecology and regenerative economies, as promoted by community-based organizations and people’s assemblies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Purpose: Entrepreneurship, in many low-resilient economies, plays a critical role in overcoming external shocks. Thus, it is crucial in such situation that entrepreneurial firms can survive and even grow so that the whole economy can benefit from a higher level of resilience. The purpose of this study is to understand how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) brings about firms' performance through the moderating role of CEOs' self-transcendence values in the context of a low-resilient sanctioned economy. Design/methodology/approach: This is a quantitative research that employs hierarchical regression analysis of a sample of 114 Iranian entrepreneurial firms composed of 62 knowledge-based and 52 creative firms. Findings: The analysis revealed that in the low-resilient sanctioned economy, Iran, EO-performance link is moderated by the level of CEOs' self-transcendence value, that is, higher level of CEO self-transcendence leads to stronger impact of EO on performance. This moderation is not different in creative sector vs. knowledge-based sector of the economy. Originality/value: This paper addresses a major gap in the traditional EO-performance relationship which is related to the role of CEO values. Also, the context of Iran's low level of economic resilience adds more novelty to this study, emphasizing on the role of CEO personal values of self-transcendence in times of crisis. The results could also be generalized in many economies now facing the COVID-19 pandemic crisis during which CEOs' self-transcendence values are vitally important in overcoming the difficulties of doing business in such situation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The viruses have adapted to infect a large number of animal species, ranging from bats to camels. At present, seven CoVs infect humans, of which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe. Healthcare systems around the globe have been stretched beyond their limits posing new challenges to emergency healthcare services and critical care. The outbreak continues to jeopardize human health, social life and economy. All known human CoVs have zoonotic origins. Recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pet, zoo and certain farm animals has highlighted its potential for reverse zoonosis. This scenario is particularly alarming, since these animals could be potential reservoirs for secondary zoonotic infections. In this article, we highlight interspecies SARS-CoV-2 infections and focus on the reverse zoonotic potential of this virus. We also emphasize the importance of potential secondary zoonotic events and the One-Health and One-World approach to tackle such future pandemics. © 2020 The Author(s).

A Dsge Modeling In Small Open Economy This article aims to investigate the relationship between inbound tourism and housing market along with the recent boom in Icelandic real estate sector, in which both house and rental prices have been rising dramatically. To this end, we construct a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model enclosing a tourism sector and a housing market with owner-occupied and rental sections. The simulation results unveil a transmission channel that indicates the higher inbound tourism demand raises both house prices and rental prices. Variance decomposition and historical decomposition show that both inbound tourism demand shock and manufacturing technology shock are the key driving forces of the fluctuations of Icelandic house prices, consumption, and investment, whereas housing preference shock plays the most important role in determining the volatility of rental prices. The policy implications indicate that any shocks to tourism could easily spillover to housing market dynamics and aggregate fluctuations. © The Author(s) 2020.

Simultaneous with the rise of trade protectionism in the twenty-first century has been a resurgence in nationalist politics, most notably in the USA, the UK, and parts of the EU. These developments in international and US trade policy, including Washington’s launch of a full-fledged trade war against China in March 2018, have converged disastrously with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in November 2019 and the onset of a worldwide pandemic. Given the status of the USA as the world’s hegemon since 1945, what is new here is the effort of the Trump administration to abdicate US leadership, jettison longstanding alliances, and turn back the clock on the country’s close integration with the world economy. Already, greatly reduced flows of goods, services, and people have translated into radically reduced global growth, widespread business disruptions, and high unemployment. Remarkably, the White House has refused to recognize the severity of the pandemic and has undermined the precautions of the US science community. We argue that these multiple shocks constitute a major critical juncture on par with what the world community faced in 1945. However, in the twenty-first century we have seen that high levels of economic uncertainty and political instability have superseded the long-held notion that international interdependence would pull the world community through tough times such as these. Could the triple whammy of a destructive trade war, deadly pandemic, and secular decline of US leadership trigger a new generation of policy innovation and institution building on par with the post-1945 era? In terms of the global trade regime, it would be difficult to imagine a buoyant recovery of the world economy in the absence of a serious reckoning with the pattern of norm erosion that we identify here. © 2020, Fudan University.

However, these measures are not without cost to the health and economies of the nations in which they are enacted. Nations are now looking for methods to remove physical distancing measures and return to full functioning. To prevent a massive second wave of infections, this must be done with a data-driven methodology. The purpose of this article is to propose an algorithm for coronavirus testing which would allow for physical distancing to be scaled back in a step-wise manner which limits ensuing infections and protects the capacity of the healthcare system.

Efforts towards a COVID-19 vaccine To many scientists and political authorities, the development of a vaccine against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be the way to restore normality to civil life in this time of a devastating pandemic. Expectations for a vaccine are high while the case numbers continue to rise. As of mid-August 2020, more than 20 million people have been infected and more than 760 000 lives have been lost worldwide. The threat of this virus to health, the economy and to society is so great that the wish for a fast track vaccine is understandable, but how realistic is it? This survey article tries to give an overview of vaccine candidates in development, including preclinical and clinical testing, and it mentions some of the societal problems of vaccine acceptance. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Protest potential of the latin america: Regional aspect of global phenomenon The world is showing signs of geopolitical and geo-economical imbalance, which threatens the international com-munity with new crisis shocks. This is indicated by a slowdown in the growth of the world economy and trade, neo-pro-tectionism and increasing sanction measures, financial “hand-wringing” of “undesirable” regimes, the incessant mili-tary actions in Syria, the “frozen”, but with that not less the destructive conflict in Ukraine, and many other dangerous phenomena of international life. More recently, they have been joined by another “black swan” – ​the unexpected event that could critically complicate the economic and political environment, both in individual countries and globally. This is certainly the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the various negative effects of which have yet to be fully assessed. But one thing is already clear: coronavirus will have a negative impact on the world economy, “push” its reversal to the next global crisis and, as a result, the deterioration of the social situation. Similarly, the powerful wave of mass socio-political protests that swept the world (including a number of Latin American states) requires its comprehensive analysis and reflection. In this case, it is necessary to consider this phenomenon in two dimensions: a) the main causes and country features of protests; b) the conditioning of protests by the megatrends of global development, their connection with the fundamental processes that are changing the world order, formed in the age of neoliberal globalization. This dual task is even more relevant, because, according to experts of the consulting company Eurasia Group, in 2020, new protests, particularly in Latin America, can become one of the main global risks. The facts show that the main reason for the protests in the region has been a growing public discontent with the deepening income gap between the ruling class and the vast majority of the population, rampant corruption, the inability of authorities to resolve accumulated socio-economic problems for the greater public good and overcome the stagnation in which Latin American states live. © 2020, Russian Academy of Sciences.

In 2020, due to the crisis and anti-covid-19 measures, the share of SMEs in GDP and employment will significantly decrease. Why is this happening, and is it worth supporting a seemingly insignificant sphere of the economy? The article describes the factors and patterns of entrepreneurship development in Russia and their relations with the regional development. The development of SMEs is negatively affected by uncertainty of the economic situation and decline in demand. High investment risks and a low level of trust narrow the possibilities for productive and opportunity entrepreneurship development. As a result, the share of informal employment and necessity entrepreneurship is high and will grow in Russia, especially in the least developed regions. Although in the pre-crisis years, there was a tendency toward an improvement in formal institutions, an increase in the availability of financing, but not in all regions. Informal institutions and norms change more slowly, they determine low involvement in entrepreneurial activity. A crisis can lead to a reduction in the number of entrepreneurs, which will have a negative long-term effect on sustainable regional development. The sectoral structure of the SME has diversified, and the share of internet services has grown. These processes because of forced digitalization during the epidemic may accelerate, especially in large agglomerations. Direct state support previously had little effect on the SME development due to the lack of awareness and distrust, small scale, so there is doubt that it will be able to radically change the situation in the current period. If the crisis and anti-epidemic measures continue in the summer, the worst negative consequences should be expected in the southern regions, where more than 50% are employed in the entrepreneurial sector, but entrepreneurial ecosystems and digitalization are poorly developed. Our calculations show a potential reduction in the number of small and medium-sized enterprises by 50–60%, which could lead to a decrease in gross regional product by an average of 3–10%. © 2020 New Economic Association.

The primary data for the study were collected through telephonic-based survey of 451 labourers during May–June 2020. The results of this study showed that, on an average, labourers in the study area remained jobless for nearly 2 months and incurred income loss of INR 28,955 thereby failed to send remittances towards their families by an amount of INR 12,215 during the reference period. As per the analysis of covariance the income loss and remittances unsent amount was higher amongst the elderly labourers engaged in professions which remained non-operational during lockdown period. Further, the additional days of joblessness increased their hardship in terms of income and remittances. With coronavirus being more than a health crisis, in short term it is necessary to minimise the loss of life, forwarding social and financial security for the families of migrant labourers and vulnerable sections for extended period of crisis, strategies for supporting agriculture and allied activities, promotion of small and medium-size enterprises, imparting skill training for the unemployed and reverse migrant labourers, financial assistance for self-employment may be helpful. Suitable coordination of monetary and fiscal policy would be helpful for reducing the unemployment heading from the recessionary trend of the economy in the long run. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Men and COVID-19: the aftermath The global pandemic as a result of the SARS-CoV2 virus has seen over 16 m people infected and over 650,000 deaths, with men at double the risk of both developing the severe form of the disease and mortality. There are both biological (sex) and socio-cultural (gender) factors, compounded by socio-economic factors and ethnicity, that impact on the aftermath of what has occurred over the short time that this novel coronavirus has been circulating the world. The potential life-long morbidity as a result of the infection and as a consequence of highly invasive critical care treatment needs to be factored into the rehabilitation of survivors. There are also many men whose lives will have been severely affected both physically and emotionally by the pandemic without ever contracting the disease, with the widespread disruption to normal existence and its impact on their social world and the economy. The implications of the closure of many healthcare services over the initial lockdown will also have both a shorter- and longer-term impact on other diseases due to missed early diagnosis and disrupted treatment regimes. Getting effective public health messages out to the population is critical and this current pandemic is demonstrating that there needs to be a more focused view on men’s health behavior. Without effective public support for preventative action, the more likely the disease will continue its path unabated. This review explores the wider ramifications of the disease both for those men who have survived the disease and those that have been affected by the wider social effects of the pandemic. The pandemic should be a wake-up call for all involved in the planning and delivery of health and social care for the greater attention to the central role of sex and gender. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

To establish the various effects of the coronavirus on the economy and protective equipment, as well as probable transmission channels. Methods. Mathematical, empirical, systemic, analytical, economic and other approaches are used to study the development of the world market in the conditions of the coronavirus disease. Results. We give a brief description of the Kermack–Mac-Kendrick epidemic model, corresponding to the general nature of the current coronavirus epidemic, that can dramatically change the global market development scenario. We show three scenarios for the global economy development. Quick recovery implies a slowdown in economic growth in the United States and Europe will end by the end of March; China is likely to recover by the end of April, and demand will recover relatively quickly. Global slowdown implies the economy will recover at the end of the second quarter, but global GDP growth in 2020 will drop to 1…1.5 percent. Global pandemic implies a serious shock to the global economy, which can last for almost a year. Conclusion. Three scenarios of the world economy development in the context of the coronavirus crisis are formulated, as well as the various effects of the coronavirus disease on the world economy are identified; remedies are proposed. We concluded that the coronavirus disease will affect microeconomic heritage, macroeconomic heritage and political heritage. Multilaterally, the crisis can be interpreted as a call for increased cooperation or, on the contrary, a need to expand the bipolar centers of geopolitical power. We list a number of mathematical papers with extensive bibliography on COVID-19. On the example of one of such works we have shown that the Kermack–Mac-Kendrick model remains the backbone of the research in this sphere. © 2020, Saratov State University. All rights reserved.

We deduce that digital connectedness of individuals and organizations eased sharing of information on the causes and measures aimed at controlling and avoid the rapid spread of the epidemic in developing economies of Africa. We conclude that digital connectedness enabled African countries to access; share and implement globally suggested mechanisms aimed at controlling the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Future, studies should examine how African economies use digital connectedness to increase individual and organizational participation in curbing epidemics and also boost health management. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd   Innovative regional development of the structurally disadvantaged industrial region by means of the local currency Local and community currencies have been used as a stimulating tool to increase trading activities and social interactions of geographically restricted regions. This paper aims to investigate the potential of innovative regional development of the structurally disadvantaged industrial region focused on the steel and mining industry by means of the local currency. Being the important players of local economies and regional development, SMEs have always been in the center of interest for practitioners of the local and community currencies. Therefore, our research team analyzed and explored major benefits and barriers that SMEs perceive to adopt and use local currency. In parallel with the specified aims, the researchers employed the structured questionnaire survey with open and dichotomous questions focused on SMEs with no practical experience with the acceptance and use od the local or community currencies in Cieszyn Silesia region. The results of our research show that SMEs are prone to be active members of local currency communities, and they positively perceive the support that major regional producers, service providers, and practitioners can provide for them through this instrument. Moreover, some SMEs also perceive local currencies as a marketing and promotion tool that increases product-service quality and mutual transactions of firms. According to the respondents, high participation fees and exchange rates, lack of usage by customers and coverage by national currencies, counterfeiting, and fraud, liquidity risk, taxability, accountability, legislative and technical issues, credibility and trustworthiness of practitioners have been main impediments in the adoption and usage of these currencies by SMEs. This research provides innovative solutions and suggestions for policymakers in case of the regional development of the structurally disadvantaged industrial regions to overcome the barriers of local currencies. Since local currencies can be created in digital formats, the increasing importance of local digital currencies in the Covid-19 pandemic has also been highlighted. © 2020 by the authors.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) is responsible for causing this pandemic across different continents. It is not only impacting the world economy but also quarantined millions of people in their homes or hospitals. Purpose: At present, there is no Food and Drug Administration-approved drug or vaccine available to treat this disease. Still, people are trying various pre-existing medicines that are known to have anti-viral or anti-parasitic effects. In view of this, the present study aimed to study the binding potential of various phytochemicals present in multiple natural plant extract as a secondary metabolite to non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15) protein, a drug target known to play a crucial role in virulence of coronavirus. Method: Nsp15 protein was selected because it shows 89% similarity to the other SARS-CoV, which caused the earlier outbreak. The assumption is that inhibition of Nsp15 slowdowns the viral replication. Phytochemicals are selected as these are present in various plant parts (seed, flower, roots, etc.), which are used in different food cuisines in different geographical regions across the globe. The molecular docking approach was performed using two different software, i.e., Autodock, and Swissdock, to study the interaction of various phytochemicals with Nsp15 protein. Hydroxychloroquine is used as a positive control as it is used by medical professionals showing some positive effects in dealing with coronavirus. Results: The present study demonstrated the binding potential of approximately 50 phytochemicals with Nsp15 and capable of inhibiting the viral replication, although in vitro and in vivo tests are required to confirm these findings. Conclusions: In conclusion, the present study successfully demonstrated the binding of phytochemicals such as sarsasapogenin, ursonic acid, curcumin, ajmalicine, novobiocin, silymarin and aranotin, piperine, gingerol, rosmarinic acid, and alpha terpinyl acetate to Nsp15 viral protein and they might play a key role in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Molecular docking; Non-structural protein 15 (Nsp15); Phytochemicals; SARS-CoV-2; Sarsasapogenin  Seeing like a city: how tech became urban The emergence of urban tech economies calls attention to the multidimensional spatiality of ecosystems made up of people and organizations that produce new digital technology. Since the economic crisis of 2008, city governments have aggressively pursued economic growth by nurturing these ecosystems. Elected officials create public-private-nonprofit partnerships to build an “innovation complex” of discursive, organizational, and geographical spaces; they aim not only to jump-start economic growth but to remake the city for a new modernity. But it is difficult to insert tech production space into the complicated urban matrix. Embedded industries and social communities want protection from expanding tech companies and the real estate developers who build for them. City council members, state legislators, and community organizations oppose the city government’s attempts to satisfy Big Tech companies. While the city’s density magnifies conflicts of interest over land-use and labor issues, the covid-19 pandemic raises serious questions about the city’s ability to both oppose Big Tech and keep creating tech jobs. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: This editorial is a review of the main issues discussed in the special journal issue regarding family businesses at the macro, meso and micro level. This approach enables a better understanding about the future research and practical implications for family business in the new economy characterised by substantial changes resulting from the covid-19 pandemic. Findings: The findings suggest that family business studies need to incorporate new industry and societal contexts that have not previously been examined in sufficient detail in family business studies. This includes focusing more on the sport industry that is characterised by many family businesses. Originality/value: This editorial for the special journal issue is amongst the first to discuss the role of the covid-19 crisis in impacting family business. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Most recently, the disappearance of the arts portfolio into a “super-ministry” along with infrastructure, transport, regional development and communications further signals the lack of support, both ideologically through public rhetoric, and financially through (absent) support packages, the current federal government holds towards the arts and arts workers. This paper accounts for how such ideological fractures have underserved freelancers, casuals, temporary and part-time workers in the arts who missed out on the critical initial support packages, and how state governments were more willing to make up for this initial shortfall. This paper further accounts for how the federal government lacks the necessary understanding of working patterns of those engaged in creative occupations, and over emphasizes funding bailouts for primary industry. This also has broader implications for how women are disproportionately impacted by sectors the federal government chooses to support. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. arts funding; Arts policy; Australia; Covid-19; creative workers; work insecurity  Strengthening protected areas to halt biodiversity loss and mitigate pandemic risks The current COVID-19 pandemics is having a major impact on our global health and economies. There is widespread recognition that ecosystem disruption, including land-use change and illegal wildlife trade, is linked to the increasing emergence of zoonotic diseases. Here, we emphasize that protected areas play a fundamental role in buffering against novel disease outbreaks by maintaining ecosystem integrity. However, protected areas worldwide are facing increasing human pressures, which are being amplified by the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. Increased resources are thus urgently needed to mainstream a One Health approach to protected area management, focusing specifically on i) monitoring illegal wildlife trade, ii) biodiversity trends and iii) surveillance of zoonotic pathogens. Improving integration of public healthinto global biodiversity conservation policies should be a top priority to reduce the risk of future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.   Blockchain Technology in Current Agricultural Systems: From Techniques to Applications Increasingly, blockchain technology is attracting significant attentions in various agricultural applications. These applications could satisfy the diverse needs in the ecosystem of agricultural products, e.g., increasing transparency of food safety and IoT based food quality control, provenance traceability, improvement of contract exchanges, and transactions efficiency. As multiple untrusted parties, including small-scale farmers, food processors, logistic companies, distributors and retailers, are involved into the complex farm-to-fork pipeline, it becomes vital to achieve optimal trade-off between efficiency and integrity of the agricultural management systems as required in contexts. In this paper, we provide a survey to study both techniques and applications of blockchain technology used in the agricultural sector. First, the technical elements, including data structure, cryptographic methods, and consensus mechanisms are explained in detail. Secondly, the existing agricultural blockchain applications are categorized and reviewed to demonstrate the use of the blockchain techniques. In addition, the popular platforms and smart contract are provided to show how practitioners use them to develop these agricultural applications. Thirdly, we identify the key challenges in many prospective agricultural systems, and discuss the efforts and potential solutions to tackle these problems. Further, we conduct an improved food supply chain in the post COVID-19 pandemic economy as an illustration to demonstrate an effective use of blockchain technology. © 2013 IEEE. agricultural applications; Blockchain technology; data integrity; food supply chains management; traceability Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Food safety; Food supply; Supply chains; Agricultural management systems; Agricultural sector; Agricultural system; Cryptographic methods; Food processors; Food quality controls; Popular platform; Small scale farmers; Blockchain Whither Presidential Approval? Until recently, presidential job approval has been positively correlated with a healthy economy. Despite pre-COVID-19 sanguine macroeconomic indicators, President Donald Trump's job approval numbers appear to be quite low relative to those of his predecessors. Using a Bayesian model to infer latent presidential approval, we regress approval on consumer sentiment, finding strong evidence of a structural break commencing with the inauguration of President Barack Obama. We also find that the positive associations between presidential approval and consumer sentiment have weakened. Finally, we posit that a polarized political landscape may contribute to the changing of the meaning of presidential approval, which now appears to be a proxy for partisanship. © 2020 Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress   Financial geography II: The impacts of FinTech – Financial sector and centres, regulation and stability, inclusion and governance In this report, I review interdisciplinary research on the actual and potential consequences of FinTech, with emphasis on ideas from and for geographers, and three areas: financial sector and centres, financial regulation and stability, and financial inclusion and governance. I show that the consequences of FinTech are full of controversies, which are part of broader, long-standing debates on the role of finance in economy and society, and need to be approached from geographical perspectives. The intense fusion of fin and tech, arguably accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, complicates and elevates these controversies to a new level. © The Author(s) 2020. financial geography; financial governance; financial inclusion; financial regulation; financial stability; financial technology; FinTech  Strategies to Maximize Available Resources With Minimum Cost Escalation for Improving Radiation Therapy Accessibility in the Post–Coronavirus Disease 2019 Era: An Analysis for Asia Purpose: There is widespread accord among economists that the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will have a severe negative effect on the global economy. Establishing new radiation therapy (RT) infrastructure may be significantly compromised in the post–COVID-19 era. Alternative strategies are needed to improve the existing RT accessibility without significant cost escalation. The outcomes of these approaches on RT availability have been examined for Asia. Methods and Materials: The details of RT infrastructures in 2020 for 51 countries in Asia were obtained from the Directory of Radiotherapy Centers of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Using the International Atomic Energy Agency guidelines, the percent of RT accessibility and the additional requirements of teletherapy (TRT) units were computed for these countries. To maximize the utilization of the existing RT facilities, 5 options were evaluated, namely, hypofractionation RT (HFRT) alone, with/without 25% or 50% additional working hours. The effect of these strategies on the percent of RT access and additional TRT unit requirements to achieve 100% RT access were estimated. Results: In 46 countries, 4617 TRT units are available. The mean percent of RT accessibility is 62.4% in 43 countries (TRT units = 4491) where the information on cancer incidence was also available, and these would need an additional 6474 TRT units for achieving 100% RT accessibility. By adopting HFRT alone, increasing the working hours by 25% alone, 25% with HFRT, 50% alone, and 50% with HFRT, the percent of RT access could improve to 74.9%, 78%, 90.5%, 93.7%, and 106.1%, respectively. Correspondingly, the need for additional TRT units would progressively decrease to 4646, 4284, 3073, 2820, and 1958 units. Conclusions: The economic slowdown in the post–COVID-19 period could severely impend establishment of new RT facilities. Thus, maximal utilization of the available RT infrastructure with minimum additional costs could be possible by adopting HFRT with or without increased working hours to improve the RT coverage. © 2020 The Author(s)   Are global value chains truly global? Are global value chains (GVCs) truly global or are they more of a regional phenomenon? We provide a new perspective on this issue using network analysis based on the measure of trade in value added. We first show that GVC activities can be consistently identified and grouped into three types of networks, i.e. traditional, simple, and complex trade networks, according to the number of times that factor contents cross national borders in global production sharing. Further investigation on the changes in topology and structure of various networks reveals that, GVCs are more likely organized regionally and dominated by large countries, like the US, China, and Germany. However, at the sector level, what GVCs look like largely depends on the perspective (supply or demand) and the type of networks adopted. This can help better understand the possible structural change of GVCs brought by the US–China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020, © 2020 The International Input--Output Association.

Asian science, open data, and knowledge control in global virus surveillance On several occasions, the People’s Republic of China refused to share influenza viruses isolated on their territory with the World Health Organization pandemic flu surveillance system. Scholars in STS and allied disciplines have described these disputes as examples of growing conflict between global health norms of free exchange and Asian state claims of viral sovereignty. However, the discussion has largely over-looked the fact that laboratories in China freely shared genetic sequence data from isolated viruses, even when they refused to ship physical samples, a fact that complicates the opposition of open data and viral sovereignty with the different material forms of the physical sample and the nucleotide sequence. This article provides a comprehensive comparison of the heterogeneous circulations of influenza virus samples and virus gene sequences in global health influenza surveillance and argues this difference is rooted in the different knowledge-control regimes designed for exchanging samples and sequences. Engaging with debates on the position of Asian science within global scientific circulations, the article suggests that Asian scientists confront a multiplicity of global scientific infrastructures and do not necessarily rely on the authority of nation-state sovereignty to reshape global exchanges. © 2020 Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

In Australia, international students made a significant contribution to the country’s economy and its society. However, there is a paucity in theory and of empirical research on the effects of field experience on international preservice teachers (IPSTs). Addressing this gap, the paper contributes to an understanding of the changes to the identities of IPSTs engaged in field experiences. Drawing on a single case study of a group of first-year IPSTs undertaking a non-assessed field experience, the concept of ‘transcultural’ is employed to understand the links between culture, place and identity that the cohort experience in the host education sites. This paper shows the emergence of how IPSTs understand how children learn and its connection with pedagogy as part of them becoming transcultural. While this study occurs before COVID-19, it argues for shared responsibility between universities, education sites and teachers to enable the transcultural meanings to be established within the field experience, thereby creating inclusive conditions central to IPSTs’ contribution to the existing cultural and linguistic diversities in education settings. This is even more vital under the changed circumstances of COVID-19. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. cultural diversity; field experiences; identity; international preservice teachers; teacher education; Transcultural  Multinational enterprises and the governance of sustainability practices in emerging market supply chains: An agile governance perspective Advanced economy multinational enterprises (AMNEs) face idiosyncratic challenges related to the governance of their sustainability practices in their emerging market supply chains. One way for AMNEs to address these challenges would be by adopting agile sustainability governance mechanisms. Drawing on the theories of experimentalist governance and deliberation, we propose a processual framework suited to develop agile sustainability governance mechanisms. We explore the challenges to supplier participation and the factors that enable an authentic dialogue in the process. We contribute to the scholarship on transnational governance and strategic agility, and offer practical implications which are also relevant for disruptions like COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Addressing this challenge, particularly as it pertains to Eurasia, our multinational group of scholars draws on past and ongoing research to suggest a roadmap for a new pandemic politics research subfield. Key research questions include not only how states are responding to the new coronavirus, but also reciprocal interactions between the pandemic and society, political economy, regime type, center-periphery relations, and international security. The Foucauldian concept of “biopolitics” holds out particular promise as a theoretical framework. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.   Economic regulation and E-scooter networks in the USA This paper looks at the challenges in the economic regulation of stand-up electronic scooters, or “e-scooters”. The e-scooter represents one of several innovative modes that have emerged to cater for transportation needs in urban areas. They provide connectivity linking local origins and destinations, as well as interconnectivity linking urban locations to inter-urban networks. These vehicles are marketed as a micro form of public transportation designed to meet the needs of fit and able people wishing to make trips of two miles or less. They are touted as part of “micromobility” complementing existing transportation networks. This paper reviews the gray and limited academic economic literature looking at the viability and economics of e-scooters within the context of the regulatory environment in which they operate in US cities. It considers the ways regulatory structures are evolving as the authorities learn of the attributes and limitations of the mode. In doing this, the paper also makes comparisons with some of the other “novel” forms of local transportation that have emerged, including those offered by transportation network companies. The paper focuses on the pre-Covid-19 period. © 2020 Disruptive innovations; E-scooters; Economic core; Economic regulation; Gig-economy; Nudging; Sharing economy; Technical externalities  Doubling down on austerity: Framing and coronavirus response Even amid a global pandemic, the ideologies, thought processes, and motivations of public actors can be explained through theory, particularly framing. We argue that the words and symbols used or not used are vitally important to shaping how the public understands, responds to, and navigates our new normal. Moreover, this framing shapes our collective understanding of who or what is valued. We posit that austerity politics at all levels of government has not only helped to create a patchwork system of crisis response, but also explains the variation in framing of the pandemic response as tradeoffs among competing values (e.g., equity versus economy; us versus other; health versus business). The success or failure of these frames can lead to an environment in which administrative evil flourishes. © 2020, © 2020 Public Administration Theory Network.

How we navigate these disruptive influences is important for the enjoyment of tourists, the success of tourism service providers and other local people, and the integrity of the natural world. The purpose of this research note is to discuss a surrogate ecotour experience that allows tourists to remain home while employing local guides to facilitate personalised, interactive, real-time tours (PIRTs). It is argued that there is a market for this type of experience for persons with disabilities and the elderly who have accessibility needs, and for the sustainable citizen who wishes to minimise his/her impact on the planet. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. alternative hedonism; COVID-19; disruption; sustainable citizen; Technology  Serological assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), March 2020 Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has major impacts on health systems, the economy and society. Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions. We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making. Aim: Our objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies. Methods: We developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT90) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls. Results: IgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT90 were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls. We found that PRNT90 tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge. Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test. Conclusion: Using IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT90, is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies. © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Although less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, it has taken several lives and taken down the economies of many coun-tries. Before this outbreak, the most recent coronavi-rus outbreaks were the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV outbreaks that happened in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Since, the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, they share several similarities. So, this review aims at un-derstanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses. Studies re-veal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses. The presence of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the S protein priming and might increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other beta coronaviruses. So, furin inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the tensor train decomposition approach is presented as a global convergence algorithm. The idea of the proposed method is to extract the tensor structure of the optimized functional and use it for multidimensional optimization problems. Secondly, for the refinement of the unknown parameters, three local optimization approaches are implemented and compared: Nelder-Mead simplex method, gradient method of minimum errors, adaptive gradient method. For gradient methods, the evident formula for the continuous gradient of the misfit function is obtained. The identification problem for the diffusive logistic mathematical model which can be applied to social sciences (online social networks), economy (spatial Solow model) and epidemiology (coronavirus COVID-19, HIV, etc.) is considered. The numerical results for information propagation in online social network are presented and discussed. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2020. gradient method; Inverse problem; optimization; parameter estimation; partial differential equations; regularization; social network; tensor train; tensor train decomposition Boundary value problems; Gradient methods; Information dissemination; Linear programming; Tensors; Adaptive gradient methods; Decomposition approach; Identification problem; Information propagation; Minimization problems; Multidimensional optimization; Nelder-Mead simplex methods; On-line social networks; Social networking (online) Illiberalism enabled by the coronavirus pandemic: An existential threat to judicial independence For more than a decade, we have witnessed an erosion of political freedoms and civil liberties across the world amidst a democratic backsliding toward autocracy, a system of government in which a single person (the autocrat) possesses absolute power to weaken institutions such as an independent judiciary that sustain the democratic system. At the same time, a surveillance-based economy and anti-democratic threats this poses have thrived. The coronavirus pandemic has enabled these trends, giving authoritarian leaders and surveillance capitalists the opportunity to make massive shifts and reprogramming of our sensibilities about privacy and civil liberties that may not be reversible. The author argues that judicial leaders and court administrators around the globe will need to readjust and adapt to the realities of governance in this new era of illiberalism. He recommends three key changes that courts and justice systems around the world may need to make to deliver justice in the face of the challenges: first, creating a new narrative, one that is less combative, one that aggressively eschews the past's sharply polarized relationships between the judicial branch and the other two branches of government, and one that makes people partners instead of opponents; second, a new approach that puts major emphasis on good governance of the judicial branch, with a focus on competence and performance, an approach that mutes the more strident demands by judicial leaders for absolute judicial independence, coequal status of the judiciary with the executive and the legislative branches of government, and a perfect balance of power between them; finally, ""going global"" and linking up with international partners for global solidarity and collective action, thereby gaining influence and strength from international support back home. © 2020 The Author(s).

This paper suggests that entrepreneurship is also inextricably linked to a fundamental value common among the western developed economies, democracy. Three distinct contexts are examined to link democracy to entrepreneurship, two historical and one contemporary. The first is National Socialism in Germany, which emerged by suppressing both entrepreneurship and democracy. The second is the rise of the Trusts, or dominant large corporations and concomitant decline of small business in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. Finally, both measurement and perception suggest a decline in democracy as well as entrepreneurship in the contemporary era. These concerns are only exacerbated in the current Covid-19 crisis. The paper concludes that an important policy mandate for entrepreneurship may be to ensure the independent, decentralized and autonomous decision-making serving as a cornerstone of democracy. © The Author(s) 2020. authoritarianism; democracy; entrepreneurship; freedom; small business; start-ups; totalitarianism  Planetary Silicon Valley: Deconstructing New York’s innovation complex The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital platforms and software for operating remotely and encouraged employers to reshape the workplace for social distancing. But it is not at all clear what these arrangements will mean for cities that have spent the past decade building an ‘innovation complex’ around physical density, digital technology and real estate development. On the one hand, many parts of the tech ecosystem that relied on face-to-face interaction – such as coworking spaces, hackathons and venture capitalists’ mentoring of start-up founders – have already moved online. On the other hand, cutting tech ecosystems loose from place-based offices, labour markets and institutional networks puts cities’ economic future at risk. This could drastically weaken the value of the city’s fixed capital of buildings and land, its social capital of institutional networks and communities, and its human capital of workers with tech skills. Yet partnering with tech leaders to ‘reimagine’ the city could advance the power of Big Tech. To try to understand which parts of the urban tech ecosystem will likely survive the pandemic, I take a critical look at how the discursive, organisational and geographical spaces of a planetary Silicon Valley culture became embedded in New York between 2010 and 2020. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020. innovation complex; innovation district; New York City; urban economic development; urban tech economy  Organizational participation in post-covid society–its contributions and enabling conditions The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the economic and social problems that societies face today. At the same time, the public response to the crisis points to a constructive way forward. It has brought people together and unleashed a desire to contribute in many ways, some small and others spectacular. It has demonstrated how opportunities for people to participate in collective activities both psychologically and behaviorally can achieve remarkable results, especially when addressing a common danger. This paper argues that it is timely to widen participation in organizational decision-making as an approach to addressing many of the problems which will continue to be with us post-Covid, and which indeed the pandemic has exacerbated. In order to arrive at practical policy options, it proceeds through the following stages. The first is to establish a working definition of organizational participation and to develop a framework for classifying its principal forms. This framework serves to identify the more advanced and consequential forms of participation, and is then used to structure an evidence-based review of how they can constructively contribute to economic and social improvement. The final part of the paper reviews conditions bearing on the practical implementation of participation and which serve to clarify practical policy implications. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Drawing upon feminist theory, we introduce the notion of ‘inclusiveness’ as a fresh conceptualization of the impact of meaning rendering from working, almost irrespective of where work takes place. The ‘new (ab)normal’ that is emerging, is challenging the future of corporations not only in fulfilling their purpose, but also in leading the future leadership necessary to restore the balance between the economy and ecology. In this respect, the corporation is more than a workplace, and leadership is more than a relational process. Inclusive leadership, as we will elaborate when ‘leading from home’, invites us to rethink social distancing and remote working as a platform for rebuilding the fundamentals of humanity. We propose an agenda for leading on leadership in co-creating the future of work and corporations by outlining themes as well as an approach to connecting that no longer separates research and business practice. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd future of corporation; future of work; inclusiveness; leading on leadership; meaningfulness; social distancing  Evaluation of medicinal herbs as a potential therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 targeting its main protease The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a worldwide pandemic and caused huge damage to the lives and economy of more than hundred countries. As on May 10, 2020, more than 4,153,300 people stand infected from the virus due to an unprecedented rate of transmission and 282,700 have lost their lives because of the disease. In this context, medicinal plants may provide a way to treat the disease by targeting specific essential proteins of the virus. We screened about 51 medicinal plants and found that Tea (Camellia sinensis) and Haritaki (Terminalia chebula) has potential against SARS-COV-2 3CLpro, with an IC50 for Green Tea as 8.9 ± 0.5 μg/ml and Haritaki 8.8 ± 0.5 μg/ml. The in-silico studies suggested that Tea component Thearubigins binds to the cysteine 145 of protease active site and could be a pharmacoactive molecule. We predict that the inhibition in protease activity may be able to halt the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and therefore, we propose Green Tea, Black Tea, and Haritaki plant extracts as potential therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation on role of bioactive constituents of extracts is needed to establish the molecular basis of inhibition and towards expedited drug discovery. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 3CLpro; Haritaki; medicinal plants; SARS-CoV-2; tea  The Final Frontier: China, Taiwan, and the United States in Strategic Competition for Central America China’s rise as a global power corresponded with a diminution of Taiwanese diplomacy, which has left Central America as the last region to host a continuous bloc of countries that recognize the ROC. In this article, we argue that China’s success in gaining diplomatic recognition from Taiwan’s former allies has largely resulted from China's economic policy, specifically its promises of large-scale infrastructure projects and the integration of Central American economies with Chinese markets. However, there are limits to how far China has advanced in gaining full recognition from the region. The competing political and economic interests of China, Taiwan, the United States, and the Central American countries themselves, continue to influence patterns of diplomatic switching. More specifically, we argue that the threat of punitive measures from the United States combined with a turn in Taiwanese diplomacy toward assistance efforts to combat Covid-19 may deter future switching in the short to medium-term. Our analysis offers case studies of four Central American countries (Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador and Nicaragua) to illustrate the multi-year processes by which China’s economic strategy leads to diplomatic switching and examine the paths ahead for the remaining holdouts facing the prospect of economic and political penalties by the United States. © 2020, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.

Such mobilities, however, cause disruptive social, spatial and economic transformations of urban and rural landscapes across the globe. Consequently, transnational gentrifications may be considered a crucial testimonial of economic shifts, during the 2008–2020 period of accumulation. In this article, we argue that the underlying conceptual assumptions of transnational gentrifications require crucial adjustments. We should especially consider the intellectual roots that simply celebrate leisure-oriented mobilities while setting aside the exclusionary social practices of the consumption of space, culture, heritage and place. We do this by interpreting the phenomenon by means of a political economy that understands (i) the lens of the multi-scalar organisation of state power as a centrepiece for orchestrating the conditions for transnational gentrifications; (ii) transnational middle-class leisure-oriented mobilities linked dichotomously with labour precariousness and flexibility; and (iii) the rent gap as an analytical tool to understand dispossession, and corresponding displacement of people, practices and discourses. This approach sheds light on the nuances of gentrification as an attribute of systemic violence exercised in financialised capitalism. It also supports us to sketch out a theoretically informed outlook for the ongoing reorientation of intertwined gentrifications by transnational capital investments with intermittent flows of people in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020. displacement/gentrification; employment/labour; history/heritage/memory; housing; social justice  Macroprudential policy and the probability of a banking crisis The ultimate purpose of macroprudential policy is to avoid financial instability, such as banking crises, which have a long-lasting and devastating effect on the economy. Although a growing number of studies have examined the effects of macroprudential policy on credit growth, few empirical studies have analyzed its effect on the probability of a banking crisis. Does macroprudential policy actually affect the probability of a banking crisis? Do other macroeconomic policies matter for the effectiveness of macroprudential policy? To answer these questions, this paper empirically investigates the effect of macroprudential policy on the probability of a banking crisis and its relationship with other macroeconomic policies. Specifically, using data on 65 countries from 2000 to 2016, we employ a probit model to analyze the effect of changes in the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on crisis probability. Our results show that macroprudential policy is effective in changing the probability of a banking crisis via a credit channel and that its effectiveness depends on other macroeconomic policies. Changes in the LTV ratio are found to be effective in influencing the probability of a banking crisis in countries that have inflation targeting frameworks, floating exchange rate regimes, and/or no capital controls. Our results underscore the importance of policy coordination among different government bodies to design an appropriate macroprudential policy, especially in the current context of the Covid-19 crisis. © 2020 The Society for Policy Modeling Banking crisis; Capital control; Exchange rate regime; Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio; Macroprudential policy  Providing a foundation for decent work and adequate income during health and economic crises: constitutional approaches in 193 countries Purpose: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads globally, the economic and health consequences are disproportionately affecting marginalized workers. However, countries' existing labor and social security laws often exclude the most vulnerable workers from coverage, exacerbating existing inequalities. Guaranteeing the rights to adequate income even when ill, decent working conditions and nondiscrimination in constitutions may provide a foundation for protecting rights universally, safeguarding against counterproductive austerity measures, and providing a normative foundation for equality and inclusion as economies recover. The purpose of this article is to examine the prevalence of these rights globally and assess some of their early impacts amid the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors created and analyzed a database of constitutional rights for all 193 United Nations member states. All constitutions were double coded by an international multidisciplinary, multilingual team of researchers. Findings: This study finds that 54% of countries take some approach to guaranteeing income security in their constitutions, including 23% that guarantee income security during illness. Thirty-one percent guarantee the right to safe working conditions. Only 36% of constitutions explicitly guarantee at least some aspect of nondiscrimination at work. With respect to equal rights broadly, constitutional protections are most common on the basis of sex (85%), followed by religion (78%), race/ethnicity (76%), socioeconomic status (59%), disability (27%), citizenship (22%), sexual orientation (5%) and gender identity (3%). Across almost all areas, protections for rights are far more common in constitutions adopted more recently. Originality/value: This is the first study to systematically examine protections for income security and decent work, together with nondiscrimination, in the constitutions of all 193 UN member states. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

While the events directly affecting the world population are concentrated on certain masses, the perception of the society is also affected in this direction and creates cultural changes. One of these global problems is Covid-19 pandemic, which began to spread from Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. WHO declared covid-19 caused by corona virus as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. It spreads rapidly through the respiratory tract and is declared to result in death, especially in patients with chronic diseases and the elderly. It is supported by cultural codes that pandemic is a respiratory disease that increases the risk of death of the elderly population and follows different policies around treatment, care, prevention and protection according to the development level of the countries. Being under direct risk, the elderly population over the age of 65 and those with chronic illnesses in Turkey faced curfew on March 22 and protection approaches are intended to be taken for the elderly population. It is predicted that the risk of transmission will increase compared to the density of the elderly population and measures have been taken accord-ingly. It should be emphasized that the epidemic process and the measures taken affect the aging culture, and cultural changes should be determined by taking into consideration the rate of increase in the population. In this way, revealing the value gains and losses of the elderly in the society and the change experienced by the culture of the aging through the epidemic process will be evaluated in terms of folklore. When the policies of the state are analyzed, the viewpoint of the society towards the elderly and the vital value of the elderly can change. For this reason, it is necessary to reveal the difference between the policies pursued by the state from the policies followed in other world states and to determine the culture-based approaches. Policies on health, economy, socialization, physical isolation, social support and the protection and preventive measures implemented in this context have enabled the change of the culture of elderliness and the change in the society’s perception of elderly in remembering, longing, belonging, fear and anxiety arising from the loss of their value attract attention. How the elderly perceive the epidemic, how they reflect their feelings and perceptions on social media, and their attitude towards the reactions have been directly influential in the regaining of their social roles. The obligatory contact of the elderly group with technology took place in this period and acquiring the right information through the media has gained importance in terms of ease of access to information. Since the prevention of socialization with the curfew only covers the physical distance, communication with people continued remotely through technology, neighbors, friends, balconies, building spaces, etc. and it is thought that communication has been used more intensively with the change of size. When those who comply with the decisions implemented by the state within the scope of health measures and those who do not comply are evaluated, it can be concluded that the perception of aging in the society gains value. It can be said that the approach established by the state on protection and trust is based on respect and love for the elderly in culture. With being a risk group, following precautions, using warnings that appeal to emotions and using appropriate language, the state has modeled the behavior of the elderly with the methods it has followed and it is understood that social memory is an example in recalling cultural codes. © 2020, Milli Folklor Dergisi.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs cross sectional data to analyze 403 SME IPOs issued from Feb 2012 to May 2018 and listed on Bombay Stock Exchange's small and medium enterprise (BSE SME) platform and National Stock Exchange (NSE) EMERGE to investigate the determinants of oversubscription of SME IPOs. Hence, the study makes use of ordinary least square regression and quantile regression to test the hypotheses formulated for the determinants of oversubscription. Findings: The main findings unveil that while issue price, pricing mechanism, listing delay negatively influence oversubscription; firm size, underwriter reputation, hot market and underpricing have been divulged to positively influence oversubscription. However, issue size emerged out to be significant in quantile regression at 25th, 50th and 75th quantiles. Research limitations/implications: The present study is confined to limited number of variables in understanding the factors impacting oversubscription. Future studies could include macroeconomic variables like gross domestic product (GDP), inflation rate, industry specific variable, i.e. technology/nontechnology industry, financial/nonfinancial industry for better understanding. Cross country analysis is suggested in future studies to validate the findings of current study. Future studies are advised to conduct the study examining the factors affecting oversubscription in light of COVID-19 pandemic. Practical implications: The findings of the present study offer implications to academicians, investors, investment advisors and regulators. It provides useful insights to researchers by listing the factors that contribute to variation in subscription levels in emerging economy like India thereby, paving the way for future researches in SME IPOs in countries with different institutional settings. For investors, the study provides additional and novel information useful for IPO valuation and informed investment decisions. In addition, the findings put investment advisors in better place to guide potential investors regarding investment in good quality SME stocks (i.e. highly subscribed stocks) in more informative manner. Last but not the least, as this study would assist the regulators in handling future IPOs in a way that augments the chances of success of SME IPOs. Originality/value: This study is a novel contribution in widening the IPO literature by examining the relationship between pre-IPO firm actions like issue price, pricing mechanism, issue size, firm size, listing delay, underwriter reputation, hot market, underpricing and oversubscription in unexplored settings of Indian SME IPOs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

"5","18","Urban flooding events pose risks of virus spread during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic Since the first report in December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to most parts of the world, with over 21.5 million people infected and nearly 768,000 deaths to date. Evidence suggests that transmission of the virus is primarily through respiratory droplets and contact routes, and airborne carriers such as atmospheric particulates and aerosols have also been proposed as important vectors for the environmental transmission of COVID-19. Sewage and human excreta have long been recognized as potential routes for transmitting human pathogens. The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been detected in human feces and urine, where it could remain viable for days and show infectivity. Urban flooding, a common threat in summer caused by heavy rainfalls, is frequently reported in urban communities along with sewage overflows. With summer already underway and economy re-opening in many parts of the world, urban flooding and the often-accompanied sewage overflows could jeopardize previous mitigation efforts by posing renewed risks of virus spread in affected areas and communities. In this article, we present the up-to-date evidence and discussions on sewage-associated transmission of COVID-19, and highlighted the roles of sewage overflow and sewage-contaminated aerosols in two publicized events of community outbreaks. Further, we collected evidence in real-life environments to demonstrate the shortcuts of exposure to overflowed sewage and non-dispersed human excreta during a local urban flooding event. Given that communities serviced by combined sewer systems are particularly prone to such risks, local municipalities could prioritize wastewater infrastructure upgrades and consider combined sewer separations to minimize the risks of pathogen transmission via sewage overflows during epidemics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fashion rental businesses need to strategically respond to consumers with heightened contamination concerns. This research aims to understand how diverse consumption values of fashion rental service form attitudes towards the service depending on one's contamination concerns and predict adoption intentions. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data (N = 270). The findings suggest that functional, economic, and emotional values significantly increase attitudes leading to adoption intentions. Further, contamination concerns moderate the relationships between values and attitudes as well as attitudes and intentions. The findings enrich the literature of collaborative consumption by integrating theories of consumption value and consumer contamination. Furthermore, the results provide managerial implications for strategic communication of FRS to effectively reach consumers depending on their contamination concern. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (βCoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

These workers and their dependents are in a socially vulnerable and economically difficult situation due to the dire impacts of the COVID-19. Migrant workers from Bangladesh in other countries are facing adverse impacts such as unemployment, short working hours, isolation, poor quality of living, social discrimination and mental pressure while their dependents at home are facing financial crisis due to the limited or reduced cash flow from their working relatives. A significant number of migrant workers have been sent back to Bangladesh and many are in constant fear of being sent back due to the impacts of COVID-19 in their host countries. Thus, COVID-19 intensifies numerous socio-economic crises such as joblessness, consumption of reserve funds by family members, and shrinking of the country's remittance inflow. In this situation, the most urgent and important need is to give financial security and social safety to the workers abroad and those who have returned to Bangladesh. Apart from diplomatic endeavors to maintain the status quo of policy, the government of Bangladesh may take initiatives to provide financial support to these workers as a short-term strategy to overcome hardships during the pandemic and design a comprehensive plan with a detailed database of all migrant workers to create a need-based and skilled workforce as a long-term solution. These strategies can mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 at present and address migration related problems in future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Migrant workers; National economy; Remittance; Unemployment, Bangladesh  Nanoceria as a possible agent for the management of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as an unprecedented global healthcare emergency and has devastated the global economy. The SARS-CoV-2 virus replicates in the host cells and is seemingly much more virulent compared to other flu viruses, as well as the SARS-CoV-1. The respiratory complications of the disease include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, systemic inflammation, and pulmonary fibrosis. Nanoceria (NC) is a versatile rare earth nanoparticle with remarkable catalase and superoxide dismutase mimetic redox regenerative properties. Interestingly, NC possesses promising anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic properties, making it an attractive tool to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 as well as the associated systemic complications. Until now, there is no clinically approved vaccine or drug for the treatment of COVID-19, and the conquest to find a novel therapy for this global havoc is being undertaken at a warlike pace. Herein, based on preclinical evidence, we hypothesize that NC owing to its unique pharmacological properties, might be an attractive preclinical candidate to win the battle over COVID-19. Further, it may be used as a prevention or treatment strategy in combination with other drugs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; Cytokine storm; Lung fibrosis; Nanoceria; SARS-CoV-2 Enzymes; Medical applications; Rare earths; Viruses; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Anti-inflammatories; Global economies; Pharmacological properties; Pulmonary fibrosis; Rare earth nanoparticles; Super oxide dismutase; Systemic inflammation; Diseases; cerium oxide nanoparticle; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; nanocrystal; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; transforming growth factor beta; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antifibrotic activity; antioxidant activity; antiviral activity; Article; chronic inflammation; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug inhibition; drug mechanism; human; lung fibrosis; nanomedicine; oxidative stress; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TGF beta signaling Drug targets for COVID-19 therapeutics: Ongoing global efforts The current global pandemic COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has already inflicted insurmountable damage both to the human lives and global economy. There is an immediate need for identification of effective drugs to contain the disastrous virus outbreak. Global efforts are already underway at a war footing to identify the best drug combination to address the disease. In this review, an attempt has been made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, and based on this information potential druggable targets against SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. Also, the strategies for ongoing and future drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are outlined. Given the urgency to find a definitive cure, ongoing drug repurposing efforts being carried out by various organizations are also described. The unprecedented crisis requires extraordinary efforts from the scientific community to effectively address the issue and prevent further loss of human lives and health. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.

Since the current monetary policy framework features a multi-instrument mix of liquidity tools and pricing signals, we employ a dynamic-factor modelling approach to derive a composite indicator of China's monetary policy stance. Our quantitative assessment shows that the PBoC's policy response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been swift and decisive. Specifically, our estimates reveal that the PBoC has implemented novel policy measures to ensure that commercial banks maintain liquidity access and credit provision during the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V. China; Corona pandemic; COVID-19; Dynamic factor model; Monetary policy  Molecular mechanisms of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and potential anti-COVID19 pharmacological targets since the outbreak of the pandemic The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a severe threat against public health and global economies. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, is highly contagious and has led to an ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 affects, mainly, the respiratory system, with most severe cases primarily showcasing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, no targeted therapy exists, and since the number of infections and death toll keeps rising, it has become a necessity to study possible therapeutic targets. Antiviral drugs can target various stages of the viral infection, and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, both structural and non-structural proteins have been proposed as potential drug targets. This review focuses on the most researched SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their structure, function, and possible therapeutic approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic; Protein; SARS-CoV-2; Spike  Covid-19 pandemic and food: Present knowledge, risks, consumers fears and safety Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease that has paralyzed social life and the economy around the world since the end of 2019, and which has so far killed nearly 600,000 people. The rapidity of its spread and the lack of detailed research on the course and methods of transmission significantly impede both its eradication and prevention. Scope and approach: Due to the high transmission rate and fatality resulting from COVID-19 disease, the paper focuses on analyzing the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 as well as its potential connection with food as a source of pathogen and infection. Key findings and conclusions: There is currently no evidence (scientific publications, WHO, EFSA etc.) that COVID-19 disease can spread directly through food and the human digestive system. However, according to the hypothesis regarding the primary transmission of the virus, the source of which was food of animal origin (meat of wild animals), as well as the fact that food is a basic necessity for humans, it is worth emphasizing that food can, if not directly, be a carrier of the virus. Particular attention should be paid to this indirect pathway when considering the potential for the spread of an epidemic and the development of prevention principles. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Food safety; Prevention; Virus transmission Animals; Digestive system; Transmissions; Viruses; Food of animal origin; High transmission rate; Primary transmission; Scientific publications; Social life; Wild animals; Diseases Relaxed lockdown in Bangladesh during COVID-19: Should economy outweigh health? [краткое описание не найдено]   Temporary reduction in fine particulate matter due to ‘anthropogenic emissions switch-off’ during COVID-19 lockdown in Indian cities The COVID-19 pandemic elicited a global response to limit associated mortality, with social distancing and lockdowns being imposed. In India, human activities were restricted from late March 2020. This ‘anthropogenic emissions switch-off’ presented an opportunity to investigate impacts of COVID-19 mitigation measures on ambient air quality in five Indian cities (Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Mumbai), using in-situ measurements from 2015 to 2020. For each year, we isolated, analysed and compared fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration data from 25 March to 11 May, to elucidate the effects of the lockdown. Like other global cities, we observed substantial reductions in PM2.5 concentrations, from 19 to 43% (Chennai), 41–53% (Delhi), 26–54% (Hyderabad), 24–36% (Kolkata), and 10–39% (Mumbai). Generally, cities with larger traffic volumes showed greater reductions. Aerosol loading decreased by 29% (Chennai), 11% (Delhi), 4% (Kolkata), and 1% (Mumbai) against 2019 data. Health and related economic impact assessments indicated 630 prevented premature deaths during lockdown across all five cities, valued at 0.69 billion USD. Improvements in air quality may be considered a temporary lockdown benefit as revitalising the economy could reverse this trend. Regulatory bodies must closely monitor air quality levels, which currently offer a baseline for future mitigation plans. © 2020 The Author(s) Air pollution; Coronavirus pandemic; Emission switch-off; Health and economic impacts; PM2.5 concentration; SARS-CoV-2 Virus Air quality; Ambient air quality; Anthropogenic emissions; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); In-situ measurement; Mitigation measures; PM2.5 concentration; Substantial reduction; Particles (particulate matter) Non Pharmaceutical Interventions for Optimal Control of COVID-19 Background and Objective: The outbreak of the current pandemic begun from the first individual of a 55-year old from Hubei province in China, the disease instigated by the new coronavirus spreading across the world. Scientists presently speculate this coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, originated in a bat and by one way or another jumped to another creature, potentially the pangolin, which at that point gave it to people. The ailment is currently spreading between individuals with no animal delegate. Researchers are struggling to follow the infection back to where it started to become familiar with its spread. In the event that, for example, specialists can locate the soonest cases, they might have the option to distinguish the creature have where the infection hides. In March and April 2020, researchers detailed that this virus created normally. Coronavirus has been become of the serious global phenomena in the recent years and has negative effects in the entire world health and economy. The virus is believed to have been associated with a host animal which human contracted. Subsequently, human-to-human infection began. Through migration as humans have become complex with easy mobility the disease has traveled to the entire continent. Now, numerous scientist are going on in the hope of obtaining medication and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease and mortality of the disease. It is important that we obtain quantitative and qualitative information about the etiology of this disease which is crucial. Mathematical modeling is capable of providing qualitative information on many parameters that guides the decision making of health practitioners. In this work we focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). To find the role of factors/parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. Methods: To find the role of parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0; the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model. On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control mode. With the help of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian we minimize the density of contaminated stuff and infected human population. Results: We focus the optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs). On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control model. The major NPIs are, STAY HOME, SANITIZER (wash hands), EARLY CASE DETECTION (PCR Test) and FACE MASK. These NPIs helps in mitigation and reducing the size of outbreak of the disease. Conclusion: We check the existence of the optimal solution for the system. At the end, Using matlab we produce numerical simulations for validation of results of control variables. The results demonstrate that if there is no control (variables/interventios), 900 out 1000 susceptible individuals may be infected (exposed) in very short period. As such a circumstances no agency fighting against COVID-19 could be successful due to its limited resources. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

While the pandemic is still in progress, with new incidents being reported every day, the resilience of the global society is constantly being challenged. under these circumstances, the future seems uncertain. SarS-coV-2 coronavirus has spread panic among civilians and insecurity at all socio-political and economic levels, dramatically disrupting everyday life, global economy, international travel and trade. The disease has also been linked to the onset of depression in many individuals due to the extreme restriction measures that have been taken for the prevention of the rapid spreading of coVid-19. First, the socio-economic, political and psychological implications of the coVid-19 pandemic were explored. Substantial evidence is provided for the consequences of the pandemic on all aspects of everyday life, while at the same time we unravel the role and the pursuits of national regimes during this unforeseen situation. The second goal of this review is related to the scientific aspect of the pandemic. Hence, we explain why SarS-coV-2 is not a so-called ‘invisible enemy’, and also attempt to give insight regarding the origin of the virus, in an effort to reject the conspiracy theories that have arisen during the pandemic. Finally, rational strategies were investigated for successful vaccine development. We are optimistic that this review will complement the knowledge of specialized scientists and inform non‑specialized readers on basic scientific questions, and also on the social and economic implications of the coVid-19 pandemic. © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 Agent-based simulation; COVID-19; Epidemic models; SEIR Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Diseases; Simulation platform; Viruses; Agent-based model; Input parameter; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Python programming language; Social cooperations; Social isolation; Society of agents; Vertical isolation; Economic and social effects Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food security and diet-related lifestyle behaviors: An analytical study of google trends-based query volumes The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 disease (COVID)-19 is having profound effects on the global economy and food trade. Limited data are available on how this pandemic is affecting our dietary and lifestyle-related behaviors at the global level. Google Trends was used to obtain worldwide relative search volumes (RSVs) covering a timeframe from before the COVID-19 pandemic 1 June 2019 to 27 April 2020. Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients were used to measure relationships between daily confirmed cases and aforementioned RSVs between 31 December 2019 and 15 April 2020. RSV curves showed increased interest in multiple keywords related to dietary and lifestyle behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown period in March and April 2020. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the strongest variables in each keyword category were (1) food security (food shortage: r = 0.749, food bank: r = 0.660, and free food: r = 0.555; all p < 0.001), (2) dietary behaviors (delivery: r = 0.780, restaurant: r = −0.731, take-away: r = 0.731, and food-delivery: r = 0.693; all p < 0.001), (3) outdoor-related behaviors (resort: r = −0.922, hotel: r = −0.913, cinema: r = −0.844, park: r = −0.827, fitness: r = −0.817, gym: r = −0.811; plant: r = 0.749, sunbathing: r = 0.668, and online: r = 0.670; all p < 0.001), and (4) immune-related nutrients/herbs/foods (vitamin C: r = 0.802, vitamin A: r = 0.780, zinc: r = 0.781, immune: r = 0.739, vitamin E: r = 0.707, garlic: r = 0.667, omega-3 fatty acid: r = −0.633, vitamin D: r = 0.549, and turmeric: r = 0.545; all p < 0.001). Restricted movement has affected peoples’ dietary and lifestyle behaviors as people tend to search for immune-boosting nutrients/herbs and have replaced outdoor activities with sedentary indoor behaviors. © 2020 by the authors.

In the midst of this global public health crisis, a prompt review of the counterinsurgencies that have occurred in different jurisdictions is helpful. This article examines the experience of Hong Kong (HKSAR), which successfully limited its number of confirmed cases to approximately 1100 until early June 2020. Considering the limited actions that the government has taken against the pandemic, we emphasize the prominent role of Hong Kong's civil society through highlighting the strong and spontaneous mobilization of its local communities originating from their experiences during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the social unrest in 2019, as well as their doubts regarding the pandemic assessments and recommendations of the HKSAR and WHO authorities. This article suggests that the influence of civil society should not be overlooked in the context of pandemic management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Asia; civil society; COVID-19; Hong Kong; social mobilization  Effective immune functions of micronutrients against sars-CoV-2 The third coronavirus outbreak in the last two decades has caused significant damage to the world’s economy and community health. The highly contagious COVID-19 infection has affected millions of people to date and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Aside from the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of a treatment or vaccine has been the main reason for its spread. Thus, it has become necessary to find alternative methods for controlling SARS-CoV-2. For the present review, we conducted an online search for different available nutrition-based therapies for previously known coronavirus infections and RNA-based virus infections as well as general antiviral therapies. These treatments have promise for combating COVID-19, as various nutrients and minerals play direct and indirect roles in the control and prevention of this newly emerged viral infection. The patients’ nutritional status with COVID-19 must be analyzed before administering any treatment, and nutritional supplements should be given to the affected individuals along with routine treatment. We suggest a potential interventional role of nutrients to strengthen the immune system against the emerging infection caused by COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Given the fact that this pandemic is still ongoing and there are currently no drugs or vaccines against this novel coronavirus available, this in silico study was conducted to identify a potential novel SARS-CoV-2-inhibitor. Two different approaches were pursued: 1) The Docking Consensus Approach (DCA) is a novel approach, which combines molecular dynamics simulations with molecular docking. 2) The Common Hits Approach (CHA) in contrast focuses on the combination of the feature information of pharmacophore modeling and the flexibility of molecular dynamics simulations. The application of both methods resulted in the identification of 10 compounds with high coronavirus inhibition potential. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Despite the great effort put in the development of vaccines and specific treatments, no prophylaxis or effective therapeutics are currently available. Nitric oxide (NO) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and a potent vasodilator that has proved to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV replication and hypoxia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. Given the potential of NO as treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we have evaluated the in vitro antiviral effect of NO on SARS-CoV-2 replication. The NO-donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) had a dose dependent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 replication, while the non S-nitrosated NAP was not active, as expected. Although the viral replication was not completely abolished (at 200 μM and 400 μM), SNAP delayed or completely prevented the development of viral cytopathic effect in treated cells, and the observed protective effect correlated with the level of inhibition of the viral replication. The capacity of the NO released from SNAP to covalently bind and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL recombinant protease in vitro was also tested. The observed reduction in SARS-CoV-2 protease activity was consistent with S-nitrosation of the enzyme active site cysteine. © 2020 The Author(s) 3CL protease; COVID-19; FRET; Nitric oxide; SARS-CoV-2 anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent; cysteine; n acetyl s nitrosopenicillamine; nitric oxide; proteinase; proteinase inhibitor; recombinant enzyme; antiviral activity; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cytopathogenic effect; drug protein binding; enzyme active site; enzyme inhibition; in vitro study; nonhuman; priority journal; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus replication Case Report: A Recovered SARS CoV-2 Patient Protected From Reinfection The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS CoV-2 is a worldwide emergency, and is taking a substantial toll on human health, lives, and the global economy. Due to the novelty of this virus, no SARS CoV-2-specific treatments or licensed vaccines are available though few vaccines are undergoing clinical trials. Therefore, continued research into an effective vaccine is an urgent necessity. The reinfection of recovered patients is one of the major concerns of healthcare providers worldwide. Health authorities are currently seeking evidence of protection from reinfection in recovered individuals. This is the first case report in Saudi Arabia on a patient who was diagnosed as COVID-19-positive; recovered; and after successful recovery was protected against reinfection. © Copyright © 2020 Mahallawi. herd immunity; protection; reinfection; SARS CoV-2; vaccines  Clinical management of lung cancer patients during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic The rapid growth of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the early December 2019. COVID-19 spread all over the word just a few months. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection poses major threat to international health and economy. World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus was an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020. However, with the spread of COVID-19, the routine medical care of lung cancer patients was affected. Because lung cancer patients have low immunity after anti-tumor treatment, they should become the main targets for epidemic prevention. Lung cancer patients are increasingly concerned about the prevention of COVID-19. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management for lung cancer patients based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns. © 2020 The Author(s).

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology — WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology — one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations. © 2020 Covid-19; Epidemiology; Pandemic; SARSCoV-2; Sewage; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) Diagnosis; Food supply; Network security; Public health; Sewage; Chemical signatures; Clinical diagnostics; Diagnostic testing; Environmental scientists; Financial institution; Large-scale applications; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Therapeutic treatments; Diseases; COVID-19; epidemic; epidemiology; future prospect; severe acute respiratory syndrome; sewage; viral disease; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; diagnostic test; disease surveillance; disease transmission; environmental monitoring; epidemiological monitoring; human; international cooperation; mass screening; medical research; nonhuman; pandemic; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; public health; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; sewage; waste water; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; isolation and purification; virology; virus pneumonia; waste water; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; virus RNA; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemiological Monitoring; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; RNA, Viral; Waste Water Strategies for Targeting SARS CoV-2: Small Molecule Inhibitors—The Current Status Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) induced Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19) cases have been increasing at an alarming rate (7.4 million positive cases as on June 11 2020), causing high mortality (4,17,956 deaths as on June 11 2020) and economic loss (a 3.2% shrink in global economy in 2020) across 212 countries globally. The clinical manifestations of this disease are pneumonia, lung injury, inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective pharmacological agents available for the prevention/treatment of SARS-CoV2 infections. Moreover, development of a suitable vaccine is a challenging task due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and Th-2 immunopathology, which aggravates infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain exhibits several distinct genomic and structural patterns compared to other coronavirus strains, making the development of a suitable vaccine even more difficult. Therefore, the identification of novel small molecule inhibitors (NSMIs) that can interfere with viral entry or viral propagation is of special interest and is vital in managing already infected cases. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by the binding of viral Spike proteins (S-protein) to human cells through a 2-step process, which involves Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS)-2. Therefore, the development of novel inhibitors of ACE2/TMPRSS2 is likely to be beneficial in combating SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the usage of ACE-2 inhibitors to block the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry requires additional studies as there are conflicting findings and severe health complications reported for these inhibitors in patients. Hence, the current interest is shifted toward the development of NSMIs, which includes natural antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to manage a SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is imperative to investigate the efficacy of existing antiviral phytochemicals and Nrf-2 activators to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2-mediated oxidative stress. Therefore, in this review, we have reviewed structural features of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on key molecular targets and their known modulators that can be considered for the development of NSMIs. © Copyright © 2020 Beeraka, Sadhu, Madhunapantula, Rao Pragada, Svistunov, Nikolenko, Mikhaleva and Aliev.

However, when and whether LSD can be considered is subject to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the recovery rate, and the case-fatality rate. It is imperative to provide real-time assessment of three factors to guide LSD. Objective: A simple LSD index was developed for health decision makers to do real-time assessment of COVID-19 at the global, country, region, and community level. Methods: Data on the retrospective cohort of 186 countries with three factors were retrieved from a publicly available repository from January to early July. A simple index for guiding LSD was measured by the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and recoveries, and the case-fatality rate was envisaged. If the LSD index was less than 1, LSD can be considered. The dynamic changes of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated to assess whether and when health decision makers allowed for LSD and when to reimplement social distancing after resurgences of the epidemic. Results: After large-scale outbreaks in a few countries before mid-March (prepandemic phase), the global weekly LSD index peaked at 4.27 in March and lasted until mid-June (pandemic phase), during which most countries were affected and needed to take various social distancing measures. Since, the value of LSD has gradually declined to 0.99 on July 5 (postpandemic phase), at which 64.7% (120/186) of countries and regions had an LSD<1 with the decile between 0 and 1 to refine risk stratification by countries. The LSD index decreased to 1 in about 115 days. In addition, we present the results of dynamic changes of the LSD index for the world and for each country and region with different time windows from January to July 5. The results of the LSD index on the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in certain regions and validation by other emerging infectious diseases are presented. Conclusions: This simple LSD index provides a quantitative assessment of whether and when to ease or implement social distancing to provide advice for health decision makers and travelers. © Sam Li-Sheng Chen, Amy Ming-Fang Yen, Chao-Chih Lai, Chen-Yang Hsu, Chang-Chuan Chan, Tony Hsiu-Hsi Chen.

A cross-sectional study using a web-based approach was conducted in the second week of April 2020 to examine the influence of the national social distancing on the quality of life and economic well-being of Vietnamese citizens under COVID-19 pandemic. The data included socio-economic characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on household income, health status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Ordered logistic regression and multivariable Tobit regression model were employed to examine factors correlated to income change and HRQOL. Results showed that among 341 participants, 66.9% reported household income loss due to the impact of COVID-19. People holding undergraduate degrees, working in other sectors rather than healthcare, and having definite-term contract had a higher likelihood of income reduction. The mean score of EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS was 0.95 (± 0.07) and 88.2 (± 11.0), respectively. The domain of Anxiety/Depression had the highest proportion of reporting any problems among 5 dimensions of EQ-5D-5L (38.7%). Being female, having chronic conditions and living in the family with 3–5 members were associated with lower HRQOL scores. A comprehensive assessment of the influence of COVID-19 along with public health interventions, especially mental health programs, should be implemented to mitigate the negative effects of this pandemic on the economic status and quality of life of citizens. © Copyright © 2020 Tran, Nguyen, Le, Latkin, Pham, Vu, Le, Nguyen, Pham, Ta, Nguyen, Ho and Ho.

In the process of fighting against the epidemic in China, the clinical value of a variety of herbal medicines has been recognized and written into the clinical application guide. However, their effective molecular mechanism and potential targets are still not clear. Pathology and pharmacology research will gradually attract attention in the post-epidemic outbreak term. Here, we constructed a COVID-19 protein microarray of potential therapy targets, which contains the main drug targets to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the anti-virus, anti-inflammatory cellar targets of the host. Series of quality controls test has been carried out, which showed that it could be applied for drug target screening of bio-active natural products. The establishment of this microarray will provide a useful tool for the study of the molecular pharmacology of natural products. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines against future pathogens. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Sartorius, D’Apice, Manco and De Berardinis. antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19; emerging infectious diseases; epidemics; pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; vaccines; viruses bacterial vaccine; CD47 antigen; DNA vaccine; hemagglutinin; hepatitis B surface antigen; live vaccine; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; subunit vaccine; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; inactivated vaccine; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody response; avian influenza (H5N1); cross reaction; cytokine production; dendritic cell; dengue; Dengue virus; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; gene expression; health care personnel; hepatitis E; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; innate immunity; Lassa fever; liver injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Review; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; SARS coronavirus; vaccination; virus infection; virus neutralization; virus particle; West Nile fever; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vaccines, DNA; Vaccines, Inactivated; Vaccines, Subunit; Viral Vaccines Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19): An updated review The current outbreak of novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major pandemic situation and a catastrophe for humans. COVID-19 is a severe infectious disease particularly of the respiratory system characterized by fatal complications such as severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmia, kidney failure/ multiple organ failure and even death. Since its discovery, the SARS-CoV-2 has spread across 213 countries or territories, causing more than 8.5 million people with a rising death toll over 5.5 million people (as of June 2020, WHO). In fact, the current looming crisis of COVID-19 has become an increasingly serious concern to public health. It has affected lives of millions of people with severe impact on health systems and economies globally. Since there are no specific drugs and/or vaccines available so far, combating COVID-19 remains to be a major challenging task. Therefore, development of potential and effective treatment regimens (prophylactic/therapeutic) is urgently required which could resolve the issue. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the coronavirus, disease epidemiology, clinical manifestations and risk factors, replication of the virus, pathophysiology and host immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The therapeutic interventions and prophylactic measures along with precautionary measures are the frontline approaches that could be undertaken in order to control and prevent the spread of the deadly and highly contagious COVID-19 are also detailed herein. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

In fact, the current moment of health, economic, and social crisis that we are experiencing seems to be no exception. Tourism seems to be one of the most affected activities by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis-due not only the cancelled flights but also to the fear of being infected with the virus. In this sense, the present article intends to identify the Azores Archipelago residents' tourism expectations during the COVID-19 crisis. Using the Azores Islands as a case study and merging it with the authors' knowledge about this regional reality, it was possible to collect a substantial quantity of data. Thus, this study provides an in-depth perception of the main issues about how this pandemic crisis affects the tourism expectations of the Azores region residents, and consequently, how this situation will influence regional sustainable development. Through the study, it was possible to verify that the significant part of the Azores Archipelago residents (57.5%) will not be going to travel to spend vacations in 2020. Additionally, 84.2% will have holidays in the region; therefore, they stay in the Azores Archipelago. Besides, this study shows that majority of the respondents (61.6%) would not make a reservation for a 2020 vacation. © 2020 by the authors.

Vaccines that induce large quantities of high affinity virus-neutralizing antibodies may optimally prevent infection and avoid unfavorable effects. Vaccination trials require precise clinical management, complemented with detailed evaluation of safety and immune responses. Here, we review the pros and cons of available vaccine platforms and options to accelerate vaccine development towards the safe immunization of the world’s population against SARS-CoV-2. Favorable vaccines, used in well-designed vaccination strategies, may be critical for limiting harm and promoting trust and a long-term return to normal public life and economy. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is being used widely to detect COVID-19 from various types of biological specimens, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and may not be rapidly deployable in remote or resource-limited settings. This might lead to hindrance in acquiring realistic data of infectivity and community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. This review summarizes the existing status of current diagnostic methods, their possible limitations, and the advantages of biosensor-based diagnostics over the conventional ones for the detection of SARS-Cov-2. Novel biosensors used to detect RNA-viruses include CRISPR-Cas9 based paper strip, nucleic-acid based, aptamer-based, antigen-Au/Ag nanoparticles-based electrochemical biosensor, optical biosensor, and Surface Plasmon Resonance. These could be effective tools for rapid, authentic, portable, and more promising diagnosis in the current pandemic that has affected the world economies and humanity. Present challenges and future perspectives of developing robust biosensors devices for rapid, scalable, and sensitive detection and management of COVID-19 are presented in light of the test-test-test theme of the World Health Organization (WHO). © 2020, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

Proposed model is novel since it additionally includes parameters i.e. silent carriers, sociability of newly infected person and unregistered died coronavirus infected people along with the infection rate, suspected rate and death rate. These parameters contribute a lot to figure out the more clear model, along with essential parameters. The model takes the testing rate of suspected people into consideration and this rate varies with respect to phase of the epidemic growth. Proposed 3P-SIRD model is divided into three-phases based on the awareness and sustainability of disease. Time is divided into different periods as rate of infection and recovery fluctuates region to region. The model is tested on China data and is efficient enough to propose a model very close to their actual figures of infected people, recovered people, died and active cases. The model predicts the optimal lockdown period as 73 days for China which is very close to their actual lockdown period (77 days). Further, the model is implemented to predict the optimal lockdown period of India and Italy. © 2020 COVID-19; Lockdown; Pandemic; Silent Carriers; SIRD Model Geographical regions; Coronaviruses; Death rates; Infection rates; Parametric approach; Rate of infections; Three phase; Three phasis; Transmission chains; Recovery Is COVID-19 the end of US hegemony? Public bads, leadership failures and monetary hegemony COVID-19 is the most invasive global crisis in the postwar era, jeopardizing all dimensions of human activity. By theorizing COVID-19 as a public bad, I shed light on one of the great debates of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries regarding the relationship between the United States and liberal international order (LIO). Conceptualizing the pandemic as a public bad, I analyze its consequences for US hegemony. Unlike other international public bads and many of the most important public goods that make up the LIO, the COVID-19 public bad not only has some degree of rivalry but can be made partially excludable, transforming it into more of a club good. Domestically, I demonstrate how the failure to effectively manage the COVID-19 public bad has compromised America's ability to secure the health of its citizens and the domestic economy, the very foundations for its international leadership. These failures jeopardize US provision of other global public goods. Internationally, I show how the US has already used the crisis strategically to reinforce its opposition to free international movement while abandoning the primary international institution tasked with fighting the public bad, the World Health Organization (WHO). While the only area where the United States has exercised leadership is in the monetary sphere, I argue this feat is more consequential for maintaining hegemony. However, even monetary hegemony could be at risk if the pandemic continues to be mismanaged. © The Author(s) 2020.   Digital media's role in the COVID-19 pandemic The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak has had a significant impact on global health, the economy, and society as a whole. Various measures are being taken to respond to the pandemic, with digital media playing a pivotal role, especially in the use of visual data to disseminate information, mobile health to coordinate medical resources, social media to promote public health campaigns, and digital tools to assist population management and disease tracing. However, digital media also faces some challenges like misinformation, lack of guidance, and information leakage. We encourage the increased use of digital media with a focus on improving trust, building social solidarity, reducing chaos, educating the public on prevention measures, and reducing the medical burden in facility-based sites. © 2020 JMIR Publications.

Absent an effective vaccine, preventive measures used, some of which are being relaxed, have included school closures, restriction of movement, and banning of large gatherings. Our goal was to estimate the association of voter turnout with county-level COVID-19 risks. Methods: We used publicly available data on voter turnout in the March 10 primary in three states, COVID-19 confirmed cases by day and county, and county-level census data. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to estimate the association of voter turnout with COVID-19 incidence, adjusted for county-level population density and proportions: over age 65 years, female, Black, with college education, with high school education, poor, obese, and smokers. Results: COVID-19 risk was associated with voter turnout, most strongly in Michigan during the week starting 3 days postelection (risk ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.16–1.33). For longer periods, the association was progressively weaker (risk ratio 0.98–1.03). Conclusions: Despite increased absentee-ballot voting in the primary, our results suggest an association of voter turnout in at least one state with a detectable increase in risks associated with and perhaps due to greater exposures related to the primary. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine. Method: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: In conclusion, we discuss possible clues/ target sites for designing of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus based on prior-art. © 2020 Diabetes India Adjuvants; Antigens; Coronavirus disease vaccine; COVID-19 vaccine; Spike protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Coronavirus vaccine; DNA vaccine; immunological adjuvant; inactivated vaccine; live vaccine; nanomaterial; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; virus antigen; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; animal model; Article; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug repositioning; human; infection control; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; protein subunit; SARS coronavirus; scale up; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; vaccine production; virus genome; virus mutation; virus virulence; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; immunology; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Viral Vaccines Antiviral potential of nanoparticles—can nanoparticles fight against coronaviruses? Infectious diseases account for more than 20% of global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths. Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Based on in-depth interviews with supply chain professionals and grounded theory approach, we constructed a framework of global sourcing improvement to support better utilization of lean, agile, and leagile strategies, which we believe can help the supply chains worldwide to act better, especially in various difficult conditions and sustain their business accordingly. Our proposed framework also contributes to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, since the core concept of the framework is to establish a new organization under the umbrella of the UN to improve the global sourcing and consequently the usage of supply chain strategies accordingly. The applicative part of the paper reveals characteristics of new developed framework, ranging from its purpose and aims, structure, key processes, functions, and its financing. Along with validation of the framework are presented benefits for society, industry, and global economy. Additionally, the paper also reviews the impact of the current health and economic crisis caused by COVID 19, on usage of the three supply chain strategies namely; lean, agility, and leagility to see how they can work in the difficult time, as COVID 19. © 2020 by the authors.

In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China. To reduce the case-fatality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 patients, we should not ignore the complications, such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. To help understand the advantages and limitations of differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, and chloroquine), glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation based on available evidence. As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. coronavirus; COVID-19; literature review; pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2; treatment chloroquine; corticosteroid; placebo; remdesivir; ribavirin; adult respiratory distress syndrome; antiviral therapy; avascular necrosis; cardiotoxicity; case fatality rate; continuous hemofiltration; coronavirus disease 2019; cytokine storm; diabetes mellitus; drug accumulation; drug blood level; drug mechanism; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; extracorporeal oxygenation; hemolytic anemia; hemorrhagic fever; human; influenza A (H7N9); liver failure; malaria; Middle East respiratory syndrome; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; plasma exchange; psychosis; retinopathy; Review; secondary infection; severe acute respiratory syndrome; unspecified side effect Computational analysis of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 surveillance by wastewater-based epidemiology locally and globally: Feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods. © 2020 The Authors Coronavirus; Global health; Modeling; Wastewater-based epidemiology Computational methods; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Population statistics; Travel time; Computational analysis; Global economics; Local conditions; Medical screening; Orders of magnitude; Population sizes; Specific location; Two-step process; Monitoring; COVID-19; epidemiology; infectious disease; respiratory disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; temperature effect; wastewater; Article; clinical evaluation; computer simulation; coronavirus disease 2019; cost control; disease surveillance; feasibility study; geographic distribution; global health; human; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; pandemic; population size; priority journal; resource management; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; waste water; wastewater based epidemiology; water temperature; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; Louisiana; New York; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Detroit; Hubei; Iran; Italy; Lombardy; Louisiana; Madrid [Spain]; Michigan; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; New Orleans; New York [United States]; Seattle; Spain; Tehran [Iran]; United States; Washington [United States]; Wuhan; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Feasibility Studies; Humans; New Orleans; New York City; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring Potent neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients define multiple targets of vulnerability The rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a large impact on global health, travel, and economy. Therefore, preventative and therapeutic measures are urgently needed. Here, we isolated monoclonal antibodies from three convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients using a SARS-CoV-2 stabilized prefusion spike protein. These antibodies had low levels of somatic hypermutation and showed a strong enrichment in VH1-69, VH3-30-3, and VH1-24 gene usage. A subset of the antibodies was able to potently inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection at a concentration as low as 0.007 micrograms per milliliter. Competition and electron microscopy studies illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains multiple distinct antigenic sites, including several receptor-binding domain (RBD) epitopes as well as non-RBD epitopes. In addition to providing guidance for vaccine design, the antibodies described here are promising candidates for COVID-19 treatment and prevention. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Unfortunately, there is not currently available vaccine for SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19. Various types of patients have delayed treatment or even routine check-ups and we are adapting to a virtual world. In many cases, surgeries are delayed unless they are essential. This is also true with regards to cancer treatments and screening. Interestingly, some existing drugs and nutraceuticals have been screened for their effects on COVID-19. Certain FDA approved drugs, vitamin, natural products and trace minerals may be repurposed to treat or improve the prevention of COVID-19 infections and disease progression. This review article will summarize how the treatments of various cancer patients has changed during the COVID-19 era as well as discuss the promise of some existing drugs and other agents to be repurposed to treat this disease. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Cancer; COVID-19; Natural products; Nutraceuticals; Repurposing approved drugs angiotensin converting enzyme 2; antineoplastic agent; antivirus agent; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxychloroquine; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; trace element; vitamin; Betacoronavirus; comorbidity; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; drug repositioning; gene expression regulation; genetics; host pathogen interaction; human; immunology; neoplasm; pandemic; pathogenicity; signal transduction; virology; virus pneumonia; Antineoplastic Agents; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Repositioning; Gene Expression Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Signal Transduction; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Trace Elements; Vitamins Effects of control measures on the dynamics of COVID-19 and double-peak behavior in Spain The COVID-19 disease significantly has threatened the human lives and economy. It is a dynamic system with transmission and control as factors. Modeling the dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 based on the reported data can predict the growing trend of such a disease. In this paper, the dynamic evolution of COVID-19 in Spain is studied, and a comprehensive SEIR model is adopted to fit the obtained clinical progressive data of COVID-19 in Spain. The transmission rate between the susceptible and the self-quarantine susceptible is made to be time-variant, which is reasonable. The equilibria are found, and the stability condition is given using the basic reproduction number and eigenvalues at the points. The effect on daily confirmed cases for the transmission rate from susceptible to the exposed population due to the currently exposed and infectious is extensively investigated. The risk of the easing of the control measure is investigated. The double-peak dynamic behavior of the COVID-19 system is observed. The second wave rebound shows that the daily confirmed cases of the second peak even much higher than the first peak. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

A common factor for conditions that predispose for serious progress is a low-grade inflammation, e.g., as seen in metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and heart failure, to which micronutrient deficiencies may contribute. The aim of the present article was to explore the usefulness of early micronutrient intervention, with focus on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, to relieve escalation of COVID-19. Methods: We conducted an online search for articles published in the period 2010-2020 on zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and corona and related virus infections. Results: There were a few studies providing direct evidence on associations between zinc, selenium, and vitamin D, and COVID-19. Adequate supply of zinc, selenium, and vitamin D is essential for resistance to other viral infections, immune function, and reduced inflammation. Hence, it is suggested that nutrition intervention securing an adequate status might protect against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - coronavirus-2) and mitigate the course of COVID-19. Conclusion: We recommended initiation of adequate supplementation in high-risk areas and/or soon after the time of suspected infection with SARS-CoV-2. Subjects in high-risk groups should have high priority as regards this nutritive adjuvant therapy, which should be started prior to administration of specific and supportive medical measures. © 2020 by the authors.

From the beginning of the outbreak to now, there have been many mathematical models proposed to describe the spread of the pandemic, and most of them are established with the assumption that people contact with each other in a homogeneous pattern. However, owing to the difference of individuals in reality, social contact is usually heterogeneous, and the models on homogeneous networks cannot accurately describe the outbreak. Thus, we propose a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model on social networks to describe the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. Then, according to the results of the simulations, we discover that the measures that can curb the spread of COVID-19 include increasing the recovery rate and the removed rate, cutting off connections between symptomatically infected individuals and their neighbours, and cutting off connections between hub nodes and their neighbours. The feasible measures proposed in the paper are in fair agreement with the measures that the government took to suppress the outbreak. Furthermore, effective measures should be carried out immediately, otherwise the pandemic would spread more rapidly and last longer. In addition, we use the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2 to analyse the outbreak in the city and explain why the number of the infected rose in the early stage of the outbreak though a total lockdown was implemented. Moreover, besides the above measures, a feasible way to curb the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the density of social networks, such as restricting mobility and decreasing in-person social contacts. This work provides a series of effective measures, which can facilitate the selection of appropriate approaches for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its adverse impact on people’s livelihood, societies and economies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Most countries are enforcing strict quarantine to control the havoc of this highly contagious disease. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many data analyses have been done to provide close support to decision-makers. We propose a method comprising data analytics and machine learning classification for evaluating the effectiveness of lockdown regulations. Lockdown regulations should be reviewed on a regular basis by governments, to enable reasonable control over the outbreak. The model aims to measure the efficiency of lockdown procedures for various countries. The model shows a direct correlation between lockdown procedures and the infection rate. Lockdown efficiency is measured by finding a correlation coefficient between lockdown attributes and the infection rate. The lockdown attributes include retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, residential, and schools. Our results show that combining all the independent attributes in our study resulted in a higher correlation (0.68) to the dependent value Interquartile 3 (Q3). Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was found to be the least value when combining all attributes. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

COVID-19 is one of the most serious infectious disease threats in the past 100 years. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that early diagnosis of infectious COVID-19 cases is of great help to slow down the spread of disease and reduce mortality. Therefore, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of great significance in the control of the pandemic. However, because patients with COVID-19 show partially similar symptoms to diseases such as influenza-like illness, it is impossible to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection by relying solely on the patient's clinical features. Meanwhile, there are a number of asymptomatic patients, who are capable of spreading the infection while passing general surveillance. The early diagnosis of such cases is also critical for the prevention of the outbreak and control of the pandemic. Given there is no effective SARS-CoV-2-specific anti-viral agents, chemists are engaging in the development of analytical strategies for the SARS-CoV-2 detection and antiviral drug to combat the spread of the COVID-19. In order to support the innovation in the ongoing research on fighting COVID-19 pandemic, we summarized part of the achievements in SARS-CoV-2 detection and drug development engaged by chemists in China. By summarizing the available products and patents with practical potentials in fast analysis, we discussed the recent advances in the techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection and their application potentials in diagnosis of COVID-19. For the diagnosis of COVID-19, the most specific analysis method is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based nucleic acid assay. At the end of March, National Medical Products Administration has approved more than 20 products aiming at SARS-CoV-2 test, most of which are kits based on the principle of real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Because PCR-based method needs complex manual operation steps, the technique is limited due to the time-consuming reaction steps. Later on, techniques with multiple procedures including nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and virus detection have been integrated for rapid detection. In order to solve the problems caused by disadvantages of complex thermal cycling process in PCR, isothermal amplification has been applied for nucleic acid detection. Combined with isothermal amplification, rapid point-of-care test is applicable for the detection of collected SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Although viral RNA assay is the most specific method for diagnosis of COVID-19, it cannot be used to determine the post-infection or monitor the immunity of general populations. The immunological assays could be applied for the detection of antibodies themselves several days after the infection by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, and other technologies have successfully applied for the immune assay. Some reagents, detection kits, and devices have been certificated and marketed internationally. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents have been designed and tested. Moreover, several small-molecule drug candidates with high efficacy and low toxicity showed great potential in clinical application. Facing the outbreak of epidemic of COVID-19, Department of Chemical Sciences, Department of Mathematical and Physical Sciences of National Natural Science Foundation of China have jointly funded three innovative projects to support the research on the effective and expedite control of the epidemic. These projects include ""Research on rapid detection of new coronavirus in aerosol on site"", ""A pre-clinical study of using small molecules to treat SARS-CoV-2-induced excessive inflammation and injury"", and ""Polymer micro-/nano-fibrous non-woven fabrics prepared via flash-pressure- released technology and reusable high-quality medical protective suits produced with these fabrics"". The pandemic of COVID-19 is a major public health emergency, which poses a major challenge to health system worldwide and also has a major impact on economy and society. In response to sudden large-scale outbreaks, rapid, accurate and high-throughput detection technology is undoubtedly the priority of ""anti-epidemic"". Focusing on the present and serving the long-term requirement, we still need to innovatively propose new ideas to meet the major needs in the diagnosis and treatment of major diseases based on a global perspective. © 2020, Science Press.

As the rate of infection starts to slow, healthcare facilities and economies attempt to return to normalcy in a graduated manner and the massive pent-up demand for surgeries needs to eventually be addressed in a systematic and equitable manner. Materials and methods: Guidelines from the Alliance of International Organizations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Orthopaedic Trauma Association, American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anaesthesiologists, Association of perioperative Registered Nurses, American Hospital Association, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were evaluated and summarized into a working framework, relevant to orthopaedic surgeons. Results: The guiding principles for restarting elective surgeries in a safe and acceptable manner include up-to-date disease awareness, projection and judicious management of equipment and facilities, effective human resource management, a fair and transparent system to prioritize cases, optimization of peri-operative workflows and continuous data gathering and clinical governance. Conclusion: The world was ill prepared for the initial COVID-19 outbreak. However, with effective forward planning, institutions can ramp-up elective surgical caseload in a safe and equitable manner. © 2020 IJS Publishing Group Ltd Coronavirus; COVID-19; Elective surgery; Orthopaedic surgery; Pandemic anesthesiologist; awareness; coronavirus disease 2019; elective surgery; health care facility; health workforce; human; international organization; medicaid; medical society; medicare; orthopedic surgeon; orthopedic surgery; pandemic; perioperative period; practice guideline; priority journal; public health service; registered nurse; resource management; Review; traumatology; World Health Organization; anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; organization and management; orthopedic surgery; orthopedics; perioperative nursing; personnel management; procedures; United States; virus pneumonia; workflow; American Hospital Association; Anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S.; Coronavirus Infections; Elective Surgical Procedures; Humans; Medicare; Orthopedic Procedures; Orthopedics; Pandemics; Perioperative Nursing; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Societies, Medical; Traumatology; United States; Workflow; World Health Organization Newly emerging human coronaviruses: Animal models and vaccine research for SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 The recent emergence of the novel coronavirus (CoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global threat to human health and economy. As of June 26, 2020, over 9.4 million cases of infection, including 482,730 deaths, had been confirmed across 216 countries. To combat a devastating virus pandemic, numerous studies on vaccine development are urgently being accelerated. In this review article, we take a brief look at the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoVs and discuss recent approaches to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development. © 2020.

As the world is struggling to minimize the transmission of this devastating disease, several strategies are being actively deployed to develop therapeutic interventions. Pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers are relentlessly working to investigate experimental, repurposed or FDA-approved drugs on a compassionate basis and novel biologics for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and treatment. Presently, a tremendous surge of COVID-19 clinical trials are advancing through different stages. Among currently registered clinical efforts, ~86% are centered on testing small molecules or antibodies either alone or in combination with immunomodulators. The rest ~14% of clinical efforts are aimed at evaluating vaccines and convalescent plasma-based therapies to mitigate the disease's symptoms. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic modalities being evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Later it is identified as Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) This life-threatening disease spreads fastly worldwide and makes some disturbances in the health system, economy, and society. It affects many organs, especially the respiratory tract. Kidney involvement presents a lot of patients and increases morbidity and mortality. A recent study showed that abnormal kidney function was related to death in patients with COVID-19. This complication should be considered to prevent the worsening of the disease. The immune system plays a major role in this pathogenesis of disease and kidney problems. In this difficult situation, understanding COVID-19 and kidney diseases will help us to get proper management and prevention to solve the problem. © 2020 EManuscript Technologies.

Mask or no mask for COVID-19: A public health and market study Efficient strategies to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are peremptory to relieve the negatively impacted public health and global economy, with the full scope yet to unfold. In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies. © 2020 Li et al.

There are currently no specific registered antiviral drugs to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Therefore, drug repurposing would be the fastest route to provide at least a temporary solution while better, more specific drugs are being developed. Here, we demonstrate that the antiparasitic drug suramin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, protecting Vero E6 cells with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of ~20μM, which is well below the maximum attainable level in human serum. Suramin also decreased the viral load by 2 to 3 logs when Vero E6 cells or cells of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3 2B4 [referred to here as ""Calu-3""]) were treated. Time-of-addition and plaque reduction assays performed on Vero E6 cells showed that suramin acts on early steps of the replication cycle, possibly preventing binding or entry of the virus. In a primary human airway epithelial cell culture model, suramin also inhibited the progression of infection. The results of our preclinical study warrant further investigation and suggest that it is worth evaluating whether suramin provides any benefit for COVID-19 patients, which obviously requires safety studies and well-designed, properly controlled randomized clinical trials.

This has been proposed with a double aim: (1) an in-depth verification of the analytical and clinical performances presented by the manufacturer and (2) an economy of scale in terms of centralized validation for all the laboratories using the tests subject to evaluation. A retrospective validation study was conducted including the serum of 125 patients in order to determine the analytical and clinical performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 from DiaSorin® detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and to compare its clinical performance with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test from Euroimmun®, one of the first commercially available tests allowing the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG. The performances of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 satisfied all the acceptance criteria and provided ""real world""analytical and clinical performances very close to the ones reported by the manufacturer in its insert kit. Comparison between the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 and the ELISA method did not reveal any difference between the two techniques in terms of sensitivities and specificities regarding the determination of the IgG. This study reports the validation of the LIAISON®SARS-CoV-2 allowing to detect IgG antibodies specifically directed against SARS-CoV-2. The analytical and clinical performances are excellent, and the automation of the test offers important rates, ideal for absorbing an extension of testing. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

A promising target for both diagnosis and therapeutics treatments of the new disease named COVID-19 is the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) glycoprotein. By constant-pH Monte Carlo simulations and the PROCEEDpKa method, we have mapped the electrostatic epitopes for four monoclonal antibodies and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both SARS-CoV-1 and the new SARS-CoV-2 S receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins. We also calculated free energy of interactions and shown that the S RBD proteins from both SARS viruses binds to ACE2 with similar affinities. However, the affinity between the S RBD protein from the new SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is higher than for any studied antibody previously found complexed with SARS-CoV-1. Based on physical chemical analysis and free energies estimates, we can shed some light on the involved molecular recognition processes, their clinical aspects, the implications for drug developments, and suggest structural modifications on the CR3022 antibody that would improve its binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to address the ongoing international health crisis. © 2020 ACE2; Antibody development; Antigenic analysis; Binding affinity; Computer simulation; Coronavirus; Electrostatic interactions; Epitopes; Host-pathogen interaction; pH effect; Protein-protein interaction; SARS-CoV-2 amino acid; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; epitope; monoclonal antibody; virus spike protein; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; monoclonal antibody; protein binding; spike glycoprotein, SARS-CoV; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2; virus antibody; virus receptor; Article; binding affinity; chemical structure; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; crystal structure; dielectric constant; drug development; ionic strength; molecular recognition; Monte Carlo method; pH; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein domain; protein protein interaction; receptor binding; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; simulation; Betacoronavirus; chemistry; computer simulation; epitope mapping; human; immunology; metabolism; molecular model; protein analysis; protein conformation; protein domain; SARS coronavirus; thermodynamics; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Computer Simulation; Epitope Mapping; Humans; Models, Molecular; Monte Carlo Method; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Interaction Mapping; Receptors, Virus; SARS Virus; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Thermodynamics Supply chain finance review: Current situation and future trend Supply chain finance plays an important role in alleviating the fund shortage of small and medium-sized enterprises and optimizing the fund flow of supply chain. At present, the development of supply chain finance is facing an important point: The Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has a wide impact on the global economy, which not only generates the strong demand for supply chain finance, but also brings new uncertainty. At the same time, the accelerated development of Fintech provides more possibilities and tools for supply chain finance model innovation and risk management. This paper summarizes the current situation of supply chain finance from two aspects of practical development and theoretical research, and analyzes its future development trend. First of all, the practical development of supply chain finance is sorted out and divided into four stages for analysis. Secondly, with the help of bibliometrics tools, this paper analyzes and compares English and Chinese literature, and summarizes the theoretical research status from three aspects: Theoretical basis, optimization decision-making and risk management. Finally, there are three development trends of supply chain finance in the future, that is, the formation of healthy network ecosystem is an important basis for the development of supply chain finance, the adoption of modern Fintech enabling is a powerful tool for the development of supply chain finance, and bearing the social responsibility of sustainable development is the long-term goal of supply chain finance development. Meanwhile, it gives five key research issues that deserve attention. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of Systems Engineering Society of China. All right reserved.

Resource-poor countries with weaker health systems are struggling with epidemics of their own and are now in a more uncertain situation with this rapidly spreading infection. Frontline healthcare workers are succumbing to the infection in their efforts to save lives. There is an urgency to develop treatments for COVID-19, yet there is limited clinical data on the efficacy of potential drug treatments. Countries worldwide implemented a stay-at-home order to “flatten the curve” and relieve the pressure on the health system, but it is uncertain how this will unfold after the economy reopens. Trehalose, a natural glucose disaccharide, is known to impair viral function through the autophagy system. Here, we propose trehalose as a potential preventative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. © Copyright © 2020 Martinon, Borges, Gomez and Shimada. autophagy; COVID-19; prophylaxis; SARS-CoV-2; trehalose interleukin 1beta; peptides and proteins; transcription factor eb; trehalose; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; trehalose; adult respiratory distress syndrome; autophagy (cellular); clinical trial (topic); contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; cross presentation; cytokine release; cytokine storm; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; herd immunity; human; infection control; nonhuman; quarantine; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; virus replication; virus transmission; adult; aged; asymptomatic disease; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; child; Coronavirus infection; drug effect; middle aged; pandemic; physiology; post exposure prophylaxis; pre-exposure prophylaxis; procedures; virology; virus pneumonia; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Asymptomatic Diseases; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Post-Exposure Prophylaxis; Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis; Trehalose; Virus Replication COVID-19: Emergence of Infectious Diseases, Nanotechnology Aspects, Challenges, and Future Perspectives Wuhan, a city of China, is the epicenter for the pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses. The antiviral drugs and their clinical advances, along with herbal medicines for viral inhibition and immunity boosters, are described.

There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In developing economies and regions, the pandemic's disruption of the agriculture commodity supply chain has made it difficult for smallholder farmers to exist. Smallholder farmer's traditional struggles have worsened. However, technology may provide promise of improving conditions for vulnerable farmers even in a period of crises such as the COVID-19 period. In this article, we draw on lessons learned in developed and developing countries to propose critical digital transformation for building a resilient and sustainable post-COVID-19 supply chains for developing countries, especially for smallholder farmers operating in global value chains. We discuss how digital technologies and specifically digital inclusion of smallholder farmers can prevent major disruptions from damaging the livelihoods of society's most vulnerable. We discuss feasibility and provide some caveats for a post-COVID-19 digital inclusion in developing countries. © 1973-2011 IEEE.

[Qual será o impacto da pandemia do novo coronavirus (COVID-19) na agricultura, segurança alimentar e setores de produção animal] The whole world is in a great danger due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In December 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 took place in Wuhan, China and then rapidly spread all over the world. The current study provides potential expectations for the adverse impact of (COVID-19). The global infection affected globe on agricultural level such as agriculture, food supplies and animal production sectors. Till today, 29th April 2020, there is no vaccine available for treating novel coronavirus, consequently, the outbreak resulted in closing borders and reducing production following social distancing measures. This short communication illustrates the possible implications and expected outcomes of the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) on agricultural, food security, integrated pest management (IPM), animal productivity; and it predicts, as well, the possible adverse impacts on the economy worldwide. Brazil has one of the most important tropical agriculture in the world, being a leader in soybean production in the world. This chain impacts others such as meat and eggs. The impact of COVID-19 will be positive, encouraging the country to consolidate its leadership in the world market, stimulating exports, the machinery, inputs and fertilizers market, as well as generating employment and income in the country. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Uberlandia.

There is a significant possibility that economic stagnation would push a large population back into poverty. In the present study, we have reviewed the chronology and epidemiology of COVID-19 in Bangladesh and investigated the country's vulnerabilities concerning COVID-19 impacts. We focused primarily on four areas of vulnerabilities in Bangladesh: The garment industry, urban slums, social exclusion, and pre-existing health conditions. The result implicated that the country would take time to recover its economy due to the vulnerabilities mentioned above, and many people in Bangladesh would not be able to tolerate the current situation because they do not have enough reserves to do so. We concluded that if at least some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) had been at least partly attained, the situation would not be as dire as it is now. Based on this conclusion, we suggested a tolerance capacity to indicate how long people can survive without outside support. It is a holistic assessment rather than the indicators presently defined in each SDG, but it should be attained through a harmonized approach to SDGs. © 2020 by the authors.

The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)–B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Chronic diseases; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Immune deficiency; Pandemic; Pollutants; SARS-CoV-2; Xenobiotics angiotensin converting enzyme 2; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; fossil fuel; heavy metal; multi walled nanotube; pesticide; xenobiotic agent; antivirus agent; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; airborne particle; Article; biochemistry; biophysics; cell function; cell level; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; dietary supplement; economic aspect; human; immune deficiency; immune system; immunopathology; immunotoxicity; intestine flora; ionizing radiation; lifestyle; long term exposure; macrophage; pandemic; particulate matter; pollutant; prevalence; protein expression; public health; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; ultraviolet B radiation; virus immunity; vulnerable population; air pollutant; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diet; drug effect; epidemic; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; time; toxicity; virus pneumonia; Air Pollutants; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diet; Epidemics; Humans; Immune System; Pandemics; Pesticides; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Time; Xenobiotics COVID-19 healthcare planning: Predicting mortality and the role of the herd immunity barrier in the general population Using a mathematical model for COVID-19 incorporating data on excess of mortality compared to the corresponding period of the previous year obtained from the daily monitoring of mortality in Spain (MoMo), the prediction of total number of casualties in Spain for the first outbreak has been computed. From this figure, and following a stepwise meta-analysis of available reports, the case fatality rate (CFR) and the infectious case fatality rate (IFR) for the outbreak have been estimated. As the impact of age on these rates is notable, it is proposed to include an age-related adjusted fatality ratio in future comparative analyses between studies, calculated by adjusting the results by risk ratio to a reference age band (e.g., 60-69). From the casualty figures, and the corresponding CFR and IFR ratios, the forecast of serologically positive cases in the general Spanish population has been estimated at approximately 1% (0.87-1.3%) of the samples. If the data are confirmed by the ongoing study of the Carlos III Institute, until a vaccine is found, the immunity acquired in the general population after the infectious outbreak is far from the 65-70% herd immunity required as a barrier for COVID-19. © 2020 by the authors.

Human coronaviruses normally cause no or mild respiratory disease but in the past two decades, potentially fatal coronavirus infections have emerged, causing respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis. These include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), followed by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and recently the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, most COVID-19 patients receive traditional supportive care including breathing assistance. To halt the ongoing spread of the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and rescue individual patients, established drugs and new therapies are under evaluation. Since it will be some time until a safe and effective vaccine will be available, the immediate priority is to harness innate immunity to accelerate early antiviral immune responses. Second, since excessive inflammation is a major cause of pathology, targeted anti-inflammatory responses are being evaluated to reduce inflammation-induced damage to the respiratory tract and cytokine storms. Here, we highlight prominent immunotherapies at various stages of development that aim for augmented anti-coronavirus immunity and reduction of pathological inflammation. © 2020 The Authors.

We have developed an epidemic progression model involving the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamics, the age-stratified disease transmissibility, and the possible large-scale undocumented (i.e., asymptomatic and/or untested) transmission of COVID-19 taking place in the USA. Our analysis utilizes COVID-19 observational data in the USA between March 19 and 28, corresponding to the early stage of the epidemic when the impacts of social distancing on disease progression were yet to manifest. Calibrating our model using epidemiological data from this time period enabled us to unbiasedly address the question ""How long and with what intensity does the USA need to implement social distancing intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic?""For a short (i.e., up to two weeks) duration, we find a near-linear decrease in hospital beds demand with increasing intensity (φ) of social distancing. For a duration longer than two weeks, our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. Long-term implementation of strict social distancing with φ > 50 % could lead to the emergence of a second wave of infections due to a large residual susceptible population which highlights the need for contact tracing and isolation before re-opening of the economy. Finally, we investigate the scenario of intermittent social distancing and find an optimal social-to-no-distancing duration ratio of 5:1 corresponding to a sustainable reduction in medical demands. © 2020 Author(s).  algorithm; Betacoronavirus; calibration; Coronavirus infection; disease exacerbation; epidemic; hospitalization; human; medical informatics; pandemic; quarantine; social isolation; theoretical model; United States; virus pneumonia; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Calibration; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Epidemics; Hospitalization; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health Informatics; Quarantine; Social Isolation; United States Three months of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis The pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2019), reminiscent of the 2002-SARS-CoV outbreak, has completely isolated countries, disrupted health systems and partially paralyzed international trade and travel. In order to be better equipped to anticipate transmission of this virus to new regions, it is imperative to track the progress of the virus over time. This review analyses information on progression of the pandemic in the past 3 months and systematically discusses the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2019 virus including its epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, and clinical manifestations. Furthermore, the review also encompasses some recently proposed conceptual models that estimate the spread of this disease based on the basic reproductive number for better prevention and control procedures. Finally, we shed light on how the virus has endangered the global economy, impacting it both from the supply and demand side. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd ACE-2; COVID-19; mathematical modeling; pandemic; SARS-CoV alpha interferon; arbidol; chloroquine; favipiravir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; oseltamivir; remdesivir; ribavirin; antivirus agent; antibody detection; antigen detection; basic reproduction number; clinical feature; computer model; conceptual model; coronavirus disease 2019; genome analysis; human; meta analysis; pandemic; pathophysiology; physical disease by body function; prevention and control; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus classification; virus morphology; virus transmission; adaptive immunity; Betacoronavirus; classification; commercial phenomena; Coronavirus infection; economics; genetics; laboratory technique; pandemic; pathogenicity; physiology; theoretical model; virology; virus genome; virus pneumonia; virus replication; Adaptive Immunity; Antiviral Agents; Basic Reproduction Number; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Commerce; Coronavirus Infections; Economics; Genome, Viral; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Replication COVID-19 Outbreak: An Overview Background: In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Summary: A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures. © 2020 S.

In this century, it is the worst threat to international health and the economy. After 4 months of COVID-19 outbreak, there is no certain and approved medicine against it. In this public health emergency, it makes sense to investigate the possible effects of old drugs and find drug repositioning that is efficient, economical, and riskless process. Old drugs that may be effective are from different pharmacological categories, antimalarials, anthelmintics, anti-protozoal, anti-HIVs, anti-influenza, anti-hepacivirus, antineoplastics, neutralizing antibodies, immunoglobulins, and interferons. In vitro, in vivo, or preliminary trials of these drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 have been encouraging, leading to new research projects and trials to find the best drug/s. In this review, we discuss the possible mechanisms of these drugs against COVID-19. Also, it should be mentioned that in this manuscript, we discuss preliminary rationales; however, clinical trial evidence is needed to prove them. COVID-19 therapy must be based on expert clinical experience and published literature and guidelines from major health organizations. Moreover, herein, we describe current evidence that may be changed in the future. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

There are few reports on factors influencing the transmission of 2019-nCoV, such as environmental conditions (humidity and temperature), air pollution, and human activities. It is difficult to sample and research 2019-nCoV directly. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the factors influencing the spread and survival of other similar viruses, which is instructional for the prevention of epidemics and the control of 2019-nCoV transmission. The results show that: (1) Low temperature and low humidity could prolong the lifetime and increase the transmission of coronavirus, especially on dry surfaces. For example, coronavirus can survive on a smooth surface at a temperature of 22-25 ℃ and a relative humidity (RH) of 40%-45% for more than 5 days. (2) Similarly, the survival rates of the aerosolized coronavirus is also high in a closed environment at low temperature and low humidity, 2019-nCoV may hold high survival rates at a temperature of 20-25 ℃ and a relative humidity of 30%-50%. (3) The higher the particle concentration, the risk of 2019-nCoV transmission may increase. (4) The behavior of infected people also plays a important role in the transmission of 2019-nCoV. The transmission of virus can be reduced by avoiding sneezing and coughing in the crowd, and blocking the transmission of droplets using hands, elbows or other objects. Considering the above analysis, some suggestions for the prevention and control the epidemics are made, such as improving the indoor microenvironment, investigating the detection, inactivation, influence factors and propagation characteristics of 2019-nCoV. © 2020, Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

The study is developed within a multiscale framework accounting for the interaction of different spatial scales, from the small scale of the virus itself and cells, to the large scale of individuals and further up to the collective behaviour of populations. An interdisciplinary vision is developed thanks to the contributions of epidemiologists, immunologists and economists as well as those of mathematical modellers. The first part of the contents is devoted to understanding the complex features of the system and to the design of a modelling rationale. The modelling approach is treated in the second part of the paper by showing both how the virus propagates into infected individuals, successfully and not successfully recovered, and also the spatial patterns, which are subsequently studied by kinetic and lattice models. The third part reports the contribution of research in the fields of virology, epidemiology, immune competition, and economy focussed also on social behaviours. Finally, a critical analysis is proposed looking ahead to research perspectives. © 2020 The Author(s). complexity; COVID-19; immune competition; intracellular infection dynamics; living systems; multiscale problems; networks; SARS-CoV-2; spatial patterns; viral quasispecies; virus structure modelling Economics; Viruses; Collective behaviour; Critical analysis; Lattice models; Multi-scale frameworks; Multi-scale Modeling; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Social behaviour; Spatial patterns; Diseases Research on intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics [面向重大疫情应急防控的智能机器人系统研究] In recent years, SARS virus, MERS coronavirus, and other global pandemics have occurred frequently. The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused more than 3.7 million infected people and 260000 deaths over 210 countries around the world from December 2019 to May 7, 2020, which has seriously affected the safety of people, the stability of social order, and the development of the economy. Therefore, it is urgent to explore and implement new prevention and control programs for such major pandemics. With the development of robots and artificial intelligence technologies, various intelligent robots for emergency prevention and control in complex conditions have emerged, and they have played paramount roles in disease prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing. Based on the problems of insufficient supply of materials and heavy disinfection tasks during the prevention and control of major outbreaks, we study the systematic procedures and applications of medical material handling robots, multi-scene disinfection robots, medical assistant robots, prevention and control robots, and production resumption robots. Moreover, we comparatively analyze the current situation of key technologies of pandemic emergency prevention and control robots, such as environmental perception, autonomous navigation, motion planning, and 5G communication technology. In conclusion, we put forward a technical prospect of intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics. © 2020, Science Press.

The virus uses its spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain to interact with host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) sites to initiate a cascade of events that culminate in severe acute respiratory syndrome in some individuals. In efforts to curtail viral spread, authorities initiated far-reaching lockdowns that have disrupted global economies. The scientific and medical communities are mounting serious efforts to limit this pandemic and subsequent waves of viral spread by developing preventative vaccines and repurposing existing drugs as potential therapies. In this review, we focus on the latest developments in COVID-19 vaccine development, including results of the first Phase I clinical trials and describe a number of the early candidates that are emerging in the field. We seek to provide a balanced coverage of the seven main platforms used in vaccine development that will lead to a desired target product profile for the “ideal” vaccine. Using tales of past vaccine discovery efforts that have taken many years or that have failed, we temper over exuberant enthusiasm with cautious optimism that the global medical community will reach the elusive target to treat COVID-19 and end the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Funk, Laferrière and Ardakani. clinical trial; coronavirus; COVID-19; immune response; public health; SARS-CoV-2; vaccine advac; azd 1222; bnt 162; coronavac; coronavirus spike glycoprotein; COVID 19 vaccine; DNA vaccine; inactivated virus vaccine; ino 4800; live vaccine; messenger RNA 1273; nvxcov 237; nvxcov 2373; per.c6; placebo; recombinant protein; RNA vaccine; scb 2019; unclassified drug; coronavirus disease 2019; drug design; drug research; drug targeting; human; Human adenovirus 5; molecular diagnosis; pandemic; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; symptomatology; treatment indication; vaccination; virus genome; virus transmission Chemistry and Biology of SARS-CoV-2 Challenges and opportunities: • The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has changed our world in just half a year: a large number of people have died from the virus-induced pneumonia COVID-19, and the global economy is at an unprecedented low with unknown near- and long-term consequences. • The coronavirus pandemic needs a two-pronged approach: a short-term solution to find a drug to treat the massive number of seriously ill patients, and long-term development of preventive and curative drugs for future corona outbreaks. • De novo drug discovery takes years to move from idea and/or pre-clinic to market release and is not a short-term solution for the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Drug repurposing is perhaps the only short-term solution, and vaccination is a middle-term solution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV or Wuhan coronavirus) caused an unprecedented fast-spreading worldwide pandemic. Although currently with a rather low mortality rate, the virus spread rapidly over the world using the modern world's traffic highways. The coronavirus (CoV) family members were responsible for several deadly outbreaks and epidemics during the last decade. Not only governments but also the scientific community reacted promptly to the outbreak, and information is shared quickly. For example, the genetic fingerprint was shared, and the 3D structure of key proteins was rapidly solved, which can be used for the discovery of potential treatments. An overview is given on the current knowledge of the spread, disease course, and molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2. We discuss potential treatment developments in the context of recent outbreaks, drug repurposing, and development timelines. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.This perspective covers the chemistry and biology of SARS-CoV-2 and potential pharmacological interventions of the coronavirus pandemic, including discussion of the different drug modalities such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies, small-molecule drugs, or natural medicines (e.g., traditional Chinese medicine [TCM]).

A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including patient quarantine and mass “social distancing” measures. Although the clinical manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide. Given the clinical insights into CoVID-19 and the challenges presented in this review for the U.S. rural population, mitigation strategies should be designed accordingly to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this contagion. © 2020 by the authors.

Despite all resources employed to counteract the spreading of the virus, additional global strategies are needed to handle the related mental health issues. Methods: Published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak and other previous global infections have been considered and reviewed. Comments: This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally. Collective concerns influence daily behaviors, economy, prevention strategies and decision-making from policy makers, health organizations and medical centers, which can weaken strategies of COVID-19 control and lead to more morbidity and mental health needs at global level. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus; COVID-19; mental health; Outbreak Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; global health; human; mental health; pandemic; pathogenicity; psychology; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Covid-19 pandemic by the “real-time” monitoring: the Tunisian case and lessons for global epidemics in the context of 3PM strategies Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by. Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable “real-time” monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach. © 2020, The Author(s).

Given the extent of the current pandemic (people in over one hundred countries infected) and its disastrous effect on world economy (associated with limitations of human rights), speedy drug discovery is critical. In this situation, past investments into the development of new (animal-free) approach methods (NAM) for drug safety, efficacy, and quality evaluation can be leveraged. For this, we provide an overview of repurposing ideas to shortcut drug development times. Animal-based testing would be too lengthy, and it largely fails, when a pathogen is species-specific or if the desired drug is based on specific features of human biology. Fortunately, industry has already largely shifted to NAM, and some public funding programs have advanced the development of animal-free technologies. For instance, NAM can predict genotoxicity (a major aspect of carcinogenicity) within days, human antibodies targeting virus epitopes can be generated in molecular biology laboratories within weeks, and various human cell-based organoids are available to test virus infectivity and the biological processes controlling them. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has formed an expert group to pave the way for the use of such approaches for accelerated drug development. This situation illustrates the importance of diversification in drug discovery strategies and clearly shows the shortcomings of an approach that invests 95% of resources into a single technology (animal experimentation) in the face of challenges that require alternative approaches. © 2020, The Author(s).  antivirus agent; virus vaccine; antivirus agent; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; combination drug therapy; coronavirus disease 2019; drug approval; drug development; drug efficacy; drug quality; drug repositioning; drug research; drug safety; Editorial; European Medicines Agency; genotoxicity; investment; new (animal free) approach method; priority journal; quality control; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; animal testing alternative; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; drug development; human; pandemic; preclinical study; procedures; virus pneumonia; Animal Testing Alternatives; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Development; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug Repositioning; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Viral Vaccines Biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus COVID-19 The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to the international health system and economy. This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750,890 people worldwide, resulting in 36,405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender over 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R2 = 0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing, and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics. © 2020 The Authors 2019-nCoV; Biological trends; Coronavirus; Covid-2019; Outbreak; Prevalence  Modelling the Economic Impact and Ripple Effects of Disease Outbreaks The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has had alarming effects on human lives and the economies of affected countries. With the world’s manufacturing hubs experiencing a period of extended factory closures, the economic impact transcends territorial borders via global supply chains. This paper provides a roadmap on how to evaluate the vulnerability that cascades through the supply chain due to a disease outbreak at the firm level, national level, and global scale. The final extent of losses is not yet known, but the development of economic models combined with epidemiological models and network analysis techniques can yield more realistic estimates to select appropriate strategies in a timely manner. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

The surging number of deaths every day, global lockdown and travel restrictions have resulted in huge losses to society. The impact is massive and will leave a historical footprint. The Spanish Flu of 1918, which was the last pandemic that had a similar impact, was shadowed under the consequences of World War I. All the brilliance, strength and economies of countries worldwide are aimed at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The knowledge about coronavirus dynamics, its nature and epidemiology are expanding every day. The present review aims to summarize the structure, epidemiology, symptoms, statistical status of the disease status, intervention strategies and deliberates the lessons learnt during the pandemic. The intervention approaches, antiviral drug repurposing and vaccine trials are intensified now. Statistical interpretations of disease dynamics and their projections may help the decision-makers. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2  A review on sars-cov-2 virology, pathophysiology, animal models, and anti-viral interventions Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic and transmissible CoV that is presently plaguing the global human population and economy. No proven effective antiviral therapy or vaccine currently exists, and supportive care remains to be the cornerstone treatment. Through previous lessons learned from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV studies, scientific groups worldwide have rapidly expanded the knowledge pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 virology that includes in vitro and in vivo models for testing of antiviral therapies and randomized clinical trials. In the present narrative, we review SARS-CoV-2 virology, clinical features, pathophysiology, and animal models with a specific focus on the antiviral and adjunctive therapies currently being tested or that require testing in animal models and randomized clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 2019-CoV; coronavirus; COVID-19; MERS; potential interventions; SARS alpha tocopherol; antivirus agent; ascorbic acid; chloroquine; cinanserin; cyclosporine; diarylheptanoid derivative; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; emodin; flavonoid; immunoglobulin; interferon; iron; lopinavir plus ritonavir; monoclonal antibody; nelfinavir; nicotianamine; omega 3 fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; promazine; proteinase inhibitor; remdesivir; retinol; ribavirin; selenium; thymopentin; thymosin alpha1; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; vitamin B group; zinc; COVID-19; immunologic factor; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; trace element; virus vaccine; vitamin; antiviral therapy; China; Chinese medicine; coronavirus disease 2019; coronavirus disease 2019; diet therapy; human; infection control; nonhuman; Review; SARS coronavirus; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; virus infection; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus infection; nutritional status; passive immunization; pathogenicity; plasma; virus pneumonia; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Immunologic Factors; Nutritional Status; Plasma; Pneumonia, Viral; Trace Elements; Viral Vaccines; Vitamins Novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): A lesson from animal coronaviruses The recent pandemic caused by the novel human coronavirus, referrred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), not only is having a great impact on the health care systems and economies in all continents but it is also causing radical changes of common habits and life styles. The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown. However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features. A full comprehension of the mechanisms driving the evolution of animal CoVs will help better understand the emergence, spreading, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 The Authors Animal coronaviruses; COVID-19; Genetic plasticity; Host switch; Novel human coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Tissue tropism case report; clinical article; comprehension; coronavirus disease 2019; human; nonhuman; review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tropism; animal; Betacoronavirus; classification; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus infection; disease model; genetics; isolation and purification; molecular evolution; pandemic; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Zoonoses Factors influencing the epidemiological characteristics of pandemic COVID 19: A TISM approach The COVID 19 is a pandemic having an epidemic nature influencing the human health and economy in a global level. The major limitation to overcome the issue is the lack of potential vaccines or effective medicines to treat or control the disease. Considering the shortness of time to act, the purpose of the paper was to identify and categorise the climatic, socio-biological factors that influence the global super-spread of the epidemic using a theory building approach, ‘Total Interpretive Structural Modelling’ (TISM). MICMAC analysis of the identified factors, based on their interdependence categorized the triggering factors, air temperature, humidity, age, airflow and ventilation, responsible for the increased mortality rate of COVID 19 compared to SARS and MERS. So the model explains why the temperate countries of similar climatic zones and aged people are more vulnerable. It also predicts the susceptibility of countries based on their geographic locations and upcoming climatic conditions which were found to be influential in sustaining longevity and aerosol spread of the virus. Since many of these factors remain unaltered or out of human control, the linkage factors identified in this paper; change in host behaviour and number of contacts can be given priorities in order to overcome the situation. Furthermore, this is the first attempt made to understand epidemiological characteristics of COVID 19 using TISM approach. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The disease has rapidly acquired a pandemic status affecting almost all populated areas of the planet. The causative agent of COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. The virus has an approximate 30 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, which is 74.5% to 99% identical to that of SARS-CoV, CoV-pangolin, and the coronavirus the from horseshoe bat. According to available information, SARS-CoV-2 is inferred to be a recombinant virus that originated from bats and was transmitted to humans, possibly using the pangolin as the intermediate host. The interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, and its subsequent cleavage by serine protease and fusion, are the main events in the pathophysiology. The serine protease inhibitors, spike protein-based vaccines, or ACE2 blockers may have therapeutic potential in the near future. At present, no vaccine is available against COVID-19. The disease is being treated with antiviral, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, herbal medicines, and active plasma antibodies. In this context, the present review article provides a cumulative account of the recent information regarding the viral characteristics, potential therapeutic targets, treatment options, and prospective research questions. © 2020 by the authors.

Originating in China, the disease has a rapid progression to other countries. Research suggests remarkable genomic resemblance of 2019-nCoV with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which has a history of a pandemic in 2002. With evidence of nosocomial spread, a number of diligent measures are being employed to constrain its propagation. Hence, the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been established by the World Health Organization (WHO) with strategic objectives for public health to curtail its impact on global health and economy. © 2020 The Authors Infectious disease; Novel coronavirus; Pandemic; Public health; Zoonotic transmission lopinavir; remdesivir; ritonavir; virus vaccine; virus vector; adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; China; coronavirus disease 2019; coughing; dyspnea; epidemic; fever; genomics; global health; heart injury; human; incubation time; international health regulation; Middle East respiratory syndrome; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality rate; nonhuman; oxygen therapy; pandemic; Pholidota (animal); priority journal; SARS coronavirus; secondary infection; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; virus transmission; World Health Organization; x-ray computed tomography; animal; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; global health; pandemic; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; China; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Global Health; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Zoonoses The first 75 days of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak: Recent advances, prevention, and treatment The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously known as 2019-nCoV) outbreak has engulfed an unprepared world amidst a festive season. The zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, believed to have originated from infected bats, is the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus. Specifically, the overall genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to that of bat coronavirus termed BatCoV RaTG13. Although the current mortality rate of 2% is significantly lower than that of SARS (9.6%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (35%), SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and transmissible from human to human with an incubation period of up to 24 days. Some statistical studies have shown that, on average, one infected patient may lead to a subsequent 5.7 confirmed cases. Since the first reported case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, China, there has been a total of 60,412 confirmed cases with 1370 fatalities reported in 25 different countries as of February 13, 2020. The outbreak has led to severe impacts on social health and the economy at various levels. This paper is a review of the significant, continuous global effort that was made to respond to the outbreak in the first 75 days. Although no vaccines have been discovered yet, a series of containment measures have been implemented by various governments, especially in China, in the effort to prevent further outbreak, whilst various medical treatment approaches have been used to successfully treat infected patients. On the basis of current studies, it would appear that the combined antiviral treatment has shown the highest success rate. This review aims to critically summarize the most recent advances in understanding the coronavirus, as well as the strategies in prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has shown how fragile our global preparedness for infectious diseases is. The world is a small-connected globe with short travel time between its remote parts. COVID-19 has spread globally and swiftly with major impacts on health, economy, and quality of life of communities. At this point in the time, April 9, 2020, >1,500,000 patients have been infected and >88,000 patients have died worldwide within the last 3 months. The status is evolving and the costly lessons learned over time are increasing. These lessons are global as this virus is. They involve different domains of health sciences including virology, public health, clinical, critical care, and disaster management. This review addresses our current knowledge of COVID-19 pandemic from the basic virology and transmission, through prevention, infection control, clinical management, and finally disaster management including the recovery period. This review has a multidisciplinary approach, which is needed at this time. After this difficult period passes, we have to carry the lessons we learned for the future so that we can be better prepared. One thing that has clearly emerged from this ongoing crisis is that infectious diseases have no borders and we have to work together, using the one world, one health approach, if we are to minimize the enormous impact such pandemics can cause. © 2019 Turkish Journal of Emergency Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

This has led to a significant impact on the lives and economy in China and other countries. Here we develop a discrete-time stochastic epidemic model with binomial distributions to study the transmission of the disease. Model parameters are estimated on the basis of fitting to newly reported data from January 11 to February 13, 2020 in China. The estimates of the contact rate and the effective reproductive number support the efficiency of the control measures that have been implemented so far. Simulations show the newly confirmed cases will continue to decline and the total confirmed cases will reach the peak around the end of February of 2020 under the current control measures. The impact of the timing of returning to work is also evaluated on the disease transmission given different strength of protection and control measures. © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

This virus has been found to have striking similarity with the SARS CoV, which caused an epidemic earlier. Symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnoea, and rarely vomit-ing and diarrhoea. Diagnostic with the help of serological and molecular meth-ods are currently possible, along with CT scans and Chest X Rays for the early detection. Bioinformatics tools are now helping us in mapping the infection dynamics with increased accuracy and are helping us establish a chain of pro-gression of the virus. With research rapidly expanding, new facts have come into the focus and WHO has started a SOLIDARITY program, which helps in randomised drug trials with better validity aided by measures taken by WHO and use of technology.Nevertheless, novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is one of the deadliest viruses’ humanity has encountered, causing not just biological, but also impacting the world economy. This review has all the information about COVID-19 such as its virology, epidemiology, clinical aspects, diagno-sis, possible treatment, and prevention. This study also emphasised on the future direction that could be computational drug screening & vaccine design-ing using Immunoinformatics approach to save time and cost to come out with potential treatments. Drug screening from cell lines and plasma therapy may prove highly effective to treat COVID-19 patients. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences. 2019-nCoV; Bioinformatics; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2  Perspectives on monoclonal antibody therapy as potential therapeutic intervention for Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) Last decade witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens including Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and more recently novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2). The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen. © 2020, Allergy and Immunology Society of Thailand.

The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age. These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe. Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article. The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older. The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index ≥40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment. Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions. While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million. That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots. For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy. The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19? (2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made? (3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been? and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus? The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy. Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward. The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to ""shelter in place,"" quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to ""flatten the curve"" by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it. However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy. Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity. Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population. Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously - and perhaps even more vigorously - focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year. Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is - and other countries are - from developing effective community immunity. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

As the sudden emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is endangering global health and the economy, the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. At present, various diagnostic kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 are available for use to initiate appropriate treatment faster and to limit further spread of the virus. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 or potential clinical benefits. In addition, institutions and companies worldwide are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines against COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine has yet been specifically approved for COVID-19. Given the urgency of the outbreak, we focus here on recent advances in the diagnostics, treatment, and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to guide strategies to address the current COVID-19 pandemic. © The author(s).

Such public safety infectious disease includes influences great pressure on the national economy. At present, some countries and regions in the world are still in epidemic situation, and there is an urgent need to judge the infection situation and travel risk in the region. In a relatively fine scale down to perceive the surrounding situation, and then rational zoning decisions to promote the resumption of production and work. In this study, indicators for the evaluation of COVID-19 epidemic were constructed using multi-sourced data. A computational evaluation of 736 fine-grained grids was performed using the GeoDetector model and the decision tree model. The study found that the risk level in older neighborhoods was much higher than in newer neighborhoods; the population density was the most important determinant of infection; the number of urban people slumped to 37% of that in usual times according to Tencent data after the 'city closure'; The model this paper used portrays the major factor in defining low-risk areas and high-risk areas, and offers suggestions and assessment from a geographical perspective to fight COVID-19, thus presenting great practical value. © 2013 IEEE.

As on date, around 8.20 million confirmed cases including death of around 443,815 have been reported. The present review deals with the history and origin of the COVID-19, its worldwide pandemic spread, symptoms and preventive measures as an attempt to create awareness of the fatal disease. © 2020 Deuton-X Ltd.

Corona; COVID-19; Global pandemic; Virus  COVID-19 India: An insight into the impact of lockdown and community behavioural response The emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases pose a threat to the global economy. The tendency to confront these pandemics is still questionable. In January 2020, the first case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in India was identified in Kerala. Later, the Indian government announced lockdown as a remedial action against COVID-19. The present work aims to elucidate the community behavioural response towards COVID-19 lockdown in India and presents comprehensive observations. Protection motivational theory has been used to build a conceptual framework. It was observed that community behavioural response includes maladaptive, adaptive and prosocial behaviours. In addition, we conclude that the effective strategy against the prevention, spread and control of pandemics and strategic management is still lacking. Hence, we propose a framework based on the learnings from COVID-19 to tackle future pandemics. © The Author(s) 2020.

With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the main strategy to contain the pandemic. Unprecedented global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders are causing the most severe disruption of the global economy since World War II. With international travel bans affecting over 90% of the world population and wide-spread restrictions on public gatherings and community mobility, tourism largely ceased in March 2020. Early evidence on impacts on air travel, cruises, and accommodations have been devastating. While highly uncertain, early projections from UNWTO for 2020 suggest international arrivals could decline by 20 to 30% relative to 2019. Tourism is especially susceptible to measures to counteract pandemics because of restricted mobility and social distancing. The paper compares the impacts of COVID-19 to previous epidemic/pandemics and other types of global crises and explores how the pandemic may change society, the economy, and tourism. It discusses why COVID-19 is an analogue to the ongoing climate crisis, and why there is a need to question the volume growth tourism model advocated by UNWTO, ICAO, CLIA, WTTC and other tourism organizations. © 2020 The Author(s).

As of May 8th, 2020, in India, 56,342 positive cases have been reported. India, with a population of more than 1.34 billion—the second largest population in the world—will have difficulty in controlling the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among its population. Multiple strategies would be highly necessary to handle the current outbreak; these include computational modeling, statistical tools, and quantitative analyses to control the spread as well as the rapid development of a new treatment. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has raised awareness about the recent outbreak and has taken necessary actions to control the spread of COVID-19. The central and state governments are taking several measures and formulating several wartime protocols to achieve this goal. Moreover, the Indian government implemented a 55-days lockdown throughout the country that started on March 25th, 2020, to reduce the transmission of the virus. This outbreak is inextricably linked to the economy of the nation, as it has dramatically impeded industrial sectors because people worldwide are currently cautious about engaging in business in the affected regions. © 2020 Kumar, Kumar, Christopher and Doss.

This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH COVID-19; MERS; SARS; spike protein; vaccine candidate; vaccine development  Impact of COVID-19 on marital relationships-insights from South India COVID-19 has inflicted significant changes on various lifestyle dimensions of people around the world and had instilled the fear of an apocalypse in their minds. It not only killed thousands of people but also the economy of most of the countries, leaving an unforgettable trail of devastation. COVID-19 also had a positive impact on nature as it was seen reclaiming itself due to the decrease in all kinds of pollution. It also brought families together in the form of a nation-wide lock down. Most of them were confined to the four walls of their homes. They had a chance to spend more time together, leading to better understanding, which in turn had an impact on the relationships between family members. Families are rooted on strong marital relationships and given that a pandemic of such a nature is the first of its kind in this century, it would be interesting to examine how the contextual changes induced by COVID-19 had impacted the marital relationships of individuals. A sample of 165 married respondents from Tamilnadu, the Southern-most state of India, were considered for the study. Marital Satisfaction and its antecedents were assessed on a 22-item likert scale. Statistical analysis revealed that interpersonal factors and sexual factors emerged as significant predictors of marital satisfaction. The study found that COVID-19 had an impact on the mindsets of people. Respondents in the green and orange zone, where there was a negligible incidence of COVID-19 had reported higher levels of marital satisfaction compared to the red zone, where there was the highest incidence of COVID-19 infections. This study has important implications with respect to the change in perceptions of people towards marital relationships, when they are exposed to a pandemic like COVID-19. © 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

It can manifest with a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic cases to pneumonia or even fatality. One of the treatments suggested is convalescent plasma therapy. The study aims at assessing the general awareness about Covid-19 and knowledge about the role of Convalescent plasma therapy for treatment of Covid-19 among post graduate dental students. The survey was conducted among postgraduate dental students through an online survey tool using google forms. The survey was conducted online among postgraduate dental students on the go with 19 and convalescent plasma therapy.A total of 103 participant were included in the study. The responses were collected, tabulated and analysed using SPSS software. The knowledge regarding covid-19 and the awareness about the usefulness of convalescent plasma was variable. Around 90% of the participants were aware of the effectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy. Advance training, proper PPE and training on handling the patients with any infectious disease should be dealt with in detail for reducing the spread from dental clinics and dentists. © 2020 Global Research Online.

In India, it has become a public health disaster and its' intensity increasing continuously. For the disaster risk reduction, and capacity building against the COVID-19 pandemic understanding of the relationship between socio-environmental conditions with the pandemic is very necessary. The objective of the present work is to construct a socio-environmental vulnerability index of the potential risk of community spread of COVID-19 using socio-economic and environmental variables. Methodology: In this, cross-sectional study principal component analyses have been used to drive SoEVI. 4 uncorrelated sub-index has been extracted from 16 sub-indicators which reflects 59% of the variance. Aggregation of 4 Sub-Index has been done to obtain the final vulnerability Index. Results: Results show that there is spatial variability in vulnerability based on environmental and socio-economic conditions. Districts of north and central India found more vulnerable then south India. Statistical significance has been tested using regression analysis, positive relation has been found between vulnerability index and confirmed and active cases. Conclusion: The vulnerability index has highlighted environmentaly and socioeconomicallybackward districts. These areas will suffer more critical problems against COVID-19 pandemic for their socio-environmental problem. © 2020 INDIACLEN Community risk; Composite index; COVID-19; Pandemic; Vulnerability  Environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic–a lesson for the future The environment is an integral component of human and animal health. COVID-19 is a global health challenge in the twenty-first century. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and its spread to regional countries and nowadays affecting more than 210 countries worldwide represents the first pandemic in history to be caused by a coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic has huge impacts on most aspects of human activities, as well as on the economy and health care systems. Lock-downs, quarantines and border closures in the wake of the pandemic have led to reductions in air pollution through decreased travel and production. These positive environmental effects are likely mostly temporary, but may serve as an example that changes in our way of life can have prompt positive effects for the environment and demonstrate the usefulness of travel-reducing measures such as teleconferencing. Thus, acknowledging that COVID-19 is first and foremost a global disaster, the pandemic may inspire to future behavioral changes with positive environmental effects. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

As these measures are exhausted, non-COVID-19 related issues such as those associated with the mental and physical well-being of people under lockdowns became an emerging concern. As these issues are evident, not to mention the economic downturn, governments are currently looking at designing lockdown relaxation efforts by simultaneously considering both public health and economic restart. Without documented experiences to rely on, governments are resorting to trial-and-error approach in creating a lockdown exit strategy while preventing succeeding waves of cases that may overwhelm healthcare facilities. Thus, this work pioneers the use of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets along with the domain of public health and the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The DEMATEL handles the intertwined causal relationships among guideline protocols for the relaxation strategy. The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory addresses the vagueness and uncertainty of human judgments in the context of the DEMATEL. A case study of the Philippine government response for the lockdown exit is presented to evaluate the applicability of the proposed method. Findings reveal that compliance of minimum public health standards, limited movement of persons, suspension of physical classes, the prohibition of mass gatherings, non-operation of category IV industries, and non-operation of hotels or similar establishments are the most crucial protocols for such strategy. These findings offer practical insights for the government to allocate resources and impose measures to ensure their implementation, as well as for developing mitigation efforts to cushion their socio-economic impacts. Policy insights and avenues for future works are also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd COVID-19; DEMATEL; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Lockdown; Pandemic; Relaxed measures  Developing a framework for enhancing survivability of sustainable supply chains during and post-COVID-19 pandemic The pandemic has created a restrictive working system including remote working, and flexible hours for the firms and employees all around the globe, thus transforming into a platform economy may reduce unemployment and enhance job opportunities. Therefore, firms are now trying to identify the ways for enhancing survivability of Sustainable Supply Chains (SSCs). This study has made an effort to develop a framework for enhancing survivability of SSCs to survive in and post-COVID-19 pandemic. This study has utilised Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method for identifying the significant factors for enhancing survivability of SSCs to be focused in pandemic situation. The study revealed that ‘Supply Chain Network Viability (SCV)’ is the main criterion for managing buyer–supplier relationship and enhancing survivability of SSCs during and post-COVID-19 situation. This study is helpful for firms, suppliers, and other stakeholders to focus on the identified factors for healthier future. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. buyer–supplier relationship; COVID-19 pandemic; digital data-driven SCs; survivability; Sustainable supply chains (SSCs); viability  Costing the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Economic Evaluation of Hypothetical Suppression Policy in the UK Objective: This study aims to cost and calculate the relative cost-effectiveness of the hypothetical suppression policies found in the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team model. Methods: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non–intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. Results: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. Conclusions: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss. Nevertheless, it would be difficult to claim that the hypothetical Imperial model–projected suppression policies are obviously cost-ineffective relative to the alternatives available. Despite evolving differences between government policy and Imperial model–projected suppression policy, it is hoped this article will provide some early insight into the trade-offs that are involved. © 2020 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research coronavirus; cost-effectiveness; COVID-19; economic evaluation; mitigation; suppression; United Kingdom  Policy response to the economic challenge from COVID-19 in India: A qualitative enquiry The recent COVID-19 pandemic has not only resulted in the loss of human lives but also distressed economies. The impact of this crisis is even higher in emerging economies like India due to already slowing growth rates, poor health infrastructure, and a significant population living in extreme poverty. While the government is taking measures to handle this crisis, nobody can be sure if these measures are adequate, as this will depend on how soon the spread of the virus is contained in the country. However, understanding the depth of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy is vital to formulate the policy and measures to contain this economic impact. This paper attempts to understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy by employing a qualitative research design, based on sentiment analysis to understand 15 industry experts' opinion concerning the socio-economic impact of COVID-19. The study makes a theoretical as well as applied contribution to the field of study. While theoretically, it contributes to the field of pandemic research, public health management, and disaster management; in an applied sense, we propose a set of measures for the policymakers based out in India, as well as in other emerging nations of the world. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd   Strategies to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic The World Health Organization declared a COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, when there were 4,293 confirmed cumulative deaths. By May 17, 2020 this number increased to 315,005. The risk of death is higher above the age of 60, but there are many deaths below 60 (for example, in Sao Paulo, 25%). Due to the lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, there are at least three types of interventions used in the first wave of this pandemic: increased alertness and hygiene (e.g. Sweden); identification and isolation of infected people and their contacts (e.g. South Korea); lockdown (e.g. Italy). These interventions are complementary. Choices of the right mix of interventions will vary from society to society and in the same society at different times. The search for a miracle drug is dangerous because it is based on the mistaken belief that any treatment option is better than ""nothing"". Brazilian society will not be able to maintain lockdown for a long period. Naturally, in the near future, regardless of the advice from scientists, doctors and authorities, commerce, services and schools will reopen. In order to implement any strategy aimed to control the pandemic and preserve the economy, the country needs leadership that centralizes and coordinates actions. Unfortunately, the Brazilian government is not fulfilling this role; on the contrary, it is a hindrance. This negative leadership and lack of coordination are causing many deaths and are severely damaging the lives of survivors by delaying the resuming of economic and social activities. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia.

Due to economic pressure, the government of India had to implement a policy of relaxing control during the rising period of the epidemic. This paper proposes a compartment model to study the development of COVID-19 in India after relaxing control. The Sigmoid function reflecting the cumulative effect is used to characterize the model-based diagnosis rate, cure rate and mortality rate. Considering the influence of the lockdown on the model parameters, the data are fitted using the method of least squares before and after the lockdown. According to numerical simulation and model analysis, the impact of India’s relaxation of control before and after the inflection point is studied. Research shows that adopting a relaxation policy prematurely will have disastrous consequences. Even if the degree of relaxation is only 5% before the inflection point, it will increase the number of deaths by 15.03%. If the control is relaxed after the inflection point, the higher degree of relaxation, the more likely a secondary outbreak will occur, which will extend the duration of the pandemic, leading to more deaths and put more pressure on the health care system. It is found that after the implementation of the relaxation policy, medical quarantine capability and public cooperation are two vital indicators. The results show that if the supply of kits and detection speed can be increased after the control is relaxed, the secondary outbreak can be effectively avoided. Meanwhile, the increase in public cooperation can significantly reduce the spread of the virus, suppress the second outbreak of the pandemic and reduce the death toll. It is of reference significance to the government’s policy formulation. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

International travel bans in March 2020 dampened viral spread and resulted in an overnight global economic crisis. As countries ease travel and social distancing restrictions, viral resurgences are expected. This study was carried out in order to delineate the development of a second wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths due to lockdown easements in June–July 2020. Methods: Publically available data for daily new cases and deaths from December 2019 to September 2020 was obtained from “Our World In Data” website and analysed with Pearson correlation. Results: At global level, both datasets exhibited three distinct time periods. Cases rose to mid-April, plateaued till mid-May then rose again. Almost all of the slopes in these three time periods were statistically significant. Deaths followed a similar three-part pattern, albeit more pronounced, with values lagging circa one week after new cases and a middle time period when numbers (of deaths) actually decreased, with all periods exhibiting significant slopes. At continent level, for new cases, Asia rose steadily, Europe is increasing again, the Americas and Africa are declining. Deaths follow a similar pattern. Oceania shows a bimodal pattern, with a first and second wave of cases shortly followed by deaths in a similar pattern. The monthly ratio of detected cases to deaths (case fatality ratio) initially rose to 0.08, then fell to 0.02. Conclusion: The world is in its second wave of COVID-19, with fortunately reduced case fatality ratios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The current study conducted a situation analysis on the pandemic preparedness of Bangladesh and provided recommendations on the transition to the new reality and gradual restoration of normalcy. Method: A complex adaptive system (CAS) framework was theorized based on four structural dimensions obtained from the crisis and complexity theory to help evaluate the health system of Bangladesh. Data sourced from published reports from the government, non-governmental organizations, and mainstream media up to June 15, 2020 were used to conduct a qualitative analysis and visualize the spatial distribution of countrywide COVID-19 cases. Results: The findings suggested that Bangladesh severely lacked the preparedness to tackle the spread of COVID-19 with both short- and long-term implications for health, the economy, and good governance. Absence of planning and coordination, disproportionate resource allocations, challenged infrastructure, adherence to bureaucratic delay, lack of synchronized risk communication, failing leadership of concerned authorities, and incoherent decision-making have led to a precarious situation that will have dire ramifications causing many uncertainties in the coming days. Conclusions: Implementation of response protocols addressing the needs of the community and the stakeholders from the central level is urgently needed. The development of mechanisms for dynamic decision-making based on regular feedback and long-term planning for a smooth transition between the new reality and normalcy should also be urgently addressed in Bangladesh. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd complexity theory; crisis theory; health system; LMIC; pandemic; SARS-COV-2; situational assessment  The Science Underlying COVID-19: Implications for the Cardiovascular System The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected health and economy worldwide on an unprecedented scale. Patients have diverse clinical outcomes, but those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and related conditions incur disproportionately worse outcome. The high infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is in part related to new mutations in the receptor binding domain, and acquisition of a furin cleavage site in the S-spike protein. The continued viral shedding in the asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals enhances its community transmission. The virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor for internalization, aided by transmembrane protease serine 2 protease. The tissue localization of the receptors correlates with COVID-19 presenting symptoms and organ dysfunction. Virus-induced angiotensin converting enzyme 2 downregulation may attenuate its function, diminish its anti-inflammatory role, and heighten angiotensin II effects in the predisposed patients. Lymphopenia occurs early and is prognostic, potentially associated with reduction of the CD4+ and some CD8+ T cells. This leads to imbalance of the innate/acquired immune response, delayed viral clearance, and hyperstimulated macrophages and neutrophils. Appropriate type I interferon pathway activation is critical for virus attenuation and balanced immune response. Persistent immune activation in predisposed patients, such as elderly adults and those with cardiovascular risk, can lead to hemophagocytosis-like syndrome, with uncontrolled amplification of cytokine production, leading to multiorgan failure and death. In addition to the airways and lungs, the cardiovascular system is often involved in COVID-19 early, reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides, which are all extremely prognostic, in particular, in those showing continued rise, along with cytokines such as interleukin-6. Inflammation in the vascular system can result in diffuse microangiopathy with thrombosis. Inflammation in the myocardium can result in myocarditis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, rapid deterioration, and sudden death. Aggressive support based on early prognostic indicators with expectant management can potentially improve recovery. Appropriate treatment for heart failure, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndrome, and thrombosis remain important. Specific evidence-based treatment strategies for COVID-19 will emerge with ongoing global collaboration on multiple approaches being evaluated. To protect the wider population, antibody testing and effective vaccine will be needed to make COVID-19 history. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Adoption of green fertilizer a potential resolution The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more than 4.3 million confirmed cases and more than 2,90,000 deaths worldwide. It has also given rise to fears of an imminent economic crisis and recession. Social distance, self-isolation, and travel restrictions have led to a reduction in the workforce across all economical sectors and have led to a loss of many jobs. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured goods has decreased. On the other hand, the need for medical supplies has increased significantly. The food sector is also facing increased demand as a result of panic buying and storing food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on the various aspects of the world economy. In Malaysia, the COVID-19 epidemic has checked the resilience of the agriculture sector. Especially the Malaysian paddy industry as country imports 30% of its overall consumption from different parts of the world. The real price of rice triplicating for the consumers, which was alarming for nations in this pandemic situation. The Government of Malaysia introduced the National Agrofood Policy 2011–2020 (NAP4) in 2010 as a guidance document for the implementation of agricultural sector development programs and projects in Malaysia. The NAP4 ‘s 10-year term is to be finished by the end of 2020. Several sectors demonstrate substantial success after approximately 8 years of introduction, while the other classes often lag behind the goal and progress quite slowly. Agricultural sector performance is affected by many problems and challenges. In acknowledgment of the poor success of this field, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Based Industry has launched new approaches, policies, and programs that can change the agricultural sector more rapidly. The new direction is aimed at ensuring national food security and boosting farm and revenues. The authorized government agency needs to revise the policy formulation where Malaysia needs to set stages to revolutionize and modernize the rice farming to address the problem faced by the paddy sector in this pandemic situation to adopt GF. In this study, the researcher focuses on the improvisation of the policy to increase the paddy production sustainably. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V. COVID19; GF; Malaysian paddy farmers; Sustainable agricultural practices  A Spatio-Temporal Analysis of the Environmental Correlates of COVID-19 Incidence in Spain The novel SARS-CoV2 has disrupted health systems and the economy, and public health interventions to slow its spread have been costly. How and when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether SARS-CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means of a spatio-temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per capita and presence of mass transit systems in the province; in contrast, population density and percentage of older adults display negative associations with incidence of COVID-19. © 2020 The Ohio State University   A highly specific and sensitive serological assay detects SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in COVID-19 patients that correlate with neutralization Objective: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic challenges national health systems and the global economy. Monitoring of infection rates and seroprevalence can guide public health measures to combat the pandemic. This depends on reliable tests on active and former infections. Here, we set out to develop and validate a specific and sensitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Methods: In our ELISA, we used SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a stabilized version of the spike (S) ectodomain as antigens. We assessed sera from patients infected with seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and controls. We determined and monitored IgM-, IgA- and IgG-antibody responses towards these antigens. In addition, for a panel of 22 sera, virus neutralization and ELISA parameters were measured and correlated. Results: The RBD-based ELISA detected SARS-CoV-2-directed antibodies, did not cross-react with seasonal coronavirus antibodies and correlated with virus neutralization (R2 = 0.89). Seroconversion started at 5 days after symptom onset and led to robust antibody levels at 10 days after symptom onset. We demonstrate high specificity (99.3%; N = 1000) and sensitivity (92% for IgA, 96% for IgG and 98% for IgM; &gt; 10 days after PCR-proven infection; N = 53) in serum. Conclusions: With the described RBD-based ELISA protocol, we provide a reliable test for seroepidemiological surveys. Due to high specificity and strong correlation with virus neutralization, the RBD ELISA holds great potential to become a preferred tool to assess thresholds of protective immunity after infection and vaccination. © 2020, The Author(s).

The COVID-19 outbreak has quickly spread globally and now is having remarkable effects on public health and national economies. Purpose: Effective measures for prevention and control of nosocomial infection are urgently needed to control COVID-19 infection among medical staff. Methods: Herein, we described COVID-19 prevention and control strategies that have been implemented in a tertiary hospital in the middle east of China. Hospital layout was adjusted to prevent and control transmission. Other procedures were then implemented to prevent the spread of the virus, including specialized training and evaluation of medical staff, pre-testing and triage, measures to promote early identification of patients, environmental cleaning and disinfection, new medical waste processing procedures, new patient management procedures, timely disinfection of potential sources of nosocomial infection, and strict protective measures. Results: Since the new measures were implemented, to date there have only been three new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, no cases of medical staff infection, and no COVID19-related deaths at the hospital. Conclusion: The current report provides a protocol that could be implemented in medical departments in similar cities worldwide. © 2020 Kong and Yan.

Weak medical infrastructure and over-reliance on medical aids may eventually predict worse outcomes in Africa. To reverse this trend, Africa must re-evaluate the only area with strategic advantage; phytotherapy. One of the many plants with previous antiviral potency is against RNA viruses is Aframomum melegueta. In this study, one hundred (100) A. melegueta secondary metabolites have been mined and computational evaluated for inhibition of host furin, and SARS-COV-2 targets including 3C-like proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro), 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase (nsp16) and surface glycoprotein/ACE2 receptor interface. Silica-gel column partitioning of A. melegueta fruit/seed resulted in 6 fractions tested against furin activity. Diarylheptanoid (Letestuianin A), phenylpropanoid (4-Cinnamoyl-3-hydroxy-spiro[furan-5,2′-(1′H)-indene]-1′,2,3′(2′H,5H)-trione), flavonoids (Quercetin, Apigenin and Tectochrysin) have been identified as high-binding compounds to SARS-COV-2 targets in a polypharmacology manner. Di-ethyl-ether (IC50 = 0.03 mg/L), acetone (IC50 = 1.564 mg/L), ethyl-acetate (IC50 = 0.382 mg/L) and methanol (IC50 = 0.438 mg/L) fractions demonstrated the best inhibition in kinetic assay while DEF, ASF and MEF completely inhibited furin-recognition sequence containing Ebola virus-pre-glycoprotein. In conclusion, A. melegueta and its secondary metabolites have potential for addressing the therapeutic needs of African population during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Aframomum melegueta; COVID-19; Diarylheptanoid; flavonoids; phenylpropanoid; SARS-COV-2  Zoonotic and reverse zoonotic events of SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on global health Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The viruses have adapted to infect a large number of animal species, ranging from bats to camels. At present, seven CoVs infect humans, of which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe. Healthcare systems around the globe have been stretched beyond their limits posing new challenges to emergency healthcare services and critical care. The outbreak continues to jeopardize human health, social life and economy. All known human CoVs have zoonotic origins. Recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pet, zoo and certain farm animals has highlighted its potential for reverse zoonosis. This scenario is particularly alarming, since these animals could be potential reservoirs for secondary zoonotic infections. In this article, we highlight interspecies SARS-CoV-2 infections and focus on the reverse zoonotic potential of this virus. We also emphasize the importance of potential secondary zoonotic events and the One-Health and One-World approach to tackle such future pandemics. © 2020 The Author(s).

The primary data for the study were collected through telephonic-based survey of 451 labourers during May–June 2020. The results of this study showed that, on an average, labourers in the study area remained jobless for nearly 2 months and incurred income loss of INR 28,955 thereby failed to send remittances towards their families by an amount of INR 12,215 during the reference period. As per the analysis of covariance the income loss and remittances unsent amount was higher amongst the elderly labourers engaged in professions which remained non-operational during lockdown period. Further, the additional days of joblessness increased their hardship in terms of income and remittances. With coronavirus being more than a health crisis, in short term it is necessary to minimise the loss of life, forwarding social and financial security for the families of migrant labourers and vulnerable sections for extended period of crisis, strategies for supporting agriculture and allied activities, promotion of small and medium-size enterprises, imparting skill training for the unemployed and reverse migrant labourers, financial assistance for self-employment may be helpful. Suitable coordination of monetary and fiscal policy would be helpful for reducing the unemployment heading from the recessionary trend of the economy in the long run. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd   Serological assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), March 2020 Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has major impacts on health systems, the economy and society. Assessing infection attack rates in the population is critical for estimating disease severity and herd immunity which is needed to calibrate public health interventions. We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve this in real time to impact public health decision making. Aim: Our objective was to develop and evaluate serological assays applicable in large-scale sero-epidemiological studies. Methods: We developed an ELISA to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We evaluated its sensitivity and specificity in combination with confirmatory microneutralisation (MN) and 90% plaque reduction neutralisation tests (PRNT90) in 51 sera from 24 patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 and in age-stratified sera from 200 healthy controls. Results: IgG and IgM RBD ELISA, MN and PRNT90 were reliably positive after 29 days from illness onset with no detectable cross-reactivity in age-stratified controls. We found that PRNT90 tests were more sensitive in detecting antibody than MN tests carried out with the conventional 100 tissue culture infectious dose challenge. Heparinised plasma appeared to reduce the infectivity of the virus challenge dose and may confound interpretation of neutralisation test. Conclusion: Using IgG ELISA based on the RBD of the spike protein to screen sera for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, followed by confirmation using PRNT90, is a valid approach for large-scale sero-epidemiology studies. © 2020 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Although less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, it has taken several lives and taken down the economies of many coun-tries. Before this outbreak, the most recent coronavi-rus outbreaks were the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV outbreaks that happened in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively. Since, the SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family as of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, they share several similarities. So, this review aims at un-derstanding the new scenario of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and compares the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and the genetics of these coronaviruses. Studies re-veal that SARS-CoV-2 is very similar in structure and pathogenicity with SARS-CoV, but the most important structural protein, i.e., the spike protein (S), is slightly different in these viruses. The presence of a furin-like cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 facilitates the S protein priming and might increase the efficiency of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as compared to other beta coronaviruses. So, furin inhibitors can be targeted as potential drug therapies for SARS-CoV-2. © 2020, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche. All rights reserved.

"6","15","Urban flooding events pose risks of virus spread during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic Since the first report in December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread to most parts of the world, with over 21.5 million people infected and nearly 768,000 deaths to date. Evidence suggests that transmission of the virus is primarily through respiratory droplets and contact routes, and airborne carriers such as atmospheric particulates and aerosols have also been proposed as important vectors for the environmental transmission of COVID-19. Sewage and human excreta have long been recognized as potential routes for transmitting human pathogens. The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been detected in human feces and urine, where it could remain viable for days and show infectivity. Urban flooding, a common threat in summer caused by heavy rainfalls, is frequently reported in urban communities along with sewage overflows. With summer already underway and economy re-opening in many parts of the world, urban flooding and the often-accompanied sewage overflows could jeopardize previous mitigation efforts by posing renewed risks of virus spread in affected areas and communities. In this article, we present the up-to-date evidence and discussions on sewage-associated transmission of COVID-19, and highlighted the roles of sewage overflow and sewage-contaminated aerosols in two publicized events of community outbreaks. Further, we collected evidence in real-life environments to demonstrate the shortcuts of exposure to overflowed sewage and non-dispersed human excreta during a local urban flooding event. Given that communities serviced by combined sewer systems are particularly prone to such risks, local municipalities could prioritize wastewater infrastructure upgrades and consider combined sewer separations to minimize the risks of pathogen transmission via sewage overflows during epidemics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fashion rental businesses need to strategically respond to consumers with heightened contamination concerns. This research aims to understand how diverse consumption values of fashion rental service form attitudes towards the service depending on one's contamination concerns and predict adoption intentions. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data (N = 270). The findings suggest that functional, economic, and emotional values significantly increase attitudes leading to adoption intentions. Further, contamination concerns moderate the relationships between values and attitudes as well as attitudes and intentions. The findings enrich the literature of collaborative consumption by integrating theories of consumption value and consumer contamination. Furthermore, the results provide managerial implications for strategic communication of FRS to effectively reach consumers depending on their contamination concern. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The Chinese term for this health services value is jing hua xin ling, psychological destressing. Here we present the first case where optimal tourist infrastructure is influenced by including mental health. Using a multi-stage, cross-lingual, differential stakeholder method, we analyse conflicts between road- and roadless-access tourism in the very large new Sanjiangyuan National Park, Qinghai, which offers jing hua xin ling to domestic tourists from eastern-seaboard cities. This provides a powerful tourism attraction, and hence economic opportunity, for the region around the park. If these mental health aspects are included, together with their direct and indirect consequences for tourism, then roadlessness is preferable to new roads. Similar infrastructure conflicts occur for park tourism worldwide, and jing hua xin ling can provide a global theoretical framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Adventure; COVID-19; Culture; Health; Protected area expenditure; global economy; health services; infrastructure; mental health; national park; tourism economics; tourist attraction; China; Qinghai; Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve SARS-CoV-2 in environmental perspective: Occurrence, persistence, surveillance, inactivation and challenges The unprecedented global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is depicting the distressing pandemic consequence on human health, economy as well as ecosystem services. So far novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreaks were associated with SARS-CoV-2 (2019), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) events. CoV relates to the enveloped family of Betacoronavirus (βCoV) with positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA). Knowing well the persistence, transmission, and spread of SARS-CoV-2 through proximity, the faecal-oral route is now emerging as a major environmental concern to community transmission. The replication and persistence of CoV in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through stools is indicating a potential transmission route to the environment settings. Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed. The need for wastewater epidemiology (WBE) studies for surveillance as well as for early warning signal was elaborated. This communication will provide a basis to understand the SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses in the context of the environmental engineering perspective to design effective strategies to counter the enteric virus transmission and also serves as a working paper for researchers, policy makers and regulators. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus. These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Although global efforts are in place to combat the virus, it continues to spread on a massive scale. This is not just a medical crisis; rather, it is a business crisis as well. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to develop a research scale that could be used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on business. We adopted a scale variables approach that is generated from topics covered in the papers of leading academic business journals to form the basis of our analysis. We exposed the scale to qualitative and quantitative testing and concluded that it is reliable for research on the negative effects of COVID-19 on enterprises. The scale was used to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 on businesses in two countries, namely Serbia and Kuwait, to represent two different continents. The results of this research indicate that the influence of this coronavirus is equally devastating in both countries, Kuwait with its otherwise good economic conditions and Serbia with relatively poor ones. The findings of the research are beneficial for both academics in producing quality output papers, as well as their support to managers in various business industries in their fight against coronavirus to keep their businesses sustainable. © 2021 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada Business; COVID-19; Economy; Interruptions; Kuwait; Serbia  Recessions and total factor productivity: Evidence from sectoral data The recent COVID-19 crisis has generated a concern that productivity (which was already at historically low levels) may further decline. From a theoretical standpoint, the recessions-total factor productivity (TFP) nexus is ambiguous à priori. This paper empirically examines the dynamic impact of recessions on TFP. We compute a new measure of utilization-adjusted productivity from a sample of 24 industries in 18 advanced economies between 1970 and 2014. Resorting to the local projection method we trace out the dynamic short to medium-term impact of such recessionary shocks. We find that deep recessions lead to a permanent deterioration in the level of total factor productivity. This effect is driven by the increase in resource misallocation across different sectors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The pandemic affects both individuals and the broader society across many domains, including physical and psychological health, the economy and general welfare. The measures taken to counteract the pandemic have significantly altered daily life and, along with the threat of contracting the coronavirus and uncertainties surrounding future developments, created a complex system of stressors with a negative impact on public mental health. This paper aims to outline the ESTSS strategy to address mental health issues related to COVID-19 and focuses on (1) trauma-informed policies, (2) capacity building, (3) collaborative research and (4) knowledge-exchange. To facilitate implementation of a trauma-informed approach and appropriate measures, ESTSS has developed a toolkit of recommendations on mental health and psychosocial assistance to be provided during the different phases of crisis and its aftermath. To promote capacity building, ESTSS offers a certification programme based on a curriculum in psychotraumatology and corresponding on-line training to the European community of mental health professionals. To assure evidence-based approaches and methods tailored to current circumstances, ESTSS has initiated a pan-European research project with international cooperation aimed at studying the mental health consequences of the pandemic, with a focus on psychological trauma and other stress-related reactions. To foster knowledge-exchange, the European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), the official journal of ESTSS, is publishing a special issue on COVID-19. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Using daily data over the period January 20 to May 20 and ten UK industrial sector groupings, the findings suggest a strong and statistically significant relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the performance of the conventional stock market index. The findings also suggest that the disease interacts negatively but insignificantly with the Dow Jones faith-based ethical (Islamic) index compared to its UK counterpart. In addition, through an analysis of sector groupings, the paper shows that the stock returns of the information technology sector performed significantly better than the market, while stock returns of consumer discretionary sector, which includes transportation, beverages, tourism and leisure, consumer services performed significantly worse than the market during the COVID-19 outbreak. Other sector groupings fail to yield significantly plausible parameter values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

There is an immediate need for identification of effective drugs to contain the disastrous virus outbreak. Global efforts are already underway at a war footing to identify the best drug combination to address the disease. In this review, an attempt has been made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, and based on this information potential druggable targets against SARS-CoV-2 are summarized. Also, the strategies for ongoing and future drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2 virus are outlined. Given the urgency to find a definitive cure, ongoing drug repurposing efforts being carried out by various organizations are also described. The unprecedented crisis requires extraordinary efforts from the scientific community to effectively address the issue and prevent further loss of human lives and health. © 2020, Indian Academy of Sciences.

Thereafter, all the major oil markets have become extremely volatile, and investments in these markets could lead to substantial losses. This paper empirically investigates the time-varying correlations between gold and oil markets to examine whether gold is a safe haven asset for the international crude oil markets during the COVID-19 period. For the purpose of comparison, the safe haven property of Bitcoin is tested as well. The results of the time-varying correlations obtained through the DCC-GARCH model suggest that gold is a safe haven asset for global crude oil markets. Bitcoin, on the other hand, acts only as a diversifier for crude oil. The results further show that the portfolio risk is minimized when investors include oil and gold in their portfolio rather than holding assets in oil and Bitcoin markets. Given that financial downturn, terrorist attacks, pandemics and similar global events often play a crucial role in portfolio risk analysis, our results could be of interest to those who invest in oil, gold and Bitcoin markets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Bitcoin; COVID-19; Crude oil; Gold; Safe haven Bitcoin; Crude oil; Gold; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Coronaviruses; Crude oil market; DCC-GARCH models; International crude oil markets; Oil market; Portfolio risks; Terrorist attacks; Time varying; Investments; correlation; COVID-19; crude oil; disease incidence; economic impact; oil trade; resource economy; respiratory disease; risk assessment; viral disease; Coronavirus Retweets of officials’ alarming vs reassuring messages during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for crisis management Coronavirus related discussions have spiraled at an exponential rate since its initial outbreak. By the end of May, more than 6 million people were diagnosed with this infection. Twitter witnessed an outpouring of anxious tweets through messages associated with the spread of the virus. Government and health officials replied to the troubling tweets, reassuring the public with regular alerts on the virus's progress and information to defend against the virus. We observe that social media users are worried about Covid 19-related crisis and we identify three separate conversations on virus contagion, prevention, and the economy. We analyze the tone of officials’ tweet text as alarming and reassuring and capture the response of Twitter users to official communications. Such studies can provide insights to health officials and government agencies for crisis management, specifically regarding communicating emergency information to the public via social media for establishing reassurance. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Alarming; Analytics; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Crisis management; Government; Reassurance; Social media; Twitter Viruses; Coronaviruses; Crisis management; Emergency information; Exponential rates; Government agencies; Social media; Social networking (online) Potential application of mesenchymal stem cells and their exosomes in lung injury: an emerging therapeutic option for COVID-19 patients The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global public health and the international economy; therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective therapy to treat COVID-19 patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as an emerging therapeutic option for the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, numerous clinical trials have been registered to examine the safety and efficacy of different types of MSCs and their exosomes for treating COVID-19 patients, with less published data on the mechanism of action. Although there is no approved effective therapy for COVID-19 as of yet, MSC therapies showed an improvement in the treatment of some COVID-19 patients. MSC’s therapeutic effect is displayed in their ability to reduce the cytokine storm, enhance alveolar fluid clearance, and promote epithelial and endothelial recovery; however, the safest and most effective route of MSC delivery remains unclear. The use of poorly characterized MSC products remains one of the most significant drawbacks of MSC-based therapy, which could theoretically promote the risk for thromboembolism. Optimizing the clinical-grade production of MSCs and establishing a consensus on registered clinical trials based on cell-product characterization and mode of delivery would aid in laying the foundation for a safe and effective therapy in COVID-19. In this review, we shed light on the mechanistic view of MSC therapeutic role based on preclinical and clinical studies on acute lung injury and ARDS; therefore, offering a unique correlation and applicability in COVID-19 patients. We further highlight the challenges and opportunities in the use of MSC-based therapy. © 2020, The Author(s).

COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, is highly contagious and has led to an ongoing pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 affects, mainly, the respiratory system, with most severe cases primarily showcasing acute respiratory distress syndrome. Currently, no targeted therapy exists, and since the number of infections and death toll keeps rising, it has become a necessity to study possible therapeutic targets. Antiviral drugs can target various stages of the viral infection, and in the case of SARS-CoV-2, both structural and non-structural proteins have been proposed as potential drug targets.

One way to characterize supply chains is through multiregional input-output linkages. Using a multiregional input-output dataset, we build the multilayer network of supply chains in the United States. Together with a network cascade model, the multilayer network is used to explore the propagation of economic shocks along intranational supply chains. We find that the effect of economic shocks, measured using the avalanche size or total number of collapsed nodes, varies widely depending on the geographic location and economic sector of origin of a shock. The response of the supply chains to shocks reveals a threshold-like behavior. Below a certain failure or fragility level, the avalanche size increases relatively quickly for any node in the network. Based on this result, we find that the most fragile regions tend to be located in the central United States, which are regions that tend to specialize in food production and manufacturing. The most fragile layers are chemical and pharmaceutical products, services and food-related products, which are all sectors that have been disrupted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. The fragility risk, measured by the intersection of the fragility level of a node and its exposure to shocks, varies across regions and sectors. This suggests that interventions aiming to make the supply-chain network more robust to shocks are likely needed at multiple levels of network aggregation. © 2020, The Author(s).

Evidence from SARS The work presented in this paper uses empirical evidence to highlight the important role digital technology plays in mitigating a pandemic's economic disruption. As extensive datasets including the effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic are still unavailable, this study provides an assessment of the role of digitization at the time of SARS in 2003. Results are robust in pointing out that those countries with better broadband connectivity were able to mitigate some of the economic losses incurred by the pandemic. While anecdotal evidence is plentiful even for COVID-19, this study provides rigorous analysis to support that a reliable telecommunications infrastructure and a high level of digitization is crucial to keep the economy running under pandemic conditions. These results provide valuable evidence for the current context of COVID-19, which has resulted in several national lockdowns around the world. In consequence, we believe that the public and private sectors must collaborate and work together to promote the enhancement of the digital ecosystem. In the long run, a suitable regulatory framework seems crucial to stimulate private investments to close the digital supply gap, as well as promoting the digitization of business process and the training of the workforce to acquire digital skills. In the short term, we discuss several measures that can be taken to accommodate the expected increases in internet traffic in such circumstances and maintain the quality of service. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Digital ecosystem; Pandemics; Telecommunications Investments; Losses; Anecdotal evidences; Broadband connectivity; Digital technologies; Private investment; Public and private sector; Regulatory frameworks; Rigorous analysis; Telecommunications infrastructures; Quality of service Impact of COVID-19 Measures on Short-Term Electricity Consumption in the Most Affected EU Countries and USA States Energy Policy; Energy Engineering; Energy Resources; Energy Management © 2020 The Author(s)As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, governments have been implementing a wide range of measures to contain it, from movement restrictions to economy-wide shutdowns. Understanding their impacts is essential to support better policies for countries still experiencing outbreaks or in case of emergence of subsequent pandemic waves. Here we show that the cumulative decline in electricity consumption within the 5 months following the stay-home orders ranges between 3% and 12% in the most affected EU countries and USA states, except Florida, which shows no significant impact. Italy, France, Spain, California, Austria, and New York have recovered baseline consumption by the end of July, whereas Great Britain and Germany remain below baseline levels. We also show that the relationship between measures stringency and daily decline in electricity consumption is nonlinear. These results illustrate the severity of the crisis across countries and can support further research on the effect of specific measures. © 2020 The Author(s) Energy Engineering; Energy Management; Energy Policy; Energy Resources  COVID-19 Vaccine: A comprehensive status report The current COVID-19 pandemic has urged the scientific community internationally to find answers in terms of therapeutics and vaccines to control SARS-CoV-2. Published investigations mostly on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS has taught lessons on vaccination strategies to this novel coronavirus. This is attributed to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV on the host cell i.e. human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) and is approximately 79% similar genetically to SARS-CoV. Though the efforts on COVID-19 vaccines started very early, initially in China, as soon as the outbreak of novel coronavirus erupted and then world-over as the disease was declared a pandemic by WHO. But we will not be having an effective COVID-19 vaccine before September, 2020 as per very optimistic estimates. This is because a successful COVID-19 vaccine will require a cautious validation of efficacy and adverse reactivity as the target vaccinee population include high-risk individuals over the age of 60, particularly those with chronic co-morbid conditions, frontline healthcare workers and those involved in essentials industries. Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances. The COVID-19 pandemic which probably is the most devastating one in the last 100 years after Spanish flu mandates the speedy evaluation of the multiple approaches for competence to elicit protective immunity and safety to curtail unwanted immune-potentiation which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this virus. This review is aimed at providing an overview of the efforts dedicated to an effective vaccine for this novel coronavirus which has crippled the world in terms of economy, human health and life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This article explores whether it is possible to alter existing data governance extractivist models to incentivize the emergence of platform and data co-operatives to protect European pandemic citizens’ labor and digital rights. As such, this article aims to decipher the rationale behind the proliferation of platform and data co-operatives by responding to how new forms of co-operatives using digital technologies can provide feasible socio-economic alternatives to improve post-COVID-19 working conditions for vulnerable or already empowered pandemic citizens. This article is structured as follows. First, the European “pandemic citizenship” term is described. Second, the rationale of this article is consequently presented. Third, the research question, two hypotheses, and the action research triangulation are described. The deployment of the triangulation methodology based on action research, mixed methods and social innovation reveals the main findings through (i) Delphi study results, (ii) a taxonomy for platform and data co-operative cases, and ultimately, (iii) fieldwork research conducted in Glasgow, Barcelona and Tallinn. This article concludes that co-operatives (platform-based or data-driven), stemming from the potential resilient response of European pandemic citizens, may currently portray a feasible alternative to data governance extractivist models. © 2020 by the author.

It had spread to almost all countries globally by March 2020. The pandemic severely affected health and economy globally, prompting countries to take drastic measures to combat the virus. This study aims to analyze different governments' responses to the pandemic to gain insights on how best to fight the Coronavirus. Methodology: Various data analysis operations like clustering and bivariate analysis were carried out using Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib to clean up, consolidate, and visualize data. Insights were drawn from the analysis conducted. Results: We identified that the mortality rate/case fatality rate is directly proportional to the percentage of elderly (people above 65 years of age) for the top thirty countries by cases. Countries in Western Europe showed the highest mortality rates, whereas countries in South Asia and the Middle East showed the lowest mortality rate (controlling for all other variables). Conclusion: Lockdowns are effective in curbing the spread of the virus. A higher amount of testing resulted in a lesser spreading of the virus and better control. In most regions, countries that were conducting a large number of tests also seemed to have lower mortality rates. © 2020 Craniofacial Research Foundation Case fatality rate; COVID-19; Lockdowns; Mortality rate  Economic paradigms and corporate culture after the great COVID-19 pandemic: Towards a new role of welfare organisations and insurers Current events have put us in front of new paradigms on which our life and its economic aspects seem to be based: the worldwide spread of contagion from COVID-19 threatens dramatic long-term changes in the economy, lifestyle, and social structures. Valuing virtuous behaviour through the transfer and sharing of risks among several actors allows us to achieve benefits for all. The COVID-19 pandemic leads us to experiment with new forms of public health protection, including through insurance instruments. The role of insurance companies, intrinsically linked with the protection of primary areas such as healthcare and welfare, therefore becomes more critical than ever in terms of securing the protection of people, families, and productive activities. This work endorses the design of a virtuous cycle of investments, which may be implemented starting with insurance companies; such a project would unfold through insurance policies' contractual lines, securitisation schemes, investment policies, and socially responsible corporate strategies. © 2020 by the authors.

When the endogenized slack state is estimated as the period of the unemployment rate higher than about 12%, the estimated cumulative multipliers are significantly larger during slack periods than nonslack periods and are above unity. We also examine the possibility of time-varying regimes of slackness and find that our empirical results are robust under a more flexible framework. Our estimation results point out the importance of the heterogenous effects of fiscal policy and shed light on the prospect of fiscal policy in response to economic shocks from the current COVID-19 pandemic.

A preliminary study on exploring the critical success factors for developing COVID-19 preventive strategy with an economy centric approach Purpose: In the wake of COVID-19, most of the countries at present, are in a dilemma whether to extend lockdown at the cost of economy or to improve the hard-hit economy by lifting the lockdown. It is indicated by the reputed organizations and medical fraternity that corona will stay here for a longer period contrary to the earlier assumptions. Hence the purpose of this study is to suggest a strategy which balances both preventive measures and economic losses to control the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: There is a need for the identification of the critical success factors (CSFs) for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies to control the pandemic with an economy-centric approach. Findings: The six CSFs identified are “Effective communication”, “Social distancing”, “Adopting new technology”, “Modify the rules and regulation at workplace”, “Sealing the borders of the territory” and “Strong leadership and government control”. Research limitations/implications: The study has a vital contribution to literature as no previous study has identified CSFs for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies while focusing on the economy. Practical implications: Further, these identified CSFs are helpful in medium and longer-term planning which is required to rebalance and re-energize the economy following this epidemic crisis. Originality/value: The study has given a model that depicts the cause and influence relationship between the key factors in the system under question. The importance of study increases many fold, as resources are limited and the outcome of the study could be used to channelize the resources effectively. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

In the process of fighting against the epidemic in China, the clinical value of a variety of herbal medicines has been recognized and written into the clinical application guide. However, their effective molecular mechanism and potential targets are still not clear. Pathology and pharmacology research will gradually attract attention in the post-epidemic outbreak term. Here, we constructed a COVID-19 protein microarray of potential therapy targets, which contains the main drug targets to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the anti-virus, anti-inflammatory cellar targets of the host. Series of quality controls test has been carried out, which showed that it could be applied for drug target screening of bio-active natural products. The establishment of this microarray will provide a useful tool for the study of the molecular pharmacology of natural products. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines against future pathogens. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Sartorius, D’Apice, Manco and De Berardinis. antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19; emerging infectious diseases; epidemics; pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; vaccines; viruses bacterial vaccine; CD47 antigen; DNA vaccine; hemagglutinin; hepatitis B surface antigen; live vaccine; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; subunit vaccine; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; inactivated vaccine; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody response; avian influenza (H5N1); cross reaction; cytokine production; dendritic cell; dengue; Dengue virus; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; gene expression; health care personnel; hepatitis E; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; innate immunity; Lassa fever; liver injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Review; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; SARS coronavirus; vaccination; virus infection; virus neutralization; virus particle; West Nile fever; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vaccines, DNA; Vaccines, Inactivated; Vaccines, Subunit; Viral Vaccines Coronavirus RNA Proofreading: Molecular Basis and Therapeutic Targeting The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is wreaking havoc on worldwide public health and economies has heightened awareness about the lack of effective antiviral treatments for human coronaviruses (CoVs). Many current antivirals, notably nucleoside analogs (NAs), exert their effect by incorporation into viral genomes and subsequent disruption of viral replication and fidelity. The development of anti-CoV drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to proofread and remove mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and transcription. Here, we review the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading complex and evaluate its potential as a drug target. We also consider existing nucleoside analogs and novel genomic techniques as potential anti-CoV therapeutics that could be used individually or in combination to target the proofreading mechanism. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Robson et al. examine the molecular basis of the coronavirus proofreading mechanism and how this contributes to the resistance of this family of viruses to nucleoside analog (NA) antiviral drugs.

It has had a devastating effect around the world, not only for public health, but also for the economy, labor market, and other facets of individual and societal life. Health systems have been put under high strain, and health professionals have experienced unusual and stressful work circumstances. With the aim of drawing lessons for nursing education, the present study analyzed, during the weeks of peak infection in Spain, the stress experience and coping strategies of a sample of 403 nurses from the Spanish health system. Specifically, we analyzed how tenure, stress appraisal, problem-focused coping, and support-seeking coping predicted nurses’ awareness of their education needs, both in terms of technical-professional knowledge and skills and transversal skills. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that more tenure (years of experience) was related to lower stress appraisal (workload, −0.12, p < 0.05; insufficient preparation, −0.33, p < 0.001; and fear of contagion −0.36, p < 0.001) and more problem focused coping (PFC) strategies were related to higher awareness of professional (0.18, p < 0.01) and transversal educational needs (0.17, p < 0.01) while support seeking strategies just related to transversal training needs (0.10, p < 0.05). Moreover, the participants provided valuable input about specific contents to be considered in future nursing education programs. Implications for redesigning the nursing degree curriculum are analyzed in the discussion section. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Functions of the dependence on the number of the infected populations in Eastern Europe on pandemic duration were calculated based on trend analysis. Factors affecting the intensity of disease and the number of infected persons have been determined. Integral model of their influence has been built using regression analysis. Based on the values of the factors, the number of infected people and the rate of infection were predicted for each of the Eastern European countries. The prognostic duration of the stage of exponential disease growth and the total duration of quarantine (epidemiological saturation point) are substantiated. The predicted decline in Eastern European GDP due to COVID-19 has been estimated based on the construction of a prognostic regression model. The results obtained can be used by state authorities and economic agents as a tool for active and preventive response. They can also serve as an example of the urgent need to develop, especially in non-standard situations, mechanisms and products of open innovation. © 2020 by the authors.

This disease started to change economic, social, and individual conventional behaviors. Several economic activities have sharply declined, and demand for commodities is decreasing, such as oil. This commodity has also suffered from disagreement among Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)+ members to deal with the amount of cutting oil production. This situation adds a supply-side problem into declining demand due to Covid-19. Turkey, as an emerging economy, highly depends on imported oil and suffers from this pandemic disease. This study aims to analyze the compensating role of falling oil prices for impacts of Covid-19 on non-recoverable sectors in Turkey, e.g. tourism, travel, and transportation. The main argument in the study, that is falling prices in oil can contribute to compensation for losing revenue from tourism, travel, and transport. Throughout the study, ORANI-G as a multisectoral computable general equilibrium model is employed. Three scenarios, namely Scenario-1, 2A, and 2B, are set to analyze the effects of falling oil prices as compensation for Covid-19 in the selected sectors. Results show that Covid-19 decreases gross domestic product by 1.16 but falling oil prices as 25 and 50% compensate for this decrease by 0.72 and 1.56% gross domestic product increases, respectively. It is concluded that through the falling oil prices, Turkey’s dependence on crude oil imports might provide a new reparation to overcome non-recoverable impacts. This study is scoped with selected sectors and falling oil prices. Other economic and social sectors need to be investigated in terms of challenges of Covid-19 and opportunities for declining crude oil prices. Besides, competitiveness based on the scale of firms and the ability to access business finance should be analyzed within the changing business model in the post-coronavirus period. © The Author(s) 2020. computable general equilibrium; Covid-19; non-recoverable sectors; oil prices; Turkish economy Competition; Costs; Cutting fluids; Petroleum analysis; Petroleum industry; Petroleum transportation; Tourism; Amount of cuttings; Business modeling; Computable general equilibrium; Computable general equilibrium model; Economic activities; Emerging economies; Gross domestic products; Organization of Petroleum Ex-porting Countries; Crude oil price Emerging mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic: An Indian perspective The current global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, has posed an unprecedented challenge to our health systems, economy, socio-political organizations, and the infrastructure of most countries and the world. This pandemic has affected physical health as well as mental health adversely. Several recent evidence suggests that health systems across the world have to improve their preparedness in context to infectious pandemics. The research on mental health aspects of COVID-19 and other related pandemics is lacking due to obvious reasons. This narrative review article, along with our personal views, is on various current and future mental health issues in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic focusing on various challenges and suggested solutions. The aim is also to update mental health strategies in the context of such rapidly spreading contagious illness, which can act as a resource for such a situation, currently and in future. We recommend that there is a need to facilitate mental health research to understand the psychiatric aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, include psychiatrists in the task force, and make available psychotropic and other medications with special attention to the deprived sector of the society. © 2020 Indian Journal of Psychiatry Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

While, healthcare systems are globally operating at maximum capacity, healthcare workers and especially anesthesia providers are facing extreme pressures, something that is also leading to declining availability and increasing stress. In this regard, it is extremely concerning the fact that some regions worldwide have reported up to 20% of their cases to be healthcare workers. When considering that the global case fatality rate may be as much as 5.4%, these numbers are concerning and unacceptable. As this pandemic accelerates, access to personal protective equipment for health workers is a key concern since at present, healthcare workers are every country's most valuable resource in the fight against COVID-19. Governments and heath organizations should take care of their staff and support them in any way possible. This review aims to describe the current situation anesthesia providers are facing in the setting of COVID-19 and provide solutions and evidence on important concerns, including which guidance to follow, the level of equipment that is adequate, and the level of protection they need for every patient being administered an anesthetic. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd anesthesiologist; COVID-19; critical care; nurse anesthetist; personal protective equipment anesthesia; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; health care; health care personnel; human; information dissemination; medical staff; mortality; priority journal; recovery room; Review; surgery; systematic review; virus load; virus transmission; anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; health care personnel; pandemic; procedures; protective equipment; virus pneumonia; Anesthesiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral Investigating the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India under lockdown In this paper, we investigate the ongoing dynamics of COVID-19 in India after its emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019. We discuss the effect of nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020. We also predict a 7 to 21% increase in the peak value of active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd  Public health; Control strategies; Global threats; Peak values; Susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered; Wuhan , China; Health risks A fragile and divided European Union meets Covid-19: further disintegration or ‘Hamiltonian moment’? Despite being symmetric in its very nature, the Covid-19 shock is affecting European economies in a very asymmetric way, threatening to deepen the divide between core and peripheral countries even more. It is not Covid-19 itself, however, but the contradictions within the EU’s growth model and institutional architecture that would be to blame for such an outcome. The dramatic impact of the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic and the threat that it poses to Eurozone survival seem to have forced a reluctant Germany into action: a minor step, but an important signal. This note analyses the crossroads currently facing Europe—the risk of disintegration vis-a-vis the opportunity for a ‘Hamiltonian moment’—discussing possible future scenarios in the light of past developments. © 2020, The Author(s).

Public bads, leadership failures and monetary hegemony COVID-19 is the most invasive global crisis in the postwar era, jeopardizing all dimensions of human activity. By theorizing COVID-19 as a public bad, I shed light on one of the great debates of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries regarding the relationship between the United States and liberal international order (LIO). Conceptualizing the pandemic as a public bad, I analyze its consequences for US hegemony. Unlike other international public bads and many of the most important public goods that make up the LIO, the COVID-19 public bad not only has some degree of rivalry but can be made partially excludable, transforming it into more of a club good. Domestically, I demonstrate how the failure to effectively manage the COVID-19 public bad has compromised America's ability to secure the health of its citizens and the domestic economy, the very foundations for its international leadership. These failures jeopardize US provision of other global public goods. Internationally, I show how the US has already used the crisis strategically to reinforce its opposition to free international movement while abandoning the primary international institution tasked with fighting the public bad, the World Health Organization (WHO). While the only area where the United States has exercised leadership is in the monetary sphere, I argue this feat is more consequential for maintaining hegemony. However, even monetary hegemony could be at risk if the pandemic continues to be mismanaged. © The Author(s) 2020.   Health policy and leadership models during the COVID-19 pandemic: A review On March 11, 2020, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Approximately 19.3 million people have now been infected and over 700,000 have died. This global public health crisis has since cascaded into a series of challenges for leaders around the world, threatening both the health and economy of populations. This paper attempts to compartmentalise leadership aspects, allowing a closer examination of published reports and the analysis of current outcomes, thus enabling the authors to formulate a number of evidence-based recommendations on the de-escalation of restrictions. © 2020 COVID-19; Healthcare policy; Leadership; Management; Novel coronavirus coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; emergency care; evidence based practice; health care policy; hospital admission; human; interpersonal communication; leadership; medical specialist; morbidity; mortality rate; pandemic; patient monitoring; population; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; treatment planning; World Health Organization; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; public health; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Policy; Humans; Leadership; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health Supply chain contagion and the role of industrial policy The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a major disruption in global value chains (GVCs) that pushed the global economy into a recession that promises to be worse than the 2008 crisis. This article illustrates the mechanisms through which the COVID-19 pandemic affected GVCs in the context of a changing configuration of the global economy. In particular, it is argued that GVCs became the main transmission channels of “economic contagion”. Finally, we posit that the pandemic provides an opportunity to revive the role of industrial policy as to govern the landslides of a world economy constantly pressured by globalization and deglobalization forces. © 2020, The Author(s).

Till date, there is no approved medicine/treatment to cure COVID-19, whereas, vaccine development efforts are going on high priority. This review aimed to provide an overview of prior art, recent advances, vaccine designing strategies, current scenario, opportunities and challenges related to development of coronavirus vaccine. Method: A literature survey was conducted using Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar with the search key as: coronavirus vaccine, SARS vaccine, MERS vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Articles related to above search query were retrieved, sorted, analyzed and developed into an easy-to-understand review. Results: The genome phylogenetic analysis suggested that genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is almost 80% similar to that of SARS-CoV, further both these viruses bind to same host cell receptor ACE-2. Hence it is expected that, previously available literature data about coronavirus vaccine designing may play crucial role in development of rapid vaccine against COVID-19. In view of this, the present review discuss (i) existing information (from 2003 to present) about the type of vaccine, antigen, immunogenic response, animal model, route of administration, adjuvants and current scenario for designing of coronavirus vaccine (ii) potential factors and challenges related to rapid development of COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: In conclusion, we discuss possible clues/ target sites for designing of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus based on prior-art. © 2020 Diabetes India Adjuvants; Antigens; Coronavirus disease vaccine; COVID-19 vaccine; Spike protein angiotensin converting enzyme 2; Coronavirus vaccine; DNA vaccine; immunological adjuvant; inactivated vaccine; live vaccine; nanomaterial; severe acute respiratory syndrome vaccine; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; virus antigen; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; virus vaccine; animal model; Article; commercial phenomena; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; drug repositioning; human; infection control; Middle East respiratory syndrome; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; protein subunit; SARS coronavirus; scale up; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; systematic review; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; vaccine production; virus genome; virus mutation; virus virulence; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirinae; Coronavirus infection; immunology; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Viral Vaccines Antiviral potential of nanoparticles—can nanoparticles fight against coronaviruses? Infectious diseases account for more than 20% of global mortality and viruses are responsible for about one-third of these deaths. Highly infectious viral diseases such as severe acute respiratory (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are emerging more frequently and their worldwide spread poses a serious threat to human health and the global economy. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 27 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 16 million people and led to the death of more than 652,434 individuals as on 27 July 2020 while also causing significant economic losses. To date, there are no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines to help mitigate this pandemic. Non-Conventional antiviral agents must also be considered and exploited. In this regard, nanoparticles can be used as antiviral agents for the treatment of various viral infections. The use of nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for the development of novel antiviral therapies with a low probability of developing drug resistance compared to conventional chemical-based antiviral therapies. In this review, we first discuss viral mechanisms of entry into host cells and then we detail the major and important types of nanomaterials that could be used as antiviral agents. These nanomaterials include silver, gold, quantum dots, organic nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers and polymers. Further, we consider antiviral mechanisms, the effects of nanoparticles on coronaviruses and therapeutic approaches of nanoparticles. Finally, we provide our perspective on the future of nanoparticles in the fight against viral infections. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is having serious consequences on health and the economy worldwide. All evidence-based treatment strategies need to be considered to combat this new virus. Drugs need to be considered on scientific grounds of efficacy, safety and cost. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are old drugs used in the treatment of malaria. Moreover, their antiviral properties have been previously studied, including against coronaviruses, where evidence of efficacy has been found. In the current race against time triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the search for new antivirals is very important. However, consideration should be given to old drugs with known anti-coronavirus activity, such as CQ and HCQ. These could be integrated into current treatment strategies while novel treatments are awaited, also in light of the fact that they display an anticoagulant effect that facilitates the activity of low-molecular-weight heparin, aimed at preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-associated thrombotic events. The safety of CQ and HCQ has been studied for over 50 years, however recently published data raise concerns for cardiac toxicity of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19. This review also re-examines the real information provided by some of the published alarming reports, although concluding that cardiac toxicity should in any case be stringently monitored in patients receiving CQ/HCQ. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Antiviral; Chloroquine; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2; chloroquine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; glycoprotein gp 120; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hydroxychloroquine; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; papain; papain like protease; quinone reductase 2; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone); tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; anticoagulant agent; antiinflammatory agent; antivirus agent; chloroquine; cytokine; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; hydroxychloroquine; immunologic factor; anticoagulation; antiviral activity; Article; autophagy (cellular); avian influenza (H5N1); CD4+ T lymphocyte; disease severity; drug blood level; drug distribution; drug half life; drug mechanism; enzyme inhibition; human; immunomodulation; immunopathogenesis; in vitro study; in vivo study; molecular docking; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein expression; severe acute respiratory syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection; trans Golgi network; virus neutralization; virus replication; autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; cytokine release syndrome; disseminated intravascular clotting; drug effect; genetics; growth, development and aging; host pathogen interaction; immunology; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus entry; virus pneumonia; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Anticoagulants; Antiviral Agents; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Cytokines; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Immunologic Factors; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Virus Internalization; Virus Replication The antiviral, anti-inflammatory effects of natural medicinal herbs and mushrooms and SARS-CoV-2 infection The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, producing the disease COVID-19 is a pathogenic virus that targets mostly the human respiratory system and also other organs. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, however there have been previous outbreaks of different versions of the beta coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV1) from 2002 to 2003 and the most recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. All of the above have been recognised as major pathogens that are a great threat to public health and global economies. Currently, no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified; however, certain drugs have shown apparent efficacy in viral inhibition of the disease. Natural substances such as herbs and mushrooms have previously demonstrated both great antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, the possibilities of natural substances as effective treatments against COVID-19 may seem promising. One of the potential candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be Inonotus obliquus (IO), also known as chaga mushroom. IO commonly grows in Asia, Europe and North America and is widely used as a raw material in various medical conditions. In this review, we have evaluated the most effective herbs and mushrooms, in terms of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects which have been assessed in laboratory conditions. © 2020 by the authors.

To date, there is no specific medicine or vaccine available against this pandemic disease. However, the presence of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules with antiviral properties might also be a successful strategy in order to develop therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this review will summarize the available literature and other information/data sources related to antiviral medicinal plants, with possible ethnobotanical evidence in correlation with coronaviruses. The identification of novel antiviral compounds is of critical significance, and medicinal plant based natural compounds are a good source for such discoveries. In depth search and analysis revealed several medicinal plants with excellent efficacy against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which are well-known to act on ACE-2 receptor, 3CLpro and other viral protein targets. In this review, we have consolidated the data of several medicinal plants and their natural bioactive metabolites, which have promising antiviral activities against coronaviruses with detailed modes of action/mechanism. It is concluded that this review will be useful for researchers worldwide and highly recommended for the development of naturally safe and effective therapeutic drugs/agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be used in therapeutic protocols alone or in combination with chemically synthetized drugs. © 2020, MDPI AG.

From this perspective, plasmonic-based biosensing can manage the threat of infectious diseases by providing timely virus monitoring. In recent years, many plasmonics’ platforms have embraced the challenge of offering on-site strategies to complement traditional diagnostic methods relying on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This review compiled recent progress on the development of novel plasmonic sensing schemes for the effective control of virus-related diseases. A special focus was set on the utilization of plasmonic nanostructures in combination with other detection formats involving colorimetric, fluorescence, luminescence, or Raman scattering enhancement. The quantification of different viruses (e.g., hepatitis virus, influenza virus, norovirus, dengue virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus) with particular attention to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reviewed from the perspective of the biomarker and the biological receptor immobilized on the sensor chip. Technological limitations including selectivity, stability, and monitoring in biological matrices were also reviewed for different plasmonic-sensing approaches. © 2020 by the author.

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus, is even more devastating in terms of patient mortality. At the time of this writing, the nanoscopic SARS-Cov-2 virus has paralyzed the world economy and resulted in what are likely permanent changes in our expectations of society and daily life. New technology is needed to reduce the economic and social impacts of diseases such as COVID-19 and prevent additional negative consequences resulting from subsequent pandemics. As viruses such as Influenza A and SARS-Cov-2 are transmitted from person to person by exposure to infected secretions, inexpensive at-home or workplace tests for the analysis of the virus content within those secretions, such as saliva or mucus from the nasopharynx (as in a swab-based test) or oropharynx (as in a saliva-based test), will be critical for a safe return to work, school, and cultural activities. The most reliable approaches for viral sensing are polymerase chain reaction and protein detection via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; however, these approaches require extensive sample handling, laboratory infrastructure, and long sample-to-result time. Advances are leading to increased point-of-care capability for these testing methods, but even this effort is insufficient for curbing the impact of the current pandemic. There are many options for alternative virus (or antigen) detection currently in development. These novel approaches are more amenable for testing in home or workplace without specialized equipment and training and include measurements of mass changes, heat of adsorption, electrochemical changes, changes in optical properties, and changes in electronic properties. Of these transduction mechanisms, electronic property measurements of materials as they interact with virus-containing secretions offer the greatest potential for simplicity, selectivity, and sensitivity needed to revolutionize traditional laboratory assays for at-home pathogen detection. We have, therefore, focused this review on the operation and architecture of electronic antigen sensors, specifically those demonstrating a change in electrical conductivity when interacting with a specific antigen, with hopes that a brief summary of over five decades of research in this area will be beneficial to those developing alternative, user-friendly routes for detection of viruses at this or any time. A key element in electronic virus sensing with useful sensitivity is the use of nanomaterials with ultrahigh surface-to-volume ratios, maximizing the change in charge carrier density upon adsorption events. So-called ""low-dimensional materials""are materials characterized by nanoscopic length scales in at least one dimension. One-dimensional nanomaterials such as nanowires and nanotubes are well-established as effective sensing materials with potential for high sensitivity; however, their realization on a large scale has been challenging. Two-dimensional materials are planar materials with thicknesses of one or a few molecular layers and represent the ultimate limit of the surface-to-volume ratio with promising demonstrations of large-scale production and sensitive, selective virus sensing with many options for functionalization. All aspects of 2D sensor fabrication, functionalization, and use are addressed. © 2020 Author(s).

We employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon for their livelihoods. © 2020 The Authors Coronavirus; Global health; Modeling; Wastewater-based epidemiology Computational methods; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Population statistics; Travel time; Computational analysis; Global economics; Local conditions; Medical screening; Orders of magnitude; Population sizes; Specific location; Two-step process; Monitoring; COVID-19; epidemiology; infectious disease; respiratory disease; severe acute respiratory syndrome; temperature effect; wastewater; Article; clinical evaluation; computer simulation; coronavirus disease 2019; cost control; disease surveillance; feasibility study; geographic distribution; global health; human; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; pandemic; population size; priority journal; resource management; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; waste water; wastewater based epidemiology; water temperature; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; Louisiana; New York; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Detroit; Hubei; Iran; Italy; Lombardy; Louisiana; Madrid [Spain]; Michigan; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; New Orleans; New York [United States]; Seattle; Spain; Tehran [Iran]; United States; Washington [United States]; Wuhan; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Feasibility Studies; Humans; New Orleans; New York City; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Wastewater-Based Epidemiological Monitoring Does the Indian Financial Market Nosedive because of the COVID-19 Outbreak, in Comparison to after Demonetisation and the GST? We investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian financial market and compare it with the outcomes of two recent structural changes of the Indian economy: demonetization and implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Using daily stock return, net foreign institutional investment, and exchange rate data from January 3, 2003 to April 20, 2020, we find negative stock returns for all the indices during the COVID-19 outbreak, unlike during the post-demonetization and GST phases. Markov switching vector autoregression shows the impact of COVID-19 on stock returns is severe in comparison to that of demonetization and the GST. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Each country has a different response method, and the damage scale is also distinct. This study aims to find out how COVID-19-related news was handled in the domestic media to seek ways to minimize the pandemic. The paper focuses on the number of news features by period and by disaster and analyzes related words based on big data. The results of the analysis are as follows. First, in the initial response phase, keywords to identify accurate sources of actual broadcast contents, fake news, social networking service (SNS), etc. were also ranked in the top 20. Second, in the active response phase, when the number of confirmed persons and the government’s countermeasures were announced, more than 100 COVID-19-related articles were issued, and the related words increased rapidly from the initial response stage. Therefore, the fact that COVID-19 has been expressed as a keyword indicates that our society is watching with great interest in the government’s response to the disease. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: 230 National Health System hospitals were studied over the two-year period 2010–2012 according to their ownership structure— public hospitals, private hospitals and public–private partnership (PPP)—data envelopment analysis orientated to inputs was used to measure the overall technical efficiency, pure efficiency and efficiency of scale. A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with binomial distribution and logit link function was used to analyse the hospital and regional variables associated with positioning on the frontier. Results: There are substantial differences between the average pure technical efficiency of public, private and PPP hospitals, as well as a greater number of PPP models being positioned on the efficiency frontier (91.67% in 2012). The odds of being positioned on the frontier are 41.7 times higher in PPP models than in public hospitals. The average annual household income per region is related to the greater odds of hospitals being positioned on the frontier of efficiency. Conclusions: During the most acute period of recession in the Spanish economy, PPP formulas favoured hospital efficiency, by increasing the odds of being positioned on the frontier of efficiency when compared to private and public hospitals. The position on the frontier of efficiency of a hospital is related to the wealth of its region. © MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

While distancing measures can safeguard public health, they also can profoundly impact the economy and may have important indirect effects on the environment. The extent to which physical distancing measures should be applied therefore depends on the trade-offs between their health benefits and their economic costs. We develop an epidemiological-economic model to examine the optimal duration and intensity of physical distancing measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. In an application to the United States, our model considers the trade-off between the lives saved by physical distancing—both directly from stemming the spread of the virus and indirectly from reductions in air pollution during the period of physical distancing—and the short- and long-run economic costs that ensue from such measures. We examine the effect of air pollution co-benefits on the optimal physical distancing policy and conduct sensitivity analyses to gauge the influence of several key parameters and uncertain model assumptions. Using recent estimates of the association between airborne particulate matter and the virulence of COVID-19, we find that accounting for air pollution co-benefits can significantly increase the intensity and duration of the optimal physical distancing policy. To conclude, we broaden our discussion to consider the possibility of durable changes in peoples’ behavior that could alter local markets, the global economy, and our relationship to nature for years to come. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

This disease has hugely affected healthcare systems as well as the economy to an extent never seen before. To date, COVID-19 infection has led to about 165000 deaths in 150 countries. At present, there is no specific drug or efficient treatment for this disease. In this analysis based on evidential relationships of the biological characteristics of MSCs, especially umbilical cord (UC)-derived MSCs as well as the first clinical trial using MSCs for COVID-19 treatment, we discuss the use of UC-MSCs to improve the symptoms of COVID-19 in patients. ©The Author(s) 2020.

For example, the extent to which social media platforms contribute to enhancing public health awareness and prevention during epidemic disease transmission is currently unknown. Doubtlessly, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents a great challenge at the global level, aggressively affecting large cities and public gatherings and thereby having substantial impacts on many health care systems worldwide as a result of its rapid spread. Each country has its capacity and reacts according to its perception of threat, economy, health care policy, and the health care system structure. Furthermore, we noted a lack of research focusing on the role of social media campaigns in public health awareness and public protection against the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan as a developing country. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of social media platforms on public health protection against the COVID-19 pandemic via public health awareness and public health behavioral changes as mediating factors in Jordan. Methods: A quantitative approach and several social media platforms were used to collect data via web questionnaires in Jordan, and a total of 2555 social media users were sampled. This study used structural equation modeling to analyze and verify the study variables. Results: The main findings revealed that the use of social media platforms had a significant positive influence on public health protection against COVID-19 as a pandemic. Public health awareness and public health behavioral changes significantly acted as partial mediators in this relationship. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of the use of social media interventions on public health protection against COVID-19 while taking public health awareness and behavioral changes into account as mediators should be helpful when developing any health promotion strategy plan. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the use of social media platforms can positively influence awareness of public health behavioral changes and public protection against COVID-19. Public health authorities may use social media platforms as an effective tool to increase public health awareness through dissemination of brief messages to targeted populations. However, more research is needed to validate how social media channels can be used to improve health knowledge and adoption of healthy behaviors in a cross-cultural context. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Since these restrictions have a negative impact on the economy, there exists a strong incentive to relax these policies while protecting public health. Using a modified SEIR epidemiological model, this paper explores the costs and benefits associated with the sequential release of specific groups based on age and risk from lockdown and social distancing measures. The results in this paper suggest that properly designed staggered-release policies can do better than simultaneous-release policies in terms of protecting the most vulnerable members of a population, reducing health risks overall, and increasing economic activity. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

As of June 26, 2020, over 9.4 million cases of infection, including 482,730 deaths, had been confirmed across 216 countries. To combat a devastating virus pandemic, numerous studies on vaccine development are urgently being accelerated.

As the world is struggling to minimize the transmission of this devastating disease, several strategies are being actively deployed to develop therapeutic interventions. Pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers are relentlessly working to investigate experimental, repurposed or FDA-approved drugs on a compassionate basis and novel biologics for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis and treatment. Presently, a tremendous surge of COVID-19 clinical trials are advancing through different stages. Among currently registered clinical efforts, ~86% are centered on testing small molecules or antibodies either alone or in combination with immunomodulators. The rest ~14% of clinical efforts are aimed at evaluating vaccines and convalescent plasma-based therapies to mitigate the disease's symptoms. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current therapeutic modalities being evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Methods: A survey with 12 questions was shared with all IDF-SACA member organizations, in 18 countries. A descriptive analysis was performed and a multivariate cluster analysis technique pam (partitioning around medoids) was applied. Results: Two groups of countries were identified. The first group, mostly countries with stricter measures to contain the spread of the virus, reported more difficulties (limitations in accessing basic or health needs) and fears (concerns regarding the impact of the pandemic); whereas most of the second group consisted of countries with less restrictive measures, and reported fewer difficulties. Only 37% responded that a policy was put into place to protect individuals with diabetes, either delivering their medicines and supplies at home (16%) or providing them at once enough for 2–3 months (21%). All respondents reported that one of the main fear was to “be infected and not to receive adequate treatment” and/or “getting infected if going to the hospital or medical appointments”. Conclusion: Most of the SACA countries failed to implement timely measures to protect individuals with diabetes, which may severely impact individuals, health systems and economies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Barring the essential services, most of the business activities and transport sectors have been suspended and an unprecedented lockdown imposed over major economies in the world. South-East Asian regions, such as India and China, were no different. As a result, the pollutant level has gone down over these regions, and the air quality improved somewhat better than it was before the lockdown. This study uses satellite retrievals and attempts to estimate the extent of the reduction of major pollutants, like carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in India and China during January to April, 2020. We have calculated anomalies of pollutants during the lockdown period relative to their long-term records. NO2, which has significant emissions from the transport sector, is reduced on an average by 17% over India and 25% over China. SO2, which mainly emits from power plants, shows significant reductions (approx. 17%) especially over the Eastern sector of India. CO is found to be reduced by 6.5% over north-central China. The differential reduction was attributed to man made versus natural activities. This study is helpful to policy makers in mitigating the air-pollution on a long-term perspective. © The Author(s).

We provide insight on the impact that health care restriction has made on neurosurgical activity in Latin Iberoamerica. Methods: We performed an internet-based survey among presidents and members of the societies of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (FLANC). We blindly analyzed information regarding local conditions and their impact on neurosurgical praxis using SPSS software. Results: Information came from 21 countries. Sixteen society presidents reported having suspended regular activities and deferring local scheduled congresses, 14 reported mandatory isolation by government, and 4 instituted a telemedicine project. Four-hundred eighty-six colleagues, mean age 49 years, reported a mean 79% reduction in their neurosurgical praxis. Seventy-six percent of neurosurgeons have savings to self-support for 3–6 months if restrictions are long lasting. Conclusions: Stopping activities among societies of the FLANC, together with a drop of 79% of neurosurgical praxis, adds to deficits in provider's protection equipment and increasing demand for attention in the health care systems, representing a huge financial risk to their sustainability. Neurosurgeons should be involved in local policies to protect health and economy. Telemedicine represents an excellent solution, avoiding another pandemic of severe diseases across all-specialties as nonessential care can turn essential if left untreated. Financial support and ethics code review is needed to battle this new disease, designated the occupational disease of the decade, that continues to scrag the health care system. Times of crisis are times of great opportunities for humanity to evolve. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Not only is the infection inflicting significant morbidity and mortality, but there has also been a significant strain to the health care system and the economy. COVID-19 typically presents as viral pneumonia, occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. However, emerging evidence suggests that it has a significant impact on the cardiovascular (CV) system by direct myocardial damage, severe systemic inflammatory response, hypoxia, right heart strain secondary to ARDS and lung injury, and plaque rupture secondary to inflammation. Primary cardiac manifestations include acute myocarditis, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and abnormal clotting. Several consensus documents have been released to help manage CV disease during this pandemic. In this review, we summarize key cardiac manifestations, their management, and future implications. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.  antihypertensive agent; chloroquine; corticosteroid; hydroxychloroquine; immunoglobulin; immunomodulating agent; lopinavir plus ritonavir; low molecular weight heparin; remdesivir; ribavirin; tocilizumab; adverse outcome; artificial ventilation; atrioventricular block; brain hemorrhage; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular effect; clinical feature; coronavirus disease 2019; deep vein thrombosis; drug use; electrolyte disturbance; extracorporeal oxygenation; heart arrhythmia; heart bundle branch block; heart disease; heart infarction; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart muscle injury; heart muscle ischemia; heart output; heart ventricle arrhythmia; hemolytic anemia; human; hypertension; immunotherapy; intracranial hypertension; ischemia; lung embolism; pandemic; pathogenesis; priority journal; QT prolongation; QTc prolongation; respiratory alkalosis; Review; thrombocytopenia; thrombosis; torsade des pointes; transfusion related acute lung injury; venous thromboembolism; cardiovascular disease; complication; Coronavirus infection; myocarditis; pandemic; pathology; virology; virus pneumonia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Myocarditis; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Greening the Post-pandemic Recovery in the G20 Rebuilding G20 economies after the COVID-19 pandemic requires rethinking what type of economy we need and want in the future. Simply reviving the existing ‘brown’ economy will exacerbate irreversible climate change and other environmental risks. For G20 economies, investing in a workable and affordable green transition is essential. A good place to start is learning what worked and what did not from previous efforts to green the economic recovery during the 2008–2009 Great Recession, examining the cases of the United States and South Korea. Policies for a sustained economic recovery amount to much more than just short-term fiscal stimulus. Transitioning from fossil fuels to a sustainable low-carbon economy will require long-term commitments (5–10 years) of public spending and pricing reforms. The priorities for public spending include support for private sector green innovation and infrastructure, development of smart grids, transport systems, charging station networks, and sustainable cities. Pricing carbon and pollution, and removing fossil-fuel subsidies, can accelerate the transition, raise revenues for the necessary public investments, and lower the overall cost of the green transition. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies. © 2020 Li et al.

It is not important in which sector it operates, whether it is a private or public one, but profits and safety are two elements every enterprise is not able to function without. The low performance of these two measures can cause a number of difficulties for managers. To avoid this, leading companies, especially the smallest ones, should optimize the trade credit management policy. Most often, SMEs' (small and medium-sized enterprises) owners try to work together as part of a group purchasing organization, which positively affects trade credit management. The aim of the paper is to present the trade credit management strategy in Polish group purchasing organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study uses data on the construction sector because it is one of the most important segments of the Polish economy, which is financed to a large extent with trade credit. The paper indicates the mechanisms whose applications allowed SMEs operating in purchasing groups to change trade credit management strategies in such a way that these units could operate calmly and safely in the market. These changes could be observed in purchasing goods with a large reserve, strictly controlling all receivables, switching to cash sales or limiting sales on long-term trade credit. The analysis showed that enterprises changed trade credit management strategies from moderately conservative to highly conservative. © 2020 by the authors.

Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. Methods: Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, and Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratope binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. Results: We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, Inhibitory Concentration50 (IC50), MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition. Conclusion: The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2. © 2020 The Author(s).

COVID-19 is unique in that it is spread through everyday contact with other people. Therefore, social protective measures, beyond medical protective measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, border closures, and human tracing are initiated to control the spread of COVID-19. Such responses have produced secondary issues such as drastic changes in people’s way of life and work, housing instability, economic shock, and privacy issues. This paper examines the four domains of urban and regional issues related to the secondary impact of COVID-19, including (1) social distancing, urban structure, community, and density; (2) housing affordability; (3) lockdowns, border closures, reshoring, and regional economic recovery; and (4) smart city technology, contact tracing, and privacy. The following six recommendations have been proposed. First, institutional and cultural factors are more important than urban features, such as population density. To handle infectious diseases such as COVID-19, it is important to build systems, technology, infrastructure, and urban structures that can strengthen resilience instead of implementing a directionless policy of dispersion. Second, it is necessary to improve accessibility to essential services at the community level, including medical facilities and food supply. Third, continuous effort should be made to boost housing affordability, as it is directly related to people’s basic life. Fourth, measures are needed to protect those people who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. There is also the need to restore global trade and economic relations. Fifth, since data technology-based COVID-19 control raises the human tracing and privacy issue, we must ensure the principles of privacy management, such as transparency and voluntary consent, are being met. Finally, since COVID-19 is spread through people, individuals may become anxious and fearful of others without grounds; this may increase prejudice and hatred, including xenophobia. Significant social effort is needed to overcome such ill-defined anxiety and fear and maintain a healthy civil society. © 2020 The Institute of Urban Sciences. community; COVID-19; density; housing; pandemic; privacy; regional economy; smart city; urban and regional planning  The challenges and opportunities of a global health crisis: the management and business implications of COVID-19 from an Asian perspective On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic. As the evolution and implications of the COVID-19 crisis are still unfolding, we posit that exploring the experiences and strategic responses of Asian countries may shed light on ways to combat COVID-19 for the rest of the world. In this paper, we first articulate the importance of resilience, strategic agility, and entrepreneurship in the context of the fight against COVID-19. Then, with the focus on China, South Korea, and Singapore, we discuss the impact COVID-19 is having on economies and businesses, governmental support for businesses and societies, and implications for global supply chain disruptions. We hope that the global health system will recover quickly, and that the world economy will be revitalized with the contributions and collaboration of science (including social science), industry, and governments. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the aim is to investigate the consequences of the health emergency on diversified farms, their reactions, and their agricultural and rural policy needs in order to overcome the crisis. The research path investigates five farms of central Italy through semi-structured interviews. The identified case studies are characterized by the heterogeneity of features and farms' activities. These activities include agritourism, on-farm processing of plant and animal products (mainly olive oils, fruits, and cheese), bio-energy production, tastings and leisure activities, educational farms, and contracting of farm equipment. A qualitative-quantitative analysis based on textual analysis techniques, particularly content and sentiment analysis, was performed. The results highlight the importance of farm diversification and networks in farms' strategies in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis. Furthermore, the presence of both synergies and trade-offs in different types of diversification is found. These results have interesting policy implications that should be more explicitly taken into account to target the next rural development measures. © 2020 by the authors.

The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)–B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Chronic diseases; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Immune deficiency; Pandemic; Pollutants; SARS-CoV-2; Xenobiotics angiotensin converting enzyme 2; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; fossil fuel; heavy metal; multi walled nanotube; pesticide; xenobiotic agent; antivirus agent; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; airborne particle; Article; biochemistry; biophysics; cell function; cell level; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; dietary supplement; economic aspect; human; immune deficiency; immune system; immunopathology; immunotoxicity; intestine flora; ionizing radiation; lifestyle; long term exposure; macrophage; pandemic; particulate matter; pollutant; prevalence; protein expression; public health; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; ultraviolet B radiation; virus immunity; vulnerable population; air pollutant; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diet; drug effect; epidemic; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; time; toxicity; virus pneumonia; Air Pollutants; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diet; Epidemics; Humans; Immune System; Pandemics; Pesticides; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Time; Xenobiotics COVID-19 Outbreak: An Overview Background: In late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Summary: A few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientific community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays are key to case identification, contact tracing, identification of the animal source, and implementation of control measures. © 2020 S.

The study is developed within a multiscale framework accounting for the interaction of different spatial scales, from the small scale of the virus itself and cells, to the large scale of individuals and further up to the collective behaviour of populations. An interdisciplinary vision is developed thanks to the contributions of epidemiologists, immunologists and economists as well as those of mathematical modellers. The first part of the contents is devoted to understanding the complex features of the system and to the design of a modelling rationale. The modelling approach is treated in the second part of the paper by showing both how the virus propagates into infected individuals, successfully and not successfully recovered, and also the spatial patterns, which are subsequently studied by kinetic and lattice models. The third part reports the contribution of research in the fields of virology, epidemiology, immune competition, and economy focussed also on social behaviours. Finally, a critical analysis is proposed looking ahead to research perspectives. © 2020 The Author(s). complexity; COVID-19; immune competition; intracellular infection dynamics; living systems; multiscale problems; networks; SARS-CoV-2; spatial patterns; viral quasispecies; virus structure modelling Economics; Viruses; Collective behaviour; Critical analysis; Lattice models; Multi-scale frameworks; Multi-scale Modeling; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Social behaviour; Spatial patterns; Diseases Research on intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics [面向重大疫情应急防控的智能机器人系统研究] In recent years, SARS virus, MERS coronavirus, and other global pandemics have occurred frequently. The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused more than 3.7 million infected people and 260000 deaths over 210 countries around the world from December 2019 to May 7, 2020, which has seriously affected the safety of people, the stability of social order, and the development of the economy. Therefore, it is urgent to explore and implement new prevention and control programs for such major pandemics. With the development of robots and artificial intelligence technologies, various intelligent robots for emergency prevention and control in complex conditions have emerged, and they have played paramount roles in disease prevention and control, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing. Based on the problems of insufficient supply of materials and heavy disinfection tasks during the prevention and control of major outbreaks, we study the systematic procedures and applications of medical material handling robots, multi-scene disinfection robots, medical assistant robots, prevention and control robots, and production resumption robots. Moreover, we comparatively analyze the current situation of key technologies of pandemic emergency prevention and control robots, such as environmental perception, autonomous navigation, motion planning, and 5G communication technology. In conclusion, we put forward a technical prospect of intelligent robot systems for emergency prevention and control of major pandemics. © 2020, Science Press.

The epidemic lifetime should be accurate so that timely and remedial steps are determined. These include the closing of borders schools, suspension of community and commuting services. The forecast of an outbreak effectively is a very necessary but difficult task. A predictive model that provides the best possible forecast is a great challenge for machine learning with only a few samples of training available. This work proposes and examines a prediction model based on a deep extreme learning machine (DELM). This methodology is used to carry out an experiment based on the recent Wuhan coronavirus outbreak. An optimized prediction model that has been developed, namely DELM, is demonstrated to be able to make a prediction that is fairly best. The results show that the new methodology is useful in developing an appropriate forecast when the samples are far from abundant during the critical period of the disease. During the investigation, it is shown that the proposed approach has the highest accuracy rate of 97.59% with 70% of training, 30% of test and validation. Simulation results validate the prediction effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2020 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

However, this may not be feasible in complex situations like the current global pandemic. We argue that in such environments where Knightian uncertainty plays a big role, the behaviour of countries, sectors of the economy, and individuals may be characterised by procedural rationality. Instead of focusing on the outcome, it is argued that the decision-maker draws upon similar experiences and follows a consistent procedure. © 2020 Economic and Political Weekly.

In this study the focus is on assessing the impact on affected sectors, such as aviation, tourism, retail, capital markets, MSMEs, and oil. International and internal mobility is restricted, and the revenues generated by travel and tourism, which contributes 9.2% of the GDP, will take a major toll on the GDP growth rate. Aviation revenues will come down by USD 1.56 billion. Oil has plummeted to 18-year low of $ 22 per barrel in March, and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have withdrawn huge amounts from India, about USD 571.4 million. While lower oil prices will shrink the current account deficit, reverse capital flows will expand it. Rupee is continuously depreciating. MSMEs will undergo a severe cash crunch. The crisis witnessed a horrifying mass exodus of such floating population of migrants on foot, amidst countrywide lockdown. Their worries primarily were loss of job, daily ration, and absence of a social security net. India must rethink on her development paradigm and make it more inclusive. COVID 19 has also provided some unique opportunities to India. There is an opportunity to participate in global supply chains, multinationals are losing trust in China. To ‘Make in India’, some reforms are needed, labour reforms being one of them. © 2020 SAGE Publications.

The dialysis population is vulnerable and the dialysis facility is critical in maintaining operations and avoiding disease transmission. The present information regarding the clinical features of COVID-19 infection in the dialysis population was collected, and the useful measures of COVID-19 infection prevention and infection control in the dialysis facilities were summarized. Leadership, education, preparedness, management, and recovery phase were determined to be the critical procedures. It is hoped this updated interim review might provide information for medical professionals to take proactive action to best prepare and mitigate damage when facing the COVID-19 pandemic challenge. © 2020 The Authors.

During this critical situation when most are indulged and involved in finding the causes and solution of the problem, a very different aspect catches my attention and that is effective communication approaches added through innovative techniques by leaders, hundreds of creative people and think tanks whose efforts resulted as information medicine to protect life and economy which is in danger at the time of rapidly increasing Novel Corona Virus (Covid-19). Some of the communication techniques introduced and liked by millions of people around the world are Clapping Act, Banging of Thali at the door steps or at roof tops, Lightening of Lamps, Candles, Flash Lights of Mobile Phones, efforts of global leaders along with Video Conferencing by the Indian Prime Minister Mr. Modi and the announcement of lock down to break the chain of spread of Corona virus. The research methodology opted to assess these communication channels and its approaches, media sources and innovative techniques is based on observation, interpretation and analysis on primary and secondary phase. As a result, we have seen the control over COVID-19 up-to some extent, the controlled death rate and economy level in positive numbers. The outcome of this paper suggests that the information spread through various effective communication approaches along with media sources works as information medicine to safeguard life on Earth in context with the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020 Amity University.

In this challenging situation, older people are vulnerable to the infection and the secondary effects of the pandemic and need special attention. To evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on older people, it is important to balance the successful pandemic control and active management of secondary consequences. These considerations are particularly salient in the Asian context, with its diversity among countries in terms of sociocultural heritage, healthcare setup and availability of resources. Thus, the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia summarized the considerations of Asian countries focusing on responses and difficulties in each country, impacts of health inequity related to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed recommendations for older people, which are germane to the Asian context. More innovative services should be developed to address the increasing demands for new approaches to deliver healthcare in these difficult times and to establish resilient healthcare systems for older people.

Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities—Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2, and SO2 are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities. This helps in understanding the magnitude of actual damage and brings out a more holistic picture of the damages related to lockdown. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

A critical situation pushes human behaviour towards different directions with some aspects of behaviour being irrevocable. COVID-19 pandemic is not a normal crisis, and to control the spread of disease various measures were taken including complete and then partial lockdown. Since all elements of the economy are intricately interrelated with public health measures and lockdown, this resulted in economic instabilities of the nations hinting towards change in market dynamics. In every market, consumers are the drivers of the market competitiveness, growth and economic integration. With economic instability, consumers are also experiencing a transformation in behaviour, though how much of transformation experienced during the crisis will sustain is a question. This article looks at the consumer behaviour during COVID-19 crisis and in the subsequent lockdown period when the world stood still for more than a quarter of a year. Further, the article attempts to weave through the maze of literature available about consumer behaviour in normal times and in crisis times, strengthens it with the rapid assessment reports culled out by the different consulting organisations during lockdown phase, substantiates the same with first-hand telling and retelling of experiences by consumers and professionals with marketing background to bring up a hypothesis of the pandemic affecting a paradigm shift from consumer materialism to consumer spiritualism. The proposition offers further testable hypotheses for future research to understand consumer sentiments or requirement in buying ‘what is enough’ within the marketing context and how it can be reinforced post-COVID crisis for ensuring sustainability of business models. It would also be interesting to explore the correlates of this forced consumer behaviour with other variables such as learning from crisis, changing needs, personality, nationality, culture, new market segment and age to develop new models of consumer behaviour. © 2020 SAGE Publications.

The virus, unlike other recent epidemics, has resulted in the closing of many schools, businesses, and healthcare facilities. Much of the virus's impact is yet to be determined, however, what has been observed is that children are much less affected than adults and their case fatality is low across the world. Although the adults who care for children at home and in healthcare settings may be at risk, there are many strategies that are being implemented across the nation to address viral spread and move toward business as usual. Government policies that are currently being developed should consider the impact they will have on public health and the economy because they are both intimately intertwined in the daily workings of our nation. We urge consideration of the longterm impact that the pandemic may have on children. Furthermore, we insist that public and private institutions at all levels consider policies and programs that account for children and the indirect and direct deleterious effects that the pandemic is having on their development and well-being. Children in need of surgery have different considerations compared with adult patients with regard to decision-making, convalescence, and long-term outcomes. As children are our future, let us consider mitigation strategies and solutions that can give them the best chance at success. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.  child health; coronavirus disease 2019; disease severity; economic aspect; health care personnel; health care planning; health education; hospital admission; human; intraoperative period; intubation; model; patient care; perioperative period; postoperative period; preoperative period; prevalence; priority journal; Review; surgery; United States; wellbeing; child; Coronavirus infection; economic recession; elective surgery; endotracheal intubation; extubation; family; mass screening; pandemic; perioperative period; procedures; protective equipment; severity of illness index; time to treatment; virus pneumonia; Airway Extubation; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Economic Recession; Elective Surgical Procedures; Family; Health Personnel; Humans; Intubation, Intratracheal; Mass Screening; Pandemics; Perioperative Care; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; Time-to-Treatment Lessons from SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Evolution, disease dynamics and future The COVID-19 pandemic is rising at an unprecedented rate. The surging number of deaths every day, global lockdown and travel restrictions have resulted in huge losses to society. The impact is massive and will leave a historical footprint. The Spanish Flu of 1918, which was the last pandemic that had a similar impact, was shadowed under the consequences of World War I. All the brilliance, strength and economies of countries worldwide are aimed at fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The knowledge about coronavirus dynamics, its nature and epidemiology are expanding every day. The present review aims to summarize the structure, epidemiology, symptoms, statistical status of the disease status, intervention strategies and deliberates the lessons learnt during the pandemic. The intervention approaches, antiviral drug repurposing and vaccine trials are intensified now. Statistical interpretations of disease dynamics and their projections may help the decision-makers. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. COVID-19; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2  A review on sars-cov-2 virology, pathophysiology, animal models, and anti-viral interventions Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic and transmissible CoV that is presently plaguing the global human population and economy. No proven effective antiviral therapy or vaccine currently exists, and supportive care remains to be the cornerstone treatment. Through previous lessons learned from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV studies, scientific groups worldwide have rapidly expanded the knowledge pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 virology that includes in vitro and in vivo models for testing of antiviral therapies and randomized clinical trials. In the present narrative, we review SARS-CoV-2 virology, clinical features, pathophysiology, and animal models with a specific focus on the antiviral and adjunctive therapies currently being tested or that require testing in animal models and randomized clinical trials. © 2020 by the authors.

This thesis was particularly confirmed by the global events of the beginning of the third decade of the 21st century, when the spread of the COVID-19 virus revealed the helplessness of humanity in the face of a pandemic. Only intensive scientific work, having an interdisciplinary character, gives hope to stop the development of the spread of the virus. It turned out that it is scientists who are necessary to reduce mortality and morbidity, as well as the negative effects of a pandemic on the economy and public health. In this regard, it is worth discussing whether the scientific work of scientists is satisfying for them? Nowadays, the scientist is demanded for immediate effects of scientific research, implementation of inventions tailored to the emerging needs, and quick solutions to the problems of a dynamically changing society. However, along with the growing social expectations towards researchers, is their work increasingly appreciated? The aim of this article is getting to assess the level of satisfaction with scientific work among researchers and to identify the factors that influence its level. The article presents the results of research conducted on a random sample of 763 academics from Poland. The conducted scientific studies have established that: (1) The level of satisfaction of researchers concerning their own scientific work depends on employment conditions, as well as the social significance of the research carried out, (2) the level of satisfaction from work is closely correlated with the scientific opportunities of researchers (that is, the possibility of academic and didactic work, contact with students and co-workers) and negatively correlated with the necessity to carry out administrative work, and (3) the majority of Polish researchers are proud of their scientific achievements and treat their profession as a passion or vocation. © 2020 by the authors.

The epidemic has led to interruptions in supply and decline in demand in some industries, causing supply chain risk spread through the industry chain to the entire network, which is very likely to trigger systemic risks. In order to simulate the risk contagion effect of the regional industrial supply chain under the influence of the epidemic, a network cascading failure model based on China's regional industrial network is proposed. We simulate the propagation of production suspension and liquidity risk in the case of unexpected interruption of supply and decline in demand in Hubei province as well as the rest part of China. The results show that risk propagation exhibits an abrupt transition with a critical time point. The risk spread is relatively slow and stable before the critical point. Once the critical point is exceeded, the accelerated spread makes the entire industrial network blackout in a short period. We also show that under the impact of supply-side and demand-side shocks, different industries have heterogeneous effects on systemic risk levels. re industrial network blackout in a short period. We also show that different industries have heterogeneous impact on systemic risk of the industry network under shocks from supply and demand side. © 2020, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

A return to pre-pandemic growth patterns will take time and depend on the depth and extent of the recession sparked by COVID-19. The recovery phase will overlap with global efforts to deal with the evolving climate crisis. For the tourism industry to thrive in a future world it must look beyond the temptation of adopting strategies based on a return to the pre-COVID-19 normal of the past and instead seek to understand how it should respond to the emerging transformation of the global economy to carbon neutrality. Many of the lessons that emerged from the pandemic can be applied to strategies to deal with climate change. Of most interest is the success of strategies such as “flattening the curve”. Application of similar strategies plus adoption of the circular economy model to wind back Green House Gas emissions will help avert the global environmental disaster that will occur if global temperatures continue to increase. These strategies point to what a future carbon-neutral economic production system might look like, the path to which could offer the tourism industry numerous opportunities to transform from the current model that favours a high resource consumption model to one that is environmentally friendly and resource neutral. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

A space remote sensing dynamic monitoring system for urban complex is proposed and constructed from the aspects of application demand, technical method, remote sensing products, management release, etc. Using the system, the construction progress and surrounding water environment monitoring of the urban complex of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital are carried out. The construction progress of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital is monitored by high-resolution optical satellites such as Gaofen-2, Jilin-1 and Pleiades, which is identical with the construction progress in the news report and the officially published hospital area. The construction intensity of Huoshenshan Hospital is monitored by the high-resolution night light satellite Jilin-1, most areas of the construction plant are under high-intensity construction at night. The water environment around Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital is monitored by the hyperspectral satellite Zhuhai-1, the construction process has no significant impact on the surrounding water environment. The surface stability of Huoshenshan Hospital and Leishenshan Hospital before construction is analyzed by the high-resolution radar satellite Sentinel-1A, there is no obvious surface subsidence in the construction area of Huoshenshan Hospital, and there are different degrees of surface subsidence signals in the surrounding areas of Leishenshan Hospital. In the critical period of fighting against the coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19), it has met the public’s attention needs and plays a certain role in stabilizing social mood. A retrospective monitoring of the collapse of Xinjia hotel in Quanzhou is carried out to provide data reference for accident liability analysis. The deformation of Xinjia hotel is mainly caused by the south wall, and the foundation settlement is not obvious. This result is consistent with the fact that the hotel collapses to the south, and the main reason for the collapse is the instability of the internal structure of the building, rather than the uneven ground settlement. The effectiveness of the system is verified. © 2020, Editorial Board of Geomatics and Information Science of Wuhan University. All right reserved.

In this paper, a structural equation (SEM) model was proposed to compare risk knowledge, risk perception, risk aversion attitudes and behavioral intentions towards rural tourism. According to the empirical results, there was a large proportion of tourists showing preference for rural tourism recently. Potential participants in rural tourism paid most attention to the performance realization and time cost of scenic spots, while the psycho-social risk posed by COVID-19 had little impact. The inherent risk nature of risk aversion attitudes made knowledge of the pneumonia risk less effective in reducing tourists’ intentions, while knowledge of the pneumonia risk was more effective in alleviating the risk perception that potential tourists have towards rural tourism. With regard to travel intention and recommendation intention of rural tourism, the negative impacts of risk aversion attitude were more considerable compared to risk perception. Meanwhile, the parallel mediating effect of risk perception and risk aversion attitude in rural tourism needed to be taken into consideration together. © 2020 by the authors.

The importance of China as a player in the Global Economy This article describes similarities and differences in the response of governments and the international community to the current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic. It expresses the opinion that the speed and scale of the response to COVID-19 are affected by the important role that China plays in the global economy. By contrast, insufficient and less timely action was initially undertaken in West African countries during the 2014 Ebola epidemic. It concludes by stating why preparedness for and response to all disease outbreaks, also in countries of lower economic importance, should become a priority in the global health agenda. © 2020 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene  Africa; Betacoronavirus; China; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disaster planning; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; Ebolavirus; economics; epidemic; global health; human; international cooperation; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Africa, Western; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disaster Planning; Disease Outbreaks; Ebolavirus; Global Health; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; International Cooperation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral Covid-19: An opportunity to create a comprehensive and holistic indian management perspective We should use the COVID-19 as an opportunity to create a comprehensive and holistic Indian management perspective. There are a number of arguments behind it such as our success for many centuries as a culture and as an economy, importance of culture and context, availability of rich literature, lack of a comprehensive and holistic Indian management perspective, and lastly, using COVID-19 as a shock therapy to get out of the business as usual mode. To be an economic superpower, we need to bring something new, which is unique to us, with which we can relate, can embrace, and can enjoy for a long time.

The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown. However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features. A full comprehension of the mechanisms driving the evolution of animal CoVs will help better understand the emergence, spreading, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. © 2020 The Authors Animal coronaviruses; COVID-19; Genetic plasticity; Host switch; Novel human coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Tissue tropism case report; clinical article; comprehension; coronavirus disease 2019; human; nonhuman; review; SARS coronavirus; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; tropism; animal; Betacoronavirus; classification; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus infection; disease model; genetics; isolation and purification; molecular evolution; pandemic; veterinary medicine; virology; virus pneumonia; zoonosis; Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronaviridae; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Models, Animal; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Zoonoses COVID-19 and Bangladesh: Challenges and How to Address Them As the coronavirus outbreak quickly surges worldwide, many countries are adopting non-therapeutic preventive measures, which include travel bans, remote office activities, country lockdown, and most importantly, social distancing. However, these measures face challenges in Bangladesh, a lower-middle-income economy with one of the world's densest populations. Social distancing is difficult in many areas of the country, and with the minimal resources the country has, it would be extremely challenging to implement the mitigation measures. Mobile sanitization facilities and temporary quarantine sites and healthcare facilities could help mitigate the impact of the pandemic at a local level. A prompt, supportive, and empathic collaboration between the Government, citizens, and health experts, along with international assistance, can enable the country to minimize the impact of the pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Anwar, Nasrullah and Hosen. community mitigation; COVID-19; healthcare; infection prevention and control; non-therapeutic intervention; novel coronavirus; testing  NOx emission reduction and recovery during COVID-19 in East China Since its first confirmed case at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic in three months with more than 1.4 million confirmed cases worldwide, as of early April 2020. Quantifying the changes of pollutant emissions due to COVID-19 and associated governmental control measures is crucial to understand its impacts on economy, air pollution, and society. We used the WRF-GC model and the tropospheric NO2 column observations retrieved by the TROPOMI instrument to derive the top-down NOx emission change estimation between the three periods: P1 (January 1st to January 22nd, 2020), P2 (January 23rd, Wuhan lockdown, to February 9th, 2020), and P3 (February 10th, back-to-work day, to March 12th, 2020). We found that NOx emissions in East China averaged during P2 decreased by 50% compared to those averaged during P1. The NOx emissions averaged during P3 increased by 26% compared to those during P2. Most provinces in East China gradually regained some of their NOx emissions after February 10, the official back-to-work day, but NOx emissions in most provinces have not yet to return to their previous levels in early January. NOx emissions in Wuhan, the first epicenter of COVID-19, had no sign of emission recovering by March 12. A few provinces, such as Zhejiang and Shanxi, have recovered fast, with their averaged NOx emissions during P3 almost back to pre-lockdown levels. © 2020 by the authors.

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway.

However, it has often been invisible in the eyes of policy and policymaking. As soon as the spread of Covid-19 started impacting local and national economies across the globe, many industry and policy bodies rushed into researching the impact of Covid-19 on the creative and cultural industries (CCIs) and the workers in the sector. The paper offers an insight into the key concerns of these organizations through the meta-analysis of the survey and research projects that are currently being undertaken in the context of the UK. The results highlight common concerns in relation to visible and invisible issues that need addressing in the sector. The paper concludes by questioning if Covid-19 represents a moment of crisis for the sector or has simply exposed the unsustainable price of creative and cultural work. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Today, the Covid-19 is a global issue, and the world economy can be interpreted as almost at the standstill. In this context, this study aims to discuss the potential first reactions of short and long term global economic impacts of the pandemic through sectors by assessing its costs according to the data announced for both the world and Turkey. In addition, this study tries to put forth possible economic and political scenarios for the post-pandemic world. Materials and methods: This is a review article that summarizes the current reports and discussions about the economic consequences of this historical event, and tries to make some inferences considering them. Results: This pandemic has severe adverse effects on the employees, customers, supply chains and financial markets, in brief, most probably it will cause a global economic recession. Nevertheless, due to the uncertainty of the end of this pandemic, both the length and scale of this contraction are not predictable. Conclusion: It takes a while for the world economy to recover from the contraction. It seems that this pandemic will lead to a permanent shift in the world and its politics, especially in health, security, trade, employment, agriculture, manufacturing goods production and science policies. Since this new world might provide great opportunities for some countries that did not dominate world production before, governments should develop new strategies to adjust the new world order without much delay. © TÜBİTAK.

In contrast to the existing studies, this research examines the effects of economic and social isolation as dimensions of globalization. The present paper allows underpinning the impact on the Chinese economic development of the isolation phenomenon as a consequence of coronavirus (COVID-19). To this end, annual time–frequency data is used to achieve the hypothesized claims. The study resolutions include (1) the existence of a long-run association between the outlined variables; (2) the long-run estimates suggest that the Chinese economy, over the investigated period, is inelastic to pollutant-driven economic growth; and (3) the Chinese isolation is less responsive to its economic growth while the country political willpower is elastic as demonstrated by a government commitment to dampen the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. This confinement is marked by the aggressive response by the government officials resolute by flattening the exponential impact of the pandemic. Based on these robust results, some far-reaching policy implications are underlined in the concluding remarks section. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

As the sudden emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 is endangering global health and the economy, the development of strategies to contain the virus's spread are urgently needed. At present, various diagnostic kits to test for SARS-CoV-2 are available for use to initiate appropriate treatment faster and to limit further spread of the virus. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 or potential clinical benefits. In addition, institutions and companies worldwide are working tirelessly to develop treatments and vaccines against COVID-19. However, no drug or vaccine has yet been specifically approved for COVID-19. Given the urgency of the outbreak, we focus here on recent advances in the diagnostics, treatment, and vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 infection, helping to guide strategies to address the current COVID-19 pandemic. © The author(s).

We apply wavelet coherence analysis to economic policy uncertainty (EPU) data and monthly sector volatility of the S&P 500 index from January 2008 to May 2020. The results reveal that EPU in terms of COVID-19 has influenced the sector volatility more than the global financial crisis (GFC) for all sectors. Furthermore, EPU leads the volatility of all sectors during COVID-19 pandemic, while some sector's volatilities lead EPU during the GFC. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

As on date, around 8.20 million confirmed cases including death of around 443,815 have been reported. The present review deals with the history and origin of the COVID-19, its worldwide pandemic spread, symptoms and preventive measures as an attempt to create awareness of the fatal disease. © 2020 Deuton-X Ltd.

International economies are stalled and social isolation based on palpable fear of death remains the order of the day. The United States and other countries are moving toward resuming work activities and social interaction to boost economic recovery. While this makes financial sense, from a medical perspective our population has already suffered and will continue to suffer severe losses in the absence of a viable aggressive prophylaxis strategy for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we present a plan to address this problem. © 2020 Stricker and Fesler.

We undertook an online survey to measure the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine and its determinants in Indonesia. The WTP was assessed using a simple dichotomous contingent valuation approach and a linear regression model was used to assess its associated determinants. There were 1,359 respondents who completed the survey. In total, 78.3% (1,065) were willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine with a mean and median WTP of US$ 57.20 (95%CI: US$ 54.56, US$ 59.85) and US$ 30.94 (95%CI: US$ 30.94, US$ 30.94), respectively. Being a health-care worker, having a high income, and having high perceived risk were associated with higher WTP. These findings suggest that the WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high in Indonesia. This WTP information can be used to construct a payment model for a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. Nevertheless, to attain higher vaccine coverage, it may be necessary to partially subsidize the vaccine for those who are less wealthy and to design health promotion materials to increase the perceived risk for COVID-19 in the country. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The latter includes the use of electroencephalography (EEG) in clinical practice and research. We report a survey of the impact of COVID-19 on the use of clinical EEG in practice and research in several countries, and the recommendations of an international panel of experts for the safe application of EEG during and after this pandemic. Methods: Fifteen clinicians from 8 different countries and 25 researchers from 13 different countries reported the impact of COVID-19 on their EEG activities, the procedures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and precautions planned or already implemented during the reopening of EEG activities. Results: Of the 15 clinical centers responding, 11 reported a total stoppage of all EEG activities, while 4 reduced the number of tests per day. In research settings, all 25 laboratories reported a complete stoppage of activity, with 7 laboratories reopening to some extent since initial closure. In both settings, recommended precautions for restarting or continuing EEG recording included strict hygienic rules, social distance, and assessment for infection symptoms among staff and patients/participants. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic interfered with the use of EEG recordings in clinical practice and even more in clinical research. We suggest updated best practices to allow safe EEG recordings in both research and clinical settings. The continued use of EEG is important in those with psychiatric diseases, particularly in times of social alarm such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS) 2020.

Since the Indian economy was experiencing sluggish growth on the eve of the Covid-19 outbreak, the economic downturn could be severe, and the policy intervention would require a careful weighing of options and priorities. Given that policy space and resources are limited, policies that help manage the short-run crisis and yield significant long-run benefits should receive serious consideration. © 2020, ACCB Publishing.

This epidemic is still spreading and showing no signs of decreasing trend. Vaccination could be the only effective and economical means to control this pandemic. A number of research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have plunged into the race of vaccine development against COVID-19 which are in various stages of development. An intriguing fact of coronavirus infections is that in every decade of the 21st century there is a new major coronavirus epidemic, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and now COVID-19; and such epidemics are expected in future too. Since most of the biological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still obscure, the scientists are relying on the information available on SARS-CoV and to some extent on MERS-CoV for designing and developing COVID-19 vaccines. But there is a need of vigorous testing for immunogenicity, safety, efficacy, and level of protection conferred in the hosts. This review focuses on the challenges and prospects of vaccine development against COVID-19. It highlights seriousness, bottlenecks in vaccine development, possible vaccine candidates, different vaccine strategies, safety evaluation issues, and vaccine production processes pertaining to COVID-19 based on the knowledge acquired on SARS and MERS vaccine development in the past. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH COVID-19; MERS; SARS; spike protein; vaccine candidate; vaccine development  Evaluating the plausible application of advanced machine learnings in exploring determinant factors of present pandemic: A case for continent specific COVID-19 analysis Coronavirus disease, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COVID-19), has become a global health concern due to its unpredictable nature and lack of adequate medicines. Machine Learning (ML) models could be effective in identifying the most critical factors which are responsible for the overall fatalities caused by COVID-19. The functional capabilities of ML models in epidemiological research, especially for COVID-19, are not substantially explored. To bridge this gap, this study has adopted two advanced ML models, viz. Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM), to perform the regression modelling and provide subsequent interpretation. Five successive steps were followed to carry out the analysis: (1) identification of relevant key explanatory variables; (2) application of data dimensionality reduction for eliminating redundant information; (3) utilizing ML models for measuring relative influence (RI) of the explanatory variables; (4) evaluating interconnections between and among the key explanatory variables and COVID-19 case and death counts; (5) time series analysis for examining the rate of incidences of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Among the explanatory variables considered in this study, air pollution, migration, economy, and demographic factor were found to be the most significant controlling factors. Since a very limited research is available to discuss the superiority of ML models for identifying the key determinants of COVID-19, this study could be a reference for future public health research. Additionally, all the models and data used in this study are open source and freely available, thereby, reproducibility and scientific replication will be achievable easily. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to analyze the effects of COVID-19 on 56 global stock indices from October 15, 2019 to August 7, 2020 by using a complex network method. Furthermore, the change of the network structure is analyzed in depth by dividing the stock markets into developed, emerging and frontier markets. The findings reveal a structural change in the form of node changes, reduced connectivity and significant differences in the topological characteristics of the network, due to COVID-19. A contagion effect is also identified in the network structure of emerging markets, with the nodes behaving synchronously. The findings also reveal substantial clustering and homogeneity in the world stock market network, based on geographic positioning. Besides, the number of positive correlations in the global stock indices increased during the outbreak. The stock markets of France and Germany seem to be the most relevant developed markets, while Taiwan and Slovenia have this relevance in emerging and frontier markets. The findings of this study help regulators and practitioners to design important strategies in the light of varying stock market dynamics during COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors COVID-19; Minimum spanning tree; Network; Network topology; Stock markets  Influencers and COVID-19: reviewing key issues in press coverage across Australia, China, Japan, and South Korea As COVID-19 broke out across the Asia Pacific from December 2019, media coverage on its impacts proliferated online. Among these discourses, coverage on influencers was prominent, likely as many of the issues arising from COVID-19 contingencies – such as digitalization, public messaging, and misinformation – are cornerstones of this digital economy. In response, this cross-cultural study draws on a corpus of Australian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean online news articles published between January and May 2020, to understand how local news ecologies were parsing the impacts of COVID-19 on influencers. From the coding of 150 news articles guided by Grounded Theory, this article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on influencers, and influencers’ engagements with and reactions to the pandemic. Our study of individual governments’ past engagements with their influencer industries suggest that local backstories and contexts are crucial to decipher why news angles tend to pitch particular stories on influencers. © The Author(s) 2020. coronavirus; COVID-19; influencers; press coverage; social media; wanghong  COVID-19 geopolitics: silence and erasure in Cambodia and Myanmar in times of pandemic COVID-19 has become a global public health pandemic which requires scientific, technical, public policy and health system responses at multi-scales. COVID-19 is also a pandemic that is impacting socio-economic and political systems in profound ways. This paper briefly outlines why and how pandemics may expose uneven socio-economic geographies of vulnerability and risk, and also be thought of in relation to environmental and non-human challenges to our geopolitical map of territorial nation-states and sovereignties. In relation to Southeast Asia we argue that preexisting and ongoing political-economy linkages are shaping key responses to COVID-19. In particular, we consider the geopolitical and geoeconomic reasoning of Cambodia and Myanmar, and their relations with China. We reflect on the factors that shape their national responses in response to the pandemic, characterized by certain silences and erasures to their local geographies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Clinical evidences demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces detrimental levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and significant systemic organ damage. Currently, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19 or associated complications, and with the hope of a safe and effective vaccine in the distant future, the search for an answer is paramount. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a viable option due to their immunomodulatory effects and tissue repair and regeneration abilities. Studies have demonstrated that compassionate use of MSCs can reduce symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminate fluid buildup, and act as a regenerative technique for alveolar damage; all in a safe and effective way. With multiple autologous sources available for MSCs, each with their own respective limitations, allogenic umbilical cord (UC) and/or UC-derived Wharton’s jelly (WJ) seem to be best positioned source to harvest MSCs to treat COVID-19 and associated symptoms. As an allogenic source, UC is readily available, easily obtainable, and is rich in immunomodulatory and regenerative factors. In this manuscript, we reviewed the current evidences and explored the potential therapeutic use of allogenic UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although, preliminary preclinical and clinical studies indicate that their use is safe and potentially effective, more multi-center, randomized, controlled trials are needed to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2020, Japan Human Cell Society.

For some, location-aware applications are primarily a producer of geospatial Big Data required for vital geospatial analysis and visualization of the spread of the disease in a state of emergency. For others, comprehensive tracking of citizens constitutes a dangerous violation of fundamental rights. Commercial web-based location-aware applications both collect data and—through spatial analysis and connection to services—provide value to users. This value is what motivates users to share increasingly private and comprehensive data. The willingness of users to share data in return for services has been a key concern with web-based variants of the technology since the beginning. With a focus on two privacy preserving CoViD-19 contact tracking applications, this survey walks through the key steps of developing a privacy preserving context-aware application: from types of applications and business models, through architectures and privacy strategies, to representations. © 2020, The Author(s).

Therefore, firms are now trying to identify the ways for enhancing survivability of Sustainable Supply Chains (SSCs). This study has made an effort to develop a framework for enhancing survivability of SSCs to survive in and post-COVID-19 pandemic. This study has utilised Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) method for identifying the significant factors for enhancing survivability of SSCs to be focused in pandemic situation. The study revealed that ‘Supply Chain Network Viability (SCV)’ is the main criterion for managing buyer–supplier relationship and enhancing survivability of SSCs during and post-COVID-19 situation. This study is helpful for firms, suppliers, and other stakeholders to focus on the identified factors for healthier future. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. buyer–supplier relationship; COVID-19 pandemic; digital data-driven SCs; survivability; Sustainable supply chains (SSCs); viability  Impact of COVID-19 on logistics systems and disruptions in food supply chain An outbreak of deadly COVID-19 virus has not only taken the lives of people but also severely crippled the economy. Due to strict lockdown, the manufacturing and logistics activities have been suspended, and it has affected the demand and supply of various products as a result of restrictions imposed on shopkeepers and retailers. Impacts of COVID-19 are observed ubiquitously in every type of units from different sectors. In this study, a simulation model of the public distribution system (PDS) network is developed with three different scenarios to demonstrate disruptions in the food supply chain. Difficulties have been increased in matching supply and demand in a vast network of PDS because of changing scenarios with the growth of infected cases and recovery. This paper also highlights the importance of a resilient supply chain during a pandemic. Our proposed simulation model can help in developing a resilient and responsive food supply chain to match the varying demand, and then further assist in providing decision-making support for rerouting the vehicles as per travel restrictions in areas. Paper has been summarised with significant highlights and including future research scope for developing a more robust food supply chain network. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The end of an expansionary cycle of the economy, added to a very weak social structure, with unresolved pressing needs, does not represent the best scenario to confront the health alert situation. The objective of this work is to reflect on these aspects, warning of the absence of a solid regional architecture and its consequences. For this, the work reviews all the regional schemes of the continent and analyzes the way in which multilateral spaces have been arranged for joint decision-making. Thus, except for the Central American Integration System and the Pan American Health Organization, it is scarcely possible to find regional commitments beyond the exchange of information or concern about economic recovery. © 2020 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

Vaccine safety and efficacy requires meticulous testing and oversight; this paper describes how despite grandiose public statements, the current vaccine development, testing, and production methods may prove to be ethically dubious, medically dangerous, and socially volatile. The basic moral concern is the potential danger to the health of human test subjects and, eventually, many vaccine recipients. This is further complicated by economic and political pressures to reduce government oversight on rushed vaccine testing and production, nationalistic distribution goals, and failure to plan for the widespread immunization needed to produce global herd immunity. As this paper asserts, the public must be better informed to assess promises about the novel vaccines being produced and to tolerate delays and uncertainty. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

The impact of this crisis is even higher in emerging economies like India due to already slowing growth rates, poor health infrastructure, and a significant population living in extreme poverty. While the government is taking measures to handle this crisis, nobody can be sure if these measures are adequate, as this will depend on how soon the spread of the virus is contained in the country. However, understanding the depth of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy is vital to formulate the policy and measures to contain this economic impact. This paper attempts to understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the Indian economy by employing a qualitative research design, based on sentiment analysis to understand 15 industry experts' opinion concerning the socio-economic impact of COVID-19. The study makes a theoretical as well as applied contribution to the field of study. While theoretically, it contributes to the field of pandemic research, public health management, and disaster management; in an applied sense, we propose a set of measures for the policymakers based out in India, as well as in other emerging nations of the world. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd   War economy and the COVID-19 pandemic: Inequalities in stimulus packages as an additional challenge for health systems [краткое описание не найдено]  coronavirus disease 2019; economic aspect; financial deficit; funding; gross national product; health care system; health insurance; health workforce; hospital bed capacity; household; housing; human; income; industrial production; intensive care unit; isolation; learning; leishmaniasis; leprosy; Letter; low income country; middle income country; military phenomena; pandemic; poverty; sanitation; schistosomiasis; social distance; telemedicine; tourism; tuberculosis; unemployment; war economy; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; economics; health care planning; health care policy; organization and management; pandemic; socioeconomics; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Policy; Health Systems Plans; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Socioeconomic Factors Covid-19, international financial institutions and the continuity of androcentric policies in Latin America [Covid-19, instituciones financieras internacionales y continuidad de las políticas androcéntricas en América Latina] This article analyses, from a human rights and feminist economy perspective, the emergency financial policies deployed by the international financial institutions (IFIs)-in particular the IMF and the World Bank-to help States in Latina America to cope with the Covid-19 crisis. The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions as well as the underlying economic policies behind the loans that IFIs are granting to States are studied, identifying clear signals that fiscal discipline and pro-market options will continue being the priorities as soon as the emergency has been overcome. The study explains how the adjustment and austerity policies implemented in the countries in the region have adversely and disproportionally affected women's rights, in particular reinforcing the invisibilization of gender inequalities in the domestic and care work and how this situation, in turn, has put women in a situation of greater vulnerability to the pandemic. It also criticizes the (self)called ""gender approach"" of IFIs for being merely instrumental to economic growth without consideration to the intrinsic value of gender equality and women's rights. The responsibility of IFIs for complicity with economic reforms with known adverse effects on gender equality is studied. Given the policy and legal implications of the findings presented in this research, the article concludes that States in the region should consider carefully the conditions of the loans being offered by IFIs, for which it is crucial to conduct ex ante evaluations of the impact of these financial contacts on the human rights of the population, and in particular on gender equality. © Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

The stock market information of the top 32 coronavirus affected economies (as of 31st March 2020) was sampled for ex-ante and ex-post COVID-19 outbreak analysis using the Detrended Moving Cross-Correlation Analysis (DMCA) and Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) techniques. The results confirm a fractal contagion effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock markets. Furthermore, this fractal contagion effect fizzles out over time (in the middle and long run) for both the stock markets return and volatility. Therefore, this article provides pieces of evidence for the COVID-19 fractal contagion effect on the stock markets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

From developed to developing, no country has been spared from its brunt. In this paper, we have analyzed the implications of COVID-19 on the economy and society of India so far. An impact assessment on the basis of available lietrature is made on all the three sectors—primary, secondary and service sector along with the impact on migrants, health, poverty, job losses, informal sector, environment, and so forth. The all sectors of the economy has been disproportionately affected and even within a sector, there is a disproportionate loss. The societal impacts are dire too with job losses, mental illness, increased domestic violence, and so forth. Some positive effects can be seen in terms of improved air quality, water quality, wildlife but the sustainability of such impact is conditional upon post-COVID and people's habits and future policies related to the environment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd   A review on scope of immuno-modulatory drugs in Ayurveda for prevention and treatment of Covid-19 The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) infection attacking mainly on the immune system of a body. It is a potentially fatal disease that is of public health and economy concern globally. In December 2019, COVID-19 outbreak occurred in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China furthermore spread worldwide. Research is underway in many countries to develop effective vaccines and drugs for the COVID-19. In Ayurveda, Acharya Charaka explained the concept of an epidemic condition in Janapadodhwansa Adhayay and combating of these diseases is to be done by Panchakarma (five procedures of purification), Rasayana Chikitsa (immune-modulators therapy) and Sadvritta (good conduct). Rasayan dravyas (immunomodulator drugs) of Ayurveda can be used for health promotion, immune-modulation, prevention and reduce disease burden from COVID-19. Drugs such as Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal), Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers), Amalaki (Phyllanthus emblica L.), Mulethi (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.), Shatavari (Asparagus racemosus Willd.), Chireta (Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees), Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum L.) Punarnava (Boerhaavia diffusa L.) and Pippali (Piper longum L.) For symptom management of COVID-19 like illness Agastya Haritaki, Anutaila, AYUSH-64 can be used. Scientific research on these drugs may reveal the new approach for the prevention and management of COVID-19. The main aim of this article is to review research which has already conducted and currently being carried out on the herbal plant for their immunomodulation property which have a possible application in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. © Niraj & Varsha (2020).

Converging evidence from the current pandemic, previous outbreaks and controlled experiments indicates that SARS-CoVs are present in wastewater for several days, leading to potential health risks via waterborne and aerosolized wastewater pathways. Conventional wastewater treatment provides only partial removal of SARS-CoVs, thus safe disposal or reuse will depend on the efficacy of final disinfection. This underscores the need for a risk assessment and management framework tailored to SARS-CoV-2 transmission via wastewater, including new tools for environmental surveillance, ensuring adequate disinfection as a component of overall COVID-19 pandemic containment. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

This paper focuses on two inter-related phenomena: rising economic inequality and the diminution of liberal democracy, a feature common to both developed and developing countries set in the context of a ubiquitous and globalized capitalism. In the post-pandemic world, we need to harness the positive dimensions of the powerful capitalist system to lower inequality and build a newer world akin to an earlier golden age of capitalism. © 2020 Syed Mansoob Murshed, published by De Gruyter.

This paper presents the significant cluster events, relevant developments of innovation, and economical impact in Korea that could inform policy makers on how to respond to health crises in the future. Methods: Health care, economy, epidemiological data are collected from various sources including the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) or other government sources. Results: The KCDC jointly with medical professionals developed a series of innovations such as 1) Full contact tracing and rapid testing with a 12 h turnaround and 10 min movement tracking systems, 2) transparent disclosure of all contract tracing data to the public through a central database, 3) Drive-Through and Walk-Through testing methods, and 4) a 4 tier patient severity index and community treatment isolation centers. Korea moved from the 4th in the world for total confirmed cases in March down to 76th in August. Conclusions: Expedited enforcement of amended legislation acts to protect the healthcare workforce resulted in only 10 healthcare professionals contracting the virus while caring for Covid-19 patients. This has resulted in minimal human capital loss and the government was able to re-direct existing medical workforce to areas in need. The quarantine strategies implemented resulted in little need to lock down the whole economy but also limited the cost spent to gain a year of life to 193,848 Won (US$163). © 2020   A Spatio-Temporal Analysis of the Environmental Correlates of COVID-19 Incidence in Spain The novel SARS-CoV2 has disrupted health systems and the economy, and public health interventions to slow its spread have been costly. How and when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether SARS-CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means of a spatio-temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting insights. Higher incidence is associated with higher GDP per capita and presence of mass transit systems in the province; in contrast, population density and percentage of older adults display negative associations with incidence of COVID-19. © 2020 The Ohio State University   Families’ Financial Stress & Well-Being: The Importance of the Economy and Economic Environments The Great Recession and the unfolding COVID-19 Pandemic Recession—two major disruptions to the economy that occurred just one decade apart—unequivocally confirm the importance of the economy and economic environments for understanding families’ financial stress and well-being. However, recent published literature places too little emphasis on the economy and economic environments and instead focuses on explanations rooted within individuals and families. In this article, we review research on families’ financial stress and well-being published in JFEI between 2010 and 2019, which analyzed data collected during the Great Recession and were subsequently published in the shadow of the economic downturn. We discuss the economy and economic environments as gaps in the literature and encourage future research to focus on these explanations of stress and well-being, especially in response to the pandemic recession. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Method: A content analysis identified nine types of mitigation interventions and the timing at which states enacted these strategies. A proportional hazard model, a multiple-event survival model, and a random-effect spatial error panel model in conjunction with a robust method analyzing zero-inflated and skewed outcomes were employed in the data analysis. Findings: Contradictory to the study hypothesis, states initially with a high COVID-19 prevalence rate enacted mitigation strategies slowly. Three mitigation strategies (nonessential business closure, large-gathering bans, and restaurant/bar limitations) showed positive impacts on reducing cumulative cases, new cases, and death rates across states. Conclusion: Some states may have missed optimal timing to implement mitigations. Swift implementation of mitigations is crucial. Reopening economy by fully lifting mitigation interventions is risky. © The Author(s) 2020.

Purpose: Entrepreneurship, in many low-resilient economies, plays a critical role in overcoming external shocks. Thus, it is crucial in such situation that entrepreneurial firms can survive and even grow so that the whole economy can benefit from a higher level of resilience. The purpose of this study is to understand how entrepreneurial orientation (EO) brings about firms' performance through the moderating role of CEOs' self-transcendence values in the context of a low-resilient sanctioned economy. Design/methodology/approach: This is a quantitative research that employs hierarchical regression analysis of a sample of 114 Iranian entrepreneurial firms composed of 62 knowledge-based and 52 creative firms. Findings: The analysis revealed that in the low-resilient sanctioned economy, Iran, EO-performance link is moderated by the level of CEOs' self-transcendence value, that is, higher level of CEO self-transcendence leads to stronger impact of EO on performance. This moderation is not different in creative sector vs. knowledge-based sector of the economy. Originality/value: This paper addresses a major gap in the traditional EO-performance relationship which is related to the role of CEO values. Also, the context of Iran's low level of economic resilience adds more novelty to this study, emphasizing on the role of CEO personal values of self-transcendence in times of crisis. The results could also be generalized in many economies now facing the COVID-19 pandemic crisis during which CEOs' self-transcendence values are vitally important in overcoming the difficulties of doing business in such situation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The viruses have adapted to infect a large number of animal species, ranging from bats to camels. At present, seven CoVs infect humans, of which Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for causing the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. Since its emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly across the globe. Healthcare systems around the globe have been stretched beyond their limits posing new challenges to emergency healthcare services and critical care. The outbreak continues to jeopardize human health, social life and economy. All known human CoVs have zoonotic origins. Recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in pet, zoo and certain farm animals has highlighted its potential for reverse zoonosis. This scenario is particularly alarming, since these animals could be potential reservoirs for secondary zoonotic infections. In this article, we highlight interspecies SARS-CoV-2 infections and focus on the reverse zoonotic potential of this virus. We also emphasize the importance of potential secondary zoonotic events and the One-Health and One-World approach to tackle such future pandemics. © 2020 The Author(s).

This paper reviews literature on the negative impacts of the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU) as developed by Baker et al., The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2016, 131, 1593–1636 on individuals, businesses, governments, and economies at the local and international levels. This reveals that a high EPU is associated with adverse effects on households, corporations, and governments, which tend to delay many financial decisions under high uncertainty, which leads to lower consumption, fewer issuances of debt, fewer investments, and higher unemployment. The effects of political and regulatory uncertainty also extend to the commodity markets, such as the adverse effects on both oil and gasoline markets, and can potentially create adverse impacts on the crypto-currency market and its potential growth. We demonstrate that governmental uncertainty also affects financial, housing, and equity markets; debt issuances; and the entire economy. This underscores the importance of considering EPU as a risk factor. The association with several components of the global economy reflects not only the EPU index's critical influence, but also the importance of risk management. Our results lead us to consider the gravity of economic policy uncertainty and call for innovation across different sectors to mitigate its adverse effects. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Capital investment; corporate finance; economic policy uncertainty; macro-economic & microeconomics; risk management  The state and national competitiveness (The case of EU) The article aims to explore the possibilities and contribution of the state in ensuring the competitiveness of the economy of the EU countries. Various definitions of the concept of national competitiveness are presented as well as directions in which the state affects national competitiveness. Among the latter, state procurements of goods and services and their varieties are considered. Special importance of the indirect influence of the state on the country’s competitiveness in the form of creating favorable investment climate, pursuing structural policy, and establishing clear rules for doing business is emphasized. The analysis of the possibilities and methods of state regulation of business activities based on a number of indicators of international organizations is presented. The use of new opportunities by the state in the context of digitalization of the economy to ensure competitiveness is highlighted. The role of the state and PPP in the development of infrastructure, which serves as a guarantor and stimulator of national competitiveness, is examined. The conclusion is made that the role of the state in national competitiveness is increasing, especially under the spread of COVID-19. © 2020, Russian Presidental Academy of National Economy and Public Administration.

As on May 10, 2020, more than 4,153,300 people stand infected from the virus due to an unprecedented rate of transmission and 282,700 have lost their lives because of the disease. In this context, medicinal plants may provide a way to treat the disease by targeting specific essential proteins of the virus. We screened about 51 medicinal plants and found that Tea (Camellia sinensis) and Haritaki (Terminalia chebula) has potential against SARS-COV-2 3CLpro, with an IC50 for Green Tea as 8.9 ± 0.5 μg/ml and Haritaki 8.8 ± 0.5 μg/ml. The in-silico studies suggested that Tea component Thearubigins binds to the cysteine 145 of protease active site and could be a pharmacoactive molecule. We predict that the inhibition in protease activity may be able to halt the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and therefore, we propose Green Tea, Black Tea, and Haritaki plant extracts as potential therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation on role of bioactive constituents of extracts is needed to establish the molecular basis of inhibition and towards expedited drug discovery. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 3CLpro; Haritaki; medicinal plants; SARS-CoV-2; tea  The Final Frontier: China, Taiwan, and the United States in Strategic Competition for Central America China’s rise as a global power corresponded with a diminution of Taiwanese diplomacy, which has left Central America as the last region to host a continuous bloc of countries that recognize the ROC. In this article, we argue that China’s success in gaining diplomatic recognition from Taiwan’s former allies has largely resulted from China's economic policy, specifically its promises of large-scale infrastructure projects and the integration of Central American economies with Chinese markets. However, there are limits to how far China has advanced in gaining full recognition from the region. The competing political and economic interests of China, Taiwan, the United States, and the Central American countries themselves, continue to influence patterns of diplomatic switching. More specifically, we argue that the threat of punitive measures from the United States combined with a turn in Taiwanese diplomacy toward assistance efforts to combat Covid-19 may deter future switching in the short to medium-term. Our analysis offers case studies of four Central American countries (Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador and Nicaragua) to illustrate the multi-year processes by which China’s economic strategy leads to diplomatic switching and examine the paths ahead for the remaining holdouts facing the prospect of economic and political penalties by the United States. © 2020, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.

"7","20","Mental health key to tourism infrastructure in China's new megapark The global economic value of parks through improved mental health of tourists has been estimated at about ten times greater than direct park tourism expenditure. The Chinese term for this health services value is jing hua xin ling, psychological destressing. Here we present the first case where optimal tourist infrastructure is influenced by including mental health. Using a multi-stage, cross-lingual, differential stakeholder method, we analyse conflicts between road- and roadless-access tourism in the very large new Sanjiangyuan National Park, Qinghai, which offers jing hua xin ling to domestic tourists from eastern-seaboard cities. This provides a powerful tourism attraction, and hence economic opportunity, for the region around the park. If these mental health aspects are included, together with their direct and indirect consequences for tourism, then roadlessness is preferable to new roads. Similar infrastructure conflicts occur for park tourism worldwide, and jing hua xin ling can provide a global theoretical framework. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Adventure; COVID-19; Culture; Health; Protected area expenditure; global economy; health services; infrastructure; mental health; national park; tourism economics; tourist attraction; China; Qinghai; Sanjiangyuan Nature Reserve The People's bank of China's response to the coronavirus pandemic: A quantitative assessment The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has implemented numerous measures to cushion the impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis on the Chinese economy. Since the current monetary policy framework features a multi-instrument mix of liquidity tools and pricing signals, we employ a dynamic-factor modelling approach to derive a composite indicator of China's monetary policy stance. Our quantitative assessment shows that the PBoC's policy response to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has been swift and decisive. Specifically, our estimates reveal that the PBoC has implemented novel policy measures to ensure that commercial banks maintain liquidity access and credit provision during the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To proceed, panel regression models are first applied with a time-lag effect to estimate the general effects of COVID-19 on daily tourist arrivals. In turn, the data set is decomposed into two nation groups and fixed effects models are employed for addressing the comparison of the pandemic-tourism relationship between economies with and without experiences of the SARS epidemic. Specifically, Taiwan and Hong Kong are grouped as economies with SARS experiences, while Thailand and New Zealand are grouped as countries without experiences of SARS. The estimation result indicates that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has a significant negative impact on tourism demand, in which a 1% COVID-19 case increase causes a 0.075% decline in tourist arrivals, which is a decline of approximately 110 arrivals for every additional person infected by the coronavirus. The negative impact of COVID-19 on tourist arrivals for Thailand and New Zealand is found much stronger than for Taiwan and Hong Kong. In particular, the number of tourist arrivals to Taiwan and Hong Kong decreased by 0.034% in response to a 1% increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases, while in Thailand and New Zealand, a 1% national confirmed cases increase caused a 0.103% reduction in tourism demand. Moreover, the effect of the number of domestic cases on international tourism is found lower than the effect caused by global COVID-19 mortality for the economies with SARS experiences. In contrast, tourist arrivals are majorly affected by the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand and New Zealand. Finally, travel restriction in all cases is found to be the most influencing factor for the number of tourist arrivals. Besides contributing to the existing literature focusing on the knowledge regarding the nexus between tourism and COVID-19, the paper’s findings also highlight the importance of risk perception and the need of transmission prevention and control of the epidemic for the tourism sector. © 2020 by the authors.

To overcome this problem, countries have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people, business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects: (1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation, (5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2020 Agent-based simulation; COVID-19; Epidemic models; SEIR Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Diseases; Simulation platform; Viruses; Agent-based model; Input parameter; Non-pharmaceutical interventions; Python programming language; Social cooperations; Social isolation; Society of agents; Vertical isolation; Economic and social effects A projection for psychiatry in the post-COVID-19 era: potential trends, challenges, and directions The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the face of psychiatry over a very short time period. Given the detrimental impact of the pandemic on mental health and the economy, more difficult days are ahead for psychiatry. The rising public health burden of mental illnesses will inevitably exceed the capacity of psychiatric services in the United States and worldwide. The pandemic has also profoundly affected psychiatric research due to safety concerns and containment efforts. Intermediate and long-term ramifications may even be more serious. In addition to the effects of the economic downturn on available research funding, existing research tools and protocols may not meet the emerging needs in the post-COVID-19 era. This paper discusses potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter in this period from the viewpoint of workers in the field. We outline some measures that clinicians and researchers can implement to adapt to the emerging changes in psychiatry and to mitigate the forthcoming effects of the crisis. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, Dengue fever, Yellow fever, West Nile fever, Zika, and Chikungunya vector-borne diseases, Swine flu, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are examples of zoonoses that have spread throughout the globe with such a significant impact on public health that the scientific community has been called for a rapid intervention in preventing and treating emerging infections. Vaccination is probably the most effective tool in helping the immune system to activate protective responses against pathogens, reducing morbidity and mortality, as proven by historical records. Under health emergency conditions, new and alternative approaches in vaccine design and development are imperative for a rapid and massive vaccination coverage, to manage a disease outbreak and curtail the epidemic spread. This review gives an update on the current vaccination strategies for some of the emerging/re-emerging viruses, and discusses challenges and hurdles to overcome for developing efficacious vaccines against future pathogens. © Copyright © 2020 Trovato, Sartorius, D’Apice, Manco and De Berardinis. antibody-dependent enhancement; COVID-19; emerging infectious diseases; epidemics; pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; vaccines; viruses bacterial vaccine; CD47 antigen; DNA vaccine; hemagglutinin; hepatitis B surface antigen; live vaccine; neutralizing antibody; recombinant vaccine; subunit vaccine; virus vaccine; virus vector; COVID-19 vaccine; inactivated vaccine; antibody dependent enhancement; antibody response; avian influenza (H5N1); cross reaction; cytokine production; dendritic cell; dengue; Dengue virus; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; gene expression; health care personnel; hepatitis E; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; immunization; innate immunity; Lassa fever; liver injury; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; mortality; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Review; rheumatoid arthritis; sarcoidosis; SARS coronavirus; vaccination; virus infection; virus neutralization; virus particle; West Nile fever; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; Betacoronavirus; communicable disease; Coronavirus infection; immunology; pandemic; passive immunization; virology; virus pneumonia; Animals; Antibody-Dependent Enhancement; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Reactions; Humans; Immunization, Passive; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Vaccination; Vaccines, Attenuated; Vaccines, DNA; Vaccines, Inactivated; Vaccines, Subunit; Viral Vaccines The impacts of COVID-19 crisis over the tourism expectations of the Azores Archipelago residents Throughout history, times of crisis have always been preceded by periods of change. In fact, the current moment of health, economic, and social crisis that we are experiencing seems to be no exception. Tourism seems to be one of the most affected activities by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis-due not only the cancelled flights but also to the fear of being infected with the virus. In this sense, the present article intends to identify the Azores Archipelago residents' tourism expectations during the COVID-19 crisis. Using the Azores Islands as a case study and merging it with the authors' knowledge about this regional reality, it was possible to collect a substantial quantity of data. Thus, this study provides an in-depth perception of the main issues about how this pandemic crisis affects the tourism expectations of the Azores region residents, and consequently, how this situation will influence regional sustainable development. Through the study, it was possible to verify that the significant part of the Azores Archipelago residents (57.5%) will not be going to travel to spend vacations in 2020. Additionally, 84.2% will have holidays in the region; therefore, they stay in the Azores Archipelago. Besides, this study shows that majority of the respondents (61.6%) would not make a reservation for a 2020 vacation. © 2020 by the authors.

Some areas, like the Caribbean Basin, have yet to see the virus strike at full force. When it does, there is reasonable evidence to suggest the consequent COVID-19 outbreaks will overwhelm healthcare systems and economies. This is particularly concerning in the Caribbean as pandemics can have disproportionately higher mortality impacts on lower and middle-income countries. Preliminary observations from our team and others suggest that temperature and climatological factors could influence the spread of this novel coronavirus, making spatiotemporal predictions of its infectiousness possible. This review studies geographic and time-based distribution of known respiratory viruses in the Caribbean Basin in an attempt to foresee how the pandemic will develop in this region. This review is meant to aid in planning short- and long-term interventions to manage outbreaks at the international, national, and subnational levels in the region. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC coronavirus; pandemic; seasonal incidence air temperature; Caribbean; coronavirus disease 2019; disease predisposition; disease transmission; environmental factor; epidemic; geographic distribution; health care planning; health care system; human; infection prevention; nonhuman; pandemic; prediction; Review; seasonal variation; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distance; weathering Effects of Physical Distancing to Control COVID-19 on Public Health, the Economy, and the Environment Physical distancing measures are important tools to control disease spread, especially in the absence of treatments and vaccines. While distancing measures can safeguard public health, they also can profoundly impact the economy and may have important indirect effects on the environment. The extent to which physical distancing measures should be applied therefore depends on the trade-offs between their health benefits and their economic costs. We develop an epidemiological-economic model to examine the optimal duration and intensity of physical distancing measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. In an application to the United States, our model considers the trade-off between the lives saved by physical distancing—both directly from stemming the spread of the virus and indirectly from reductions in air pollution during the period of physical distancing—and the short- and long-run economic costs that ensue from such measures. We examine the effect of air pollution co-benefits on the optimal physical distancing policy and conduct sensitivity analyses to gauge the influence of several key parameters and uncertain model assumptions. Using recent estimates of the association between airborne particulate matter and the virulence of COVID-19, we find that accounting for air pollution co-benefits can significantly increase the intensity and duration of the optimal physical distancing policy. To conclude, we broaden our discussion to consider the possibility of durable changes in peoples’ behavior that could alter local markets, the global economy, and our relationship to nature for years to come. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

This disease has hugely affected healthcare systems as well as the economy to an extent never seen before. To date, COVID-19 infection has led to about 165000 deaths in 150 countries. At present, there is no specific drug or efficient treatment for this disease. In this analysis based on evidential relationships of the biological characteristics of MSCs, especially umbilical cord (UC)-derived MSCs as well as the first clinical trial using MSCs for COVID-19 treatment, we discuss the use of UC-MSCs to improve the symptoms of COVID-19 in patients. ©The Author(s) 2020.

As a result, there have been calls for the closure of China’s “wet markets”; greater scrutiny of the wildlife trade in general; and a spotlight has been placed on the potential risks posed by growing human populations and shrinking natural habitats for animal to human transmission of zoonotic diseases. However, to date there has been little attention given to what the consequences of the COVID-19 economic shock may be for the wildlife trade; the people who rely on it for their livelihoods; and the wildlife that is exploited. In this policy perspective, we argue that the links between the COVID-19 pandemic, rural livelihoods and wildlife are likely to be more complex, more nuanced, and more far-reaching, than is represented in the literature to date. We develop a causal model that tracks the likely implications for the wild meat trade of the systemic crisis triggered by COVID-19. We focus on the resulting economic shockwave, as manifested in the collapse in global demand for commodities such as oil, and international tourism services, and what this may mean for local African economies and livelihoods. We trace the shockwave through to the consequences for the use of, and demand for, wild meats as households respond to these changes. We suggest that understanding and predicting the complex dynamics of wild meat use requires increased collaboration between environmental and resource economics and the ecological and conservation sciences. © 2020, The Author(s).

Nevertheless, the negative local impacts of the pandemic will be particularly harsh for those parts of South Africa where tourism is a critical sector in the local economy. The objective in this article is to identify the tourism spaces of vulnerability in South Africa. Use is made of the IHS Global Insight data base for 2016 to analyse at a local authority scale the most vulnerable localities to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indicators used to isolate tourism spaces of vulnerability are total tourism spend; tourism spend as a proportion of local GDP; domestic and international tourism (trips and bednights); and, leisure, business and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travel. The analysis discloses those local authorities that are the most vulnerable to the downturn/collapse of tourism as a whole as well as to the hollowing out of specific forms of tourism, namely domestic as opposed to international travel, leisure as opposed to business or VFR travel. © 2020 AJHTL /Author(s).

Simply reviving the existing ‘brown’ economy will exacerbate irreversible climate change and other environmental risks. For G20 economies, investing in a workable and affordable green transition is essential. A good place to start is learning what worked and what did not from previous efforts to green the economic recovery during the 2008–2009 Great Recession, examining the cases of the United States and South Korea. Policies for a sustained economic recovery amount to much more than just short-term fiscal stimulus. Transitioning from fossil fuels to a sustainable low-carbon economy will require long-term commitments (5–10 years) of public spending and pricing reforms. The priorities for public spending include support for private sector green innovation and infrastructure, development of smart grids, transport systems, charging station networks, and sustainable cities. Pricing carbon and pollution, and removing fossil-fuel subsidies, can accelerate the transition, raise revenues for the necessary public investments, and lower the overall cost of the green transition. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

There is currently no specific treatment available for patients with COVID-19 infection. The lessons learned from past management of respiratory viral infections have provided insights into treating COVID-19. Numerous potential therapies, including supportive intervention, immunomodulatory agents, antiviral therapy, and convalescent plasma transfusion, have been tentatively applied in clinical settings. A number of these therapies have provided substantially curative benefits in treating patients with COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, intensive research and clinical trials are underway to assess the efficacy of existing drugs and identify potential therapeutic targets to develop new drugs for treating COVID-19. Herein, we summarize the current potential therapeutic approaches for diseases related to COVID-19 infection and introduce their mechanisms of action, safety, and effectiveness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Compared with its neighbors China and Iran, which were rated as epi-centers of the outbreak, Pakistan has lower standards of health care, unstable economy and dearth of financial resources to tackle the outbreak. Like other institutes and industries in the country, clinical laboratories were succumbed to a variety of challenges. This article is based on the experience and adapted workflow measures from the Clinical Chemistry laboratory at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Karachi, which serves as a national referral center with its widespread network of satellite laboratories and phlebotomy centers across the country. It highlights the challenges faced and the appropriate responses to ensure the provision of diagnostic facilities during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the lessons acquired and necessary preparations for the post crisis situation are also incorporated. © 2020 Challenges; COVID-19; Laboratory; Lessons; Pakistan accreditation; biochemical analysis; clinical laboratory; clinical practice; compensation; coronavirus disease 2019; developing country; disease surveillance; epidemic; good laboratory practice; health care policy; housekeeping; human; medical education; pandemic; point of care testing; priority journal; psychological well-being; quality control; Review; salary; social distance; virtual learning environment; work; workflow COVID-19 and Economic Growth: Does Good Government Performance Pay Off? The coronavirus pandemic led to substantial revisions of 2020 GDP growth projections. We analyse whether and to what extent the quality of government policies in handling the health aspects of the crisis influence cross-country differences in the economic impact of the pandemic as projected by the OECD, the IMF and the World Bank. We measure policy quality by a recently published Economist Intelligence Unit index and a COVID-19 Misery index combining the stringency of government-imposed distancing measures with the COVID-19 fatality rate. Moreover, we control for international spillovers captured by trade openness and export exposure to tourism. Results for most specifications show that good government performance pays off as the respective countries record less severe revisions of growth forecasts. Only in a few cases, our findings suggest that the pandemic’s global effect might be so strong that actions by individual governments do not affect cross-country differences of growth revisions. Finally, there is broad evidence supporting the view that a country’s exposure to the global economy influences its growth outlook relative to other countries. © 2020, The Author(s).   Influence of topography on sustainable land management: An analysis of socioeconomic and ecodemographic conditions of Nepal Around 6 to 8 million young Nepali, working abroad as migrant laborers, are contributing remittances of about 28% of the annual gross domestic product of Nepal. However, due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal is not only going to lose a significant portion of remittances but will also face the Herculean task of creating employment for the workforce who may return to Nepal. This paper discusses sustainable options for the Nepali government to help create employment for its citizens in Nepal through the revitalization of fallow lands and other potential agricultural areas, which are below a 15° slope. The land-use and land-cover data for the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s are derived from the classification of satellite images. These classified and resampled 30 m × 30 m images along with the 30 × 30 m elevation data are brought to the Kibana Platform within the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to analyze the status of land-use and-cover conditions for the 1980 to 2010 period within nine different slope classes at an interval of 5° slope. Our findings suggest there have been massive conversions of forested areas for agricultural land at lower slope areas between 1980 and 2000, but the trend began to reverse from 2000 to 2010 as trees started coming back to the fallow agricultural lands. This happened mainly because, during the countrywide Maoist insurgency period (1996–2006), many youth first took shelter in various urban centers away from their natal homes and then emigrated to foreign countries for remittance purposes. As a result, many farmlands became fallow and barren, and agricultural productivity decreased. Consequently, Nepal, an exporter of rice and pulses until the late 1980s, started importing food grain each year. The major goals of this research are to explore: (a) if Nepal can self-sustain in agricultural products by utilizing potential agricultural lands below a 15° slope in various geographic regions; (b) the means for productively engaging the youth returning to the country; and (c) methods of reinvigorating the ecosystem services of Nepal to support sustainable development. © 2020 by the authors.

We discuss the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental effects of shuttering the tournament and suggest that an understanding of the impacts of COVID-19 offers an opportunity to bring about an alternative, more sustainable sports tourism economy. The cancellation of March Madness resulted in the loss of millions of dollars in tourism revenue for local economies and deprived traveler-fans of pilgrimages to arenas, important socio-cultural gathering spaces for American basketball fans. However, it also prevented the emission of a sizable quantity of greenhouse gasses based on our carbon footprint calculated from the previous year’s tournament. Ultimately, from the disruptive closing down of sport and event tourism, a post-pandemic sports tourism landscape should emerge that takes more seriously the triple-bottom line notion of balancing a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with the creation and maintenance of resilient local economies all while both acknowledging the important role sport plays in society and keeping tourism actors healthy. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. carbon footprint; coronavirus; COVID-19; local economies; sport; Sustainable tourism COVID-19; economic impact; epidemic; health status; respiratory disease; sport; sustainability; tourism economics; tourism market; viral disease; United States; Coronavirus Editorial essay: Covid-19 and protected and conserved areas The COVID-19 pandemic is having a dramatic impact on the global community; on people’s lives and health, livelihoods, economies, and behaviours. Most zoonotic disease pandemics, including COVID-19, arise from the unsustainable exploitation of nature. This special editorial provides a snapshot of how protected and conserved areas around the world are being impacted by COVID-19. For many protected and conserved areas, negative impacts on management capacity, budgets and effectiveness are significant, as are impacts on the livelihoods of communities living in and around these areas. We provide a commentary on how effectively and equitably managed systems of protected and conserved areas can be part of a response to the pandemic that both lessens the chance of a recurrence of similar events and builds a more sustainable future for people and nature. We conclude the editorial with a Call for Action for the rescue, recovery, rebuilding and expansion of the global network of protected and conserved areas. © 2020, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

The public health emergency of international concern declares the agent as the (SARS-CoV-2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The COVID-19 pandemic has an unusual way of stroking the entire world. Crises have spread rapidly, disease load and casualties are still on the rise, and crisis influence is spreading across developing countries. Around the globe, the reactions, perceptions, and outcomes were distinct. The outbreak has reflected unfavourable mental health impacts and symptoms. This pandemic has also affected the healthcare department that is treating the patients suffering from diseases other than corona. The power and severity of slowdown varying from being temporary to a long-term recession, they are unanimous about the fact that the slowdown would have an intense impact amongst various sectors of the economy. Most importantly, some panic among consumers and firms has disfigured standard patterns of consumption and caused market inconsistency. This article would give the overall idea of how the social, economic, cultural, and psychological aspects influenced by the pandemic. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

This article considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gig economy sector, in particular on the work of bicycle couriers in Poland. The main research question is whether in this case the impact is positive (it is a ‘good’ occupation during the pandemic) or negative (gig economy has suffered the consequences of the lockdown just like all other sectors). In order to answer this question, I conducted 20 semi-structured online interviews with Glovo couriers in March and April 2020 and analysed 1300 posts on their internet forum. The analysis of the research material makes it possible to conclude that in the period of the pandemic and the lockdown of the Polish economy, working as a courier was at least a partial ‘remedy’ for the problems on the labour market. The couriers themselves generally did not feel the negative impact of the coronavirus on their occupational situation. © 2020 European Sociological Association.

We considered two scenarios. The first scenario has two channels of transmission over the economic system: a negative shock of labour supply due to the rates of morbidity and mortality caused by the pandemic, and a temporary shutdown of nonessential economic activities. The second scenario adds to the first the effects of the government fiscal package adopted to counteract the effects of COVID-19 on the economy. Furthermore, in both scenarios, a sensitive analysis related to the temporality of the shutdown is considered by assuming 3 and 6 months of shutdown. The results indicate a reduction of 3.78% in the national GDP growth rate in Scenario 1 and a reduction of 0.48% in Scenario 2, in 2020, with 3 months of shutdown. With 6 months, the reduction would be greater, 10.90% and 7.64% in Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, the government fiscal stimulus considered in this study partially mitigates the reduction in GDP projected under the COVID-19 outbreak. The study also presents sectoral projections at the national and state levels. The estimates indicate reductions in the GDP of most of Brazilian states in both scenarios. © 2020 The Author(s).

Initial evidence from regions in nine EU countries The novel coronavirus COVID-19 was brought to the global spotlight in early 2020 and has already had significant impacts on daily life, while the effects could last for a long period. However, these impacts appear to have been regionally differentiated, since similar to previous pandemics, geography plays an important role in viruses' diffusion. This paper enriches our knowledge about the initial territorial impact of the pandemic, from January to May 2020, studying the spread of COVID-19 across 119 regional economies in nine EU countries and explaining its underlying factors. Air quality, demographics, global interconnectedness, urbanization trends, historic trends in health expenditure as well as the policies implemented to mitigate the pandemic were found to have influenced the regionally uneven mortality rate of COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) are the main strategy to contain the pandemic. Unprecedented global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders are causing the most severe disruption of the global economy since World War II. With international travel bans affecting over 90% of the world population and wide-spread restrictions on public gatherings and community mobility, tourism largely ceased in March 2020. Early evidence on impacts on air travel, cruises, and accommodations have been devastating. While highly uncertain, early projections from UNWTO for 2020 suggest international arrivals could decline by 20 to 30% relative to 2019. Tourism is especially susceptible to measures to counteract pandemics because of restricted mobility and social distancing. The paper compares the impacts of COVID-19 to previous epidemic/pandemics and other types of global crises and explores how the pandemic may change society, the economy, and tourism. It discusses why COVID-19 is an analogue to the ongoing climate crisis, and why there is a need to question the volume growth tourism model advocated by UNWTO, ICAO, CLIA, WTTC and other tourism organizations. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, these sectors are vulnerable and sensitive to natural hazards such as the COVID-19 pandemic and any resultant economic downturns. This study investigates the impact of COVID-19 on the global restaurant industry using data from OpenTable and other sources. The study found that sit-in guests dropped to zero in many countries as governments across the world instituted social distancing initiatives, movement restrictions and lockdowns. COVID-19 also led to an unprecedented loss of employment and revenue, resulting in millions of jobs and billions of dollars in potential revenue lost. The work recommends extra-ordinary financial and other support measures for the sector. It further recommends a raft of safety and health protocols as the industry gradually reopens. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group. coronavirus; COVID-19; Hospitality industry; restaurants; tourism industry Coronavirus The impacts of Covid-19 pandemic on socio-economic mobility in Indonesia Purpose: The purpose of this article is to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on social and economic mobility occurring in Indonesia. The research illustrates that the effects of the pandemic are strongly felt in mobility in the socio-economic sectors. Design/Methodology/Approach: To give answer to the research question whether COVID-19 pandemic has impact on socio-economic mobility in Indonesia, firstly, we review the literature to find out what different scholars have found in recent researches concerning this subject as well as the current issue and the methods and models used in collecting, processing, and analyzing data. The processing of the data of the above-mentioned reports has been done by SPSS software program, specifically using regression. Findings: The possible impacts caused a decrease in socio-economic activities and reduced community income. The results of the correlation analysis showed that there was a strong relationship between a pandemic tested positive for COVID-19 and mortality rates with socio-economic conditions with an average correlation coefficient above 0.80. Practical Implications: This paper will provide a detail analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic mobility, with this impact, government policies relating to human life, economic policies to increase state expenditure (government expenditure), and tax incentives must be made. Furthermore, monetary policy that can accelerate the increase in production by reducing the cost of production through the cost of capital and reduce energy prices becomes an essential choice.

The pandemic has also caused significant and ongoing disruption to the economy, likely causing less work placement opportunities for upcoming years within the context of limited institutional budgets and resourcing. It is, therefore, vitally important that institutions develop diverse practices of WIL and shift away from a heavy reliance on work placements. Developing diverse WIL practices across educational institutions is an important strategy to build 'institutional WIL resilience' during times of disrupted economies with limited WIL opportunities. During the pandemic, the use of simulations had increased, in particular, in relation to preparing students for WIL, however, caution is needed in considering simulations as a comparable alternative to WIL. © 2020 International Journal of Work-Integrated Learning.

The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual screening of Selleckchem database was performed through ‘Virtual Work Flow’ (VSW) to find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential for application in COVID-19.

This represents a very significant challenge for tourism as a growth system. Much attention has been paid to different tourism subsectors such as aviation, accommodation, and activities to reduce emissions, mostly on the basis of (future) technology. However, the Paris Agreement demands immediate action and significant year-on-year progress on a zero-carbon trajectory. This article discusses destination management under the new low-carbon imperative. It analyses challenges, including economic viability and resilience, that have also gained importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and explores opportunities for better profitability on the basis of a leakage/spending value dichotomy proposition. The final section highlights the foremost role that destination managers must play in building prosperous and resilient low-carbon tourism destination systems and discusses the key insights for destination managers. © The Author(s) 2020. carbon management; climate change; COVID-19; destination management; resilience; value generation  Reconstructing tourism in the Caribbean: connecting pandemic recovery, climate resilience and sustainable tourism through mobility justice Caribbean islands that are highly dependent on tourism are facing compounding crises from climate-related disasters to the Covid-19 pandemic travel disruption. The rebuilding of tourism infrastructure has often been one of the main aims of international development aid and regional government responses to natural disasters. This article seeks to identify other ways in which Caribbean small island states and non-independent territories might rebuild more sustainable ecologies and economies as they come out of the pandemic within the ongoing climate crisis. The first part shows the historical grounding of climate change vulnerability in colonial histories, neoliberal capitalism and ongoing practices of “extractive” tourism. This analysis of the “coloniality of climate” centers on a critique of disaster tourism during these “unnatural disasters,” and allows for re-framing the ethical and political implications of tourism recovery when other human im/mobilities (such as migration) are severely curtailed. The article then elaborates on the theoretical concept of “mobility justice” as a way to think through the problem of sustainability transitions in relation to tourism mobilities, climate change and disaster recovery. The final section considers alternative visions for disaster reconstruction in the Caribbean centering food sovereignty, agroecology and regenerative economies, as promoted by community-based organizations and people’s assemblies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

There is widespread recognition that ecosystem disruption, including land-use change and illegal wildlife trade, is linked to the increasing emergence of zoonotic diseases. Here, we emphasize that protected areas play a fundamental role in buffering against novel disease outbreaks by maintaining ecosystem integrity. However, protected areas worldwide are facing increasing human pressures, which are being amplified by the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. Increased resources are thus urgently needed to mainstream a One Health approach to protected area management, focusing specifically on i) monitoring illegal wildlife trade, ii) biodiversity trends and iii) surveillance of zoonotic pathogens. Improving integration of public healthinto global biodiversity conservation policies should be a top priority to reduce the risk of future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.   Economic regulation and E-scooter networks in the USA This paper looks at the challenges in the economic regulation of stand-up electronic scooters, or “e-scooters”. The e-scooter represents one of several innovative modes that have emerged to cater for transportation needs in urban areas. They provide connectivity linking local origins and destinations, as well as interconnectivity linking urban locations to inter-urban networks. These vehicles are marketed as a micro form of public transportation designed to meet the needs of fit and able people wishing to make trips of two miles or less. They are touted as part of “micromobility” complementing existing transportation networks. This paper reviews the gray and limited academic economic literature looking at the viability and economics of e-scooters within the context of the regulatory environment in which they operate in US cities. It considers the ways regulatory structures are evolving as the authorities learn of the attributes and limitations of the mode. In doing this, the paper also makes comparisons with some of the other “novel” forms of local transportation that have emerged, including those offered by transportation network companies. The paper focuses on the pre-Covid-19 period. © 2020 Disruptive innovations; E-scooters; Economic core; Economic regulation; Gig-economy; Nudging; Sharing economy; Technical externalities  Economic impacts of innovations in tourism marketing Our paper tackles the novel issues of the economic impacts and innovations in tourism marketing in the 21st century. The paper examines the economic impact of tourism and its influence on the economy and the tourism industry in general from the angle of innovations in the tourism marketing and the new challenges for the tourism industry brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic that disrupted international tourism and caused major economic losses to the industry. We analyse the changes that the coronavirus pandemic made to the tourism industry and focus on the novel trends in tourism marketing that embeds the new informational technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), online Zoom tours, and other novelties that emerged after the lockdowns and social distancing imposed in the first half of 2020 in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus infection. Our results show that tourism marketing in the 21st century should be based on sustainable management and provide the right answers to questions about the impacts of tourism on the economy without sacrificing positive economic growth. We also show that information technologies might offer viable alternatives to massive international over-tourism and package tours ensuring both the safety of travel and deeper immersion into the travel experience before, during, and after the trip. Our outcomes might be useful for tourism scholars, policymakers, as well as stakeholders specializing in international tourism marketing. © 2020 Southern Federal University.

"8","24","COVID-19 and undeclared work: impacts and policy responses in Europe The Coronavirus pandemic has led to restrictions on movement and workplace closures, resulting in governments offering temporary financial support to enterprises and workers. This paper evaluates a group unable to access this financial support, namely those in the undeclared economy, and possible policy responses. To identify the service industries and workers involved, a late 2019 Eurobarometer survey of undeclared work in Europe is reported. This reveals that undeclared work is particularly prevalent in the hospitality, retail and personal services sectors and identifies the population groups over-represented. Given that this undeclared workforce is now largely unable to work, it will be argued that providing access to temporary financial support, through a voluntary disclosure initiative, would be a useful initiative not only to provide the income support these enterprises and workers need but also to bring them out of the shadows and put them on the radar of the state authorities. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

It discusses what is known about vulnerabilities and how to support local protective action. There is heightened concern about informal urban settlements because of the combination of population density and inadequate access to water and sanitation, which makes standard advice about social distancing and washing hands implausible. There are further challenges to do with the lack of reliable data and the social, political and economic contexts in each setting that will influence vulnerability and possibilities for action. The potential health impacts of COVID-19 are immense in informal settlements, but if control measures are poorly executed these could also have severe negative impacts. Public health interventions must be balanced with social and economic interventions, especially in relation to the informal economy upon which many poor urban residents depend. Local residents, leaders and community-based groups must be engaged and resourced to develop locally appropriate control strategies, in partnership with local governments and authorities. Historically, informal settlements and their residents have been stigmatized, blamed, and subjected to rules and regulations that are unaffordable or unfeasible to adhere to. Responses to COVID-19 should not repeat these mistakes. Priorities for enabling effective control measures include: collaborating with local residents who have unsurpassed knowledge of relevant spatial and social infrastructures, strengthening coordination with local governments, and investing in improved data for monitoring the response in informal settlements. © 2020 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). community–state relations; coronavirus; COVID-19; epidemic response; health data; infectious disease; informal settlements; urban health COVID-19; epidemic; health impact; health risk; infectious disease; public health; viral disease; Coronavirus The covid-19 crisis: Skills that are paramount to build into nursing programs for future global health crisis The COVID-19 pandemic started at the end of 2019 and can be considered one of the most difficult health crises of the past century. It has had a devastating effect around the world, not only for public health, but also for the economy, labor market, and other facets of individual and societal life. Health systems have been put under high strain, and health professionals have experienced unusual and stressful work circumstances. With the aim of drawing lessons for nursing education, the present study analyzed, during the weeks of peak infection in Spain, the stress experience and coping strategies of a sample of 403 nurses from the Spanish health system. Specifically, we analyzed how tenure, stress appraisal, problem-focused coping, and support-seeking coping predicted nurses’ awareness of their education needs, both in terms of technical-professional knowledge and skills and transversal skills. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that more tenure (years of experience) was related to lower stress appraisal (workload, −0.12, p < 0.05; insufficient preparation, −0.33, p < 0.001; and fear of contagion −0.36, p < 0.001) and more problem focused coping (PFC) strategies were related to higher awareness of professional (0.18, p < 0.01) and transversal educational needs (0.17, p < 0.01) while support seeking strategies just related to transversal training needs (0.10, p < 0.05). Moreover, the participants provided valuable input about specific contents to be considered in future nursing education programs. Implications for redesigning the nursing degree curriculum are analyzed in the discussion section. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Using data from 20 selected African countries, the study found that the reliance on local medicines alongside other salient global initiatives for containment of COVID-19 is effective in managing the pandemic in Africa. It concluded that despite the high vulnerabilities of African countries to COVID-19, the glocal approach has yielded positive outcomes by increasing the number of patients that recover from COVID-19 and scaling down the fatalities compared with the other regions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

When the solid waste management challenge is exacerbated by a public health emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic, its real significance as an essential service becomes more apparent. The outbreak and spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) has led to dramatic transformations of every sector of the Nigerian society including SWM systems, where formal and informal actors co-exist often in an uneasy relationship. Unfortunately, strategies for inclusive management of solid wastes during and after the Covid-19 pandemic are lacking in Nigeria, fuelling the further exclusion of informal sector in the waste governance and policy process in Nigeria. This paper reviews the state of the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria, identifies policy gaps in solid waste governance and highlights the linkages between Covid-19 and SWM with a view to catalysing inclusive solid waste governance and sustainability policy in Nigeria. It is argued that acknowledging the informal economy is the critical first step towards framing a sustainable SWM policy in which primary stakeholders are involved. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

In response, governments have made available temporary financial support to enterprises and workers affected. This paper evaluates a group currently excluded from this support, namely enterprises and workers in the undeclared economy, and a possible government policy response. To identify those involved, a 2019 Eurobarometer survey of undeclared work in Europe is reported. This reveals that one in every 132 European citizens relies wholly on undeclared earnings and the sectors and population groups involved. Given their reduced revenues and inability to access the temporary financial support, a voluntary disclosure initiative is recommended which brings undeclared enterprises and workers into the declared economy and onto the radar of state authorities by offering access to this temporary financial support if they disclose their previous undeclared work. © 2020 Colin C.

While research has paid considerable attention to the technical, epidemiological and public health aspects of the pandemic in Africa, it neglects the social, economic and political dimensions. Relying on analysis of data on trends of COVID-19 infections from the World Health Organization and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and a rapid review of available international and national policy/programme documents on COVID-19 control responses in Africa, this study assessed the extant protocols and responses to COVID-19 in relation to urban governance principles. Utilizing the political economy framework, the social conditions of informal labour and business activities during the COVID-19 pandemic are explored with accession to social habitus of informality. The paper argues that in as much as the COVID-19 pandemic is a pervasive health problem it should be treated more as a social and political economy challenge given the large informal nature of urbanism in Africa. The study concludes that urban governance that incorporates collective organization, community groups, non-state and informal actors offers scope in the battle against COVID-19 in Africa. Rethinking African urbanism in line with the principles of the Global Campaign on Urban Governance is also canvassed. © The Author(s) 2020.

Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to determine whether the Government of Jamaica's COVID-19 Allocation of Resources for Employees (CARE) Stimulus Response program provides a sufficient opportunity for formalization of the informal economy. Design/methodology/approach: A careful examination of the program has been conducted, specifically through reading the CARE brochure, reading the budget presentation by the Minister of Finance in which the program was introduced and details highlighted, following program updates at COVID-19 Press briefings and the Minister's Twitter account, and following related articles and programs via original and social media. Findings: This paper suggests that any capitalizing on the opportunity to promote formalization is insufficient. Early data show increased applications for licenses and registration by informal operators, but the CARE program is only short-term, and the benefits of formalization will have to surpass those of informality to be sufficiently attractive. Other attractors must necessarily involve simplifying the process of contributing to the National Insurance Scheme; and offering unemployment insurance; along with access to finance, education and training and policymaking opportunities. COVID-19 provides the possibility of a “new deal” for the informal economy that could yield productivity gains and more inclusive development. Originality/value: This is one of the earliest examinations of how the short-term financial support schemes implemented by the GoJ as its COVID-19 Stimulus Response has been used as an incentive to formalize the large informal economy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

The paper unpacks urban poverty in light of the corona virus. The emergence of the COVID-19 and the lack of any vaccines requires physical distancing as preventative measures to contain and reduce the spread of the virus. Governments across the world, including in Anglophone Sub Saharan Africa have implemented lockdown measures. The COVID-19 pandemic is happening within settlements where the majority of the population lives from hand to mouth. In Anglophone sub-Saharan Africa because of urbanisation and increased urban poverty, COVID-19 scourge has had a huge impact on the urban poor. The COVID-19 is likely to devastate economies and the community. For rapidly growing, densely populated and poorly planned settlements, the situation is tragic for these inhabitants. Nation states lockdown and social and physical distancing in response to the pandemic have escalated their misery. The paper adopts a critical review of literature anchored in case study analysis, document analysis and scanning from reports. Results point to redefining the way humanity has related, functioned and conceptualised realities. There is need to go beyond prevention from infection as majority of urban dwellers are in the informal sector or unemployed. For the urban poor, strategies for social distancing may not be possible or effective. People are being asked to make choices between being hungry and risk of getting infected. The paper recommends planning response at national, regional and local level bearing in mind informal settlements, high densities and forms of overcrowding which have been placed as hotspots for the virus. There is need for rebuilding societies, during and beyond COVID-19 calling for immediate disaster risk planning adaptation and transformation to promote resilience. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

Clinical evidences demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection produces detrimental levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and significant systemic organ damage. Currently, there is no definitive therapy for COVID-19 or associated complications, and with the hope of a safe and effective vaccine in the distant future, the search for an answer is paramount. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide a viable option due to their immunomodulatory effects and tissue repair and regeneration abilities. Studies have demonstrated that compassionate use of MSCs can reduce symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminate fluid buildup, and act as a regenerative technique for alveolar damage; all in a safe and effective way. With multiple autologous sources available for MSCs, each with their own respective limitations, allogenic umbilical cord (UC) and/or UC-derived Wharton’s jelly (WJ) seem to be best positioned source to harvest MSCs to treat COVID-19 and associated symptoms. As an allogenic source, UC is readily available, easily obtainable, and is rich in immunomodulatory and regenerative factors. In this manuscript, we reviewed the current evidences and explored the potential therapeutic use of allogenic UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. Although, preliminary preclinical and clinical studies indicate that their use is safe and potentially effective, more multi-center, randomized, controlled trials are needed to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of UC and/or WJ-derived MSCs for the treatment of COVID-19. © 2020, Japan Human Cell Society.

Comparatively, there are more success stories by SMEs in emerging markets. However, most SMEs operating in the informal sector in the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) face similar challenges that inhibit the adoption of advanced technologies and innovations needed to improve business operations and re-engineer processes. This article evaluates the implementation and use of state-of-the-art technologies by SMEs in EMDEs to improve operations performance and create sustainable competitive advantages. Further, the papers in this Special Issue identify FinTech and analytical algorithms as some of the current technologies employed by SMEs in EMDEs to improve operations and processes in the manufacturing and service industries. The recognized technologies and technical innovations that seem novel in EMDEs have long existed in the advanced economies. Most state-of-the-art technologies, including cloud computing, 'big data', and predictive analytics that can improve operations and strategic decisions, are yet to make inroads in most EMDEs. Also, disruptive computing technologies, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) required to engineer new business models, reduce overheads, enhance competitive advantages, and digitize SMEs' business operations remain untapped. The absence and non-adoption of digital technologies in EMDEs explain why business activities in most EMDEs remain shut during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the community lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategies to survive the 'new normal' imposed by COVID-19 and fierce global competition includes a successful adoption of advanced technologies. © 2020 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.

In response, governments have made available temporary financial support, but not to those tourist enterprises and workers in the undeclared economy. Reporting a 2019 Eurobarometer survey, this paper reveals that one in 165 European citizens engage in undeclared work in tourism and the groups involved. To bring these enterprises and workers onto the radar of the state, a voluntary disclosure initiative is advocated offering access to the temporary financial support for undeclared enterprises and workers disclosing their previous undeclared work. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd coronavirus; COVID-19; informal economy; public policy; tax evasion; tourism industry  Organizational participation in post-covid society–its contributions and enabling conditions The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the economic and social problems that societies face today. At the same time, the public response to the crisis points to a constructive way forward. It has brought people together and unleashed a desire to contribute in many ways, some small and others spectacular. It has demonstrated how opportunities for people to participate in collective activities both psychologically and behaviorally can achieve remarkable results, especially when addressing a common danger. This paper argues that it is timely to widen participation in organizational decision-making as an approach to addressing many of the problems which will continue to be with us post-Covid, and which indeed the pandemic has exacerbated. In order to arrive at practical policy options, it proceeds through the following stages. The first is to establish a working definition of organizational participation and to develop a framework for classifying its principal forms. This framework serves to identify the more advanced and consequential forms of participation, and is then used to structure an evidence-based review of how they can constructively contribute to economic and social improvement. The final part of the paper reviews conditions bearing on the practical implementation of participation and which serve to clarify practical policy implications. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the importance of beekeeping entrepreneurship in the country and the factors that affect entrepreneurship in this sector. Design/methodology/approach: This research was developed through a case presentation where interviews with beekeepers from different cities of Kosovo were conducted. Because this research was conducted during the pandemic situation COVID-19, a total of 32 beekeepers agreed to give interviews, of which 30 were males and 2 were females. The interviews were conducted from March to May 2020. All interviews were recorded to obtain all the relevant details during data processing. All respondents agreed that their names could be made public. The interviews were conducted in Albanian language, and their duration was from 32 min to 1 h and 40 min. The questionnaire for the interview in total contained 25 questions. Findings: Beekeeping in Kosovo runs entirely as a family business. Only 12 out of 32 respondents inherited the business from their families, while others started this business mostly out of curiosity. 59% of the respondents consider beekeeping as their primary income, while 32 percent as the only source of income. Only 9% of the respondents have less than 30 hives, and the beekeeping income does not have a big impact on their total income. Beekeeping is considered a dangerous business that forces beekeepers to have a second job. The most common risks are climate change and bee diseases. However, although they have a second job, their highest income derives from beekeeping. Education has the biggest role in the development of this business, while experience and technology do not play a significant role. Research limitations/implications: The number of respondents is small compared to the total number of beekeepers in Kosovo, so a larger number of beekeepers could give more accurate results. In addition, there is no general data on the impact of the beekeeping sector on the economy, especially on the role of this sector in reducing the unemployment rate. Originality/value: The study adds value to the importance of artisan family businesses. Knowing the importance of family businesses, this study makes a great contribution to determining the factors that affect the development of beekeeping entrepreneurship as family business. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

"9","25","Industrial policy for sustainable human development in the post-Covid19 era National and local societies all around the world are fighting the most dramatic global public health emergency of our time, which has soon become an economic, social and human crisis touching all key dimensions of our lives. Within an inevitable revamping attention on the need for government intervention to face the challenges raised by the Covid19 pandemic, industrial policy is appearing as a central piece of the puzzle. As production dynamics in every country is highly affected by the crisis, industrial policy is considered part of the response to solve dramatic economic and social problems deriving by extraordinary levels of unemployment, deprivation and poverty. In this paper, we argue that a turning point on the connection between industrial policy, sustainability and development has been reached, highlighting the need to rethink its theoretical foundations as well as its governance and implementation processes for a new role in our post-Covid 19 societies. Therefore, the research question underlying this paper deals primarily with the nexus between the debate on industrial policy and its effects in terms of human development, social cohesion and sustainability. For this reason, we attempt at closing the gap between different strands of literature, whose integrated connection leads to a new analytical framework with real-world implications on the role of industrial policy, not only as tool for productive dynamics, but also as a leverage for sustainable human development. All in all, we aim at contributing to the debate on our post-Covid19 economies and societies in two ways: firstly, by providing a new integrated analytical framework on industrial policy to steer a sustainable structural change of our economies and societies towards sustainable human development; secondly, by identifying preliminary implications on industrial policy governance and implementation, investing in the accurate and transparent design of industrial policy in the post-Covid19 era. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Covid19 pandemic; Government intervention; Industrial policy; Sustainable human development; Sustainable structural change COVID-19; human development index; industrial policy; state role; structural change; sustainability; sustainable development; viral disease COVID-19 and regional shifts in Swiss retail payments This paper analyzes card payments to the retail sector in Switzerland during the COVID-19 crisis. We provide evidence on aggregate effects and regional shifts. Pronounced shifts—which persisted post-lockdown—can be observed from urban to suburban and rural areas and among cantons. Data allow us to identify directly two sources of shifts: “tourists and business travelers” and “e-commerce.” We indirectly identify additional sources: infection risk, lockdown measures, working from home, shopping tourism, and cash substitution. The COVID-19 crisis seems to have reinforced pre-existing trends that may have faster than anticipated effects on the economy. Our analysis underscores the usefulness of real-time card payment data to inform policymakers. © 2020, The Author(s).

It emphasises that the cumulative nature of the impact of these two crises forces shifts in interest positions of important political actors (countries, sectors, social constituencies) to address issues of ‘systemic instability’ which pushes innovations in the policy instruments that become available at the EU level. Bargaining processes that characterise the negotiations and outcomes of these crisis responses are complex, they reflect differences in size and urgencies to come to agreements, and they have themselves differentiating impacts on relevant political actors. © 2020, Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.

Despite being symmetric in its very nature, the Covid-19 shock is affecting European economies in a very asymmetric way, threatening to deepen the divide between core and peripheral countries even more. It is not Covid-19 itself, however, but the contradictions within the EU’s growth model and institutional architecture that would be to blame for such an outcome. The dramatic impact of the economic crisis brought on by the pandemic and the threat that it poses to Eurozone survival seem to have forced a reluctant Germany into action: a minor step, but an important signal. This note analyses the crossroads currently facing Europe—the risk of disintegration vis-a-vis the opportunity for a ‘Hamiltonian moment’—discussing possible future scenarios in the light of past developments. © 2020, The Author(s). Core-periphery relations; EMU; Euro crisis; Global value chains  Employment impact of Covid-19 crisis: from short term effects to long terms prospects We contribute to the assessment of the employment implications of the COVID crisis by classifying economic sectors according to the confinement decrees of three European countries (Germany, Spain and Italy). The analysis of these decrees can be used to make a first assessment of the implications of the COVID crisis on labour markets, and also to speculate on mid and long-term developments, since the most and least affected sectors are probably going to continue to operate differently until a vaccine or other long-term solution is found. Using an ad-hoc extraction of EU-LFS data, we apply this classification to the analysis of employment in Germany, Italy and Spain but also UK, Poland and Sweden, in order to cover the whole spectrum of institutional labour market settings within Europe. Our results, in line with recent literature, show that the employment impact is asymmetric within and between countries. In particular, the countries that are being hardest hit by the pandemic itself (Spain and Italy, and also the UK) are the countries more likely to suffer the worst employment implications of the confinement, because of their productive specialisation and labour market institutions. Indeed, these were also the labour markets that were more vulnerable before the crisis: characterised by high unemployment and precarious work (especially temporary contracts). © 2020, Associazione Amici di Economia e Politica Industriale.

This article illustrates the mechanisms through which the COVID-19 pandemic affected GVCs in the context of a changing configuration of the global economy. In particular, it is argued that GVCs became the main transmission channels of “economic contagion”. Finally, we posit that the pandemic provides an opportunity to revive the role of industrial policy as to govern the landslides of a world economy constantly pressured by globalization and deglobalization forces. © 2020, The Author(s).

However, in addition to the uncertainty created by the introduction of new technologies, the current coronavirus pandemic, with its associated impact on health and the economy, has led to increased volatility across the globe. The global medical crisis arising from the worldwide spread of COVID-19 is predicted to lead to a global economic crisis and subsequent deep depression. The resultant economic, social and political repercussions are likely to be felt for years or even decades to come, equalling the great depression of the last century. Consequently, it is difficult to make long-term accurate predictions about the impact of new technologies on industry, society, and labour. In this context, the aim of this introductory article to the themed volume is to consider the potential challenges and opportunities associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and potential impacts on work and workplaces. This introductory article comprises an international collection of research that examines the impact of technological change on employment and working conditions with consideration given to the additional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

Evaluating the economic impact of “social distancing” measures taken to arrest the spread of COVID-19 raises a fundamental question about the modern economy: how many jobs can be performed at home? We classify the feasibility of working at home for all occupations and merge this classification with occupational employment counts. We find that 37% of jobs in the United States can be performed entirely at home, with significant variation across cities and industries. These jobs typically pay more than jobs that cannot be done at home and account for 46% of all US wages. Applying our occupational classification to 85 other countries reveals that lower-income economies have a lower share of jobs that can be done at home. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The novelty and topicality of this study is justified by the need to assess the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the European Union higher education system and its adaptability to switch from traditional to remote study forms. The objectives of the study were: 1) to analyse the need to improve digital skills in the European Union by investigating the achievements of the Digital Economy and Society Index; 2) to assess the current digital environment of Latvian public universities and conduct an in-depth study of the digital environment of Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. The research methodology is based on the desk study, social survey, comparative analysis and logical construction research methods. The results of the study revealed the digital gap that still exists between the more developed Nordic European countries and the less developed Southern and Eastern European countries. However, detailed analysis of the situation in Latvia leads to the conclusion that Latvian higher education institutions have significantly increased the amount of digital content in both external and internal communication systems and can offer competitive educational services that comply with the contemporary education requirements. © 2020 by the authors.

Disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19 will change the world in many ways and the road to redemption from the ongoing economic distress may require a novel approach. This paper proposes a path towards economic recovery that keeps sustainability at the forefront. A computable general equilibrium model is used to simulate different green tax reform (GTR) policies for triple dividend (TD), consisting of lower emissions, higher GDP and higher employment. The GTR design consists of an energy tax coupled with one of three tax revenue recycle methods: (i) reduction of payroll tax, (ii) reduction of goods and services tax (GST) and (iii) a mixed-recycling approach. The paper also presents the impact of higher productivity on the tax reform simulations, which is a possible positive externality of lower emissions. The study is based on the Australian economy and the salient findings are twofold: (i) productivity gain in the GTR context improves the GDP and employment outcomes in all three different simulation scenarios and (ii) GST reduction has the highest TD potential, followed by reduction of payroll tax. © 2020 by the authors.

During and after the crisis, there are opportunities and needs for remote work facilities, online services, delivery drones, etc. We discuss how unmanned technologies can cause a long-term employment decrease, and why compensation mechanisms may not work. Using the internationally comparable Frey–Osborne methodology, we estimated that less than a third of employees in Russia work in professions with a high automation probability. Some of these professions can suffer the most during quarantine measures; employment in traditional services can be significantly reduced. By 2030, about half of the jobs in the world and a little less in Russia will need to adapt during the fourth industrial revolution because they are engaged in routine, potentially automated activities. In the regions, specializing in manufacturing, this value is higher; the lowest risk is in the largest agglomerations with a high share of digital economy, greater and diverse labour markets. Accelerating technological change can lead to a long-term mismatch between the exponential increase in automation rate and compensating effects of retraining, new jobs creation and other labour market adaptation mechanisms. Some people will not be ready for a life-long learning and competition with robots, and accordingly there is a possibility of their technological exclusion. The term “nescience economy” and corresponding assessment method were proposed. Using an econometric model, we identified factors that reduce these risks: human capital concentration, favourable business climate, high quality of life and ICT development. Based on these factors, some recommendations for authorities were proposed in the conclusion. © 2020 The Author(s).

It has become a severe public health challenge to the world and established a public health emergency of international worry. This infectious disease has pulled down the economy of almost all top developed nations. The coronaviruses (CoVs) known for various epidemics caused time to time. Infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), followed by COVID-19, are all coronaviruses led outbreaks that scourged the history of mankind. CoVs evolved themselves to more infectious, transmissible, and more pandemic with time. To prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, many countries have ordered the complete lockdown to combat the outbreak. This paper briefly discussed the historical background of CoVs and the evolution of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), the case studies and the development of their antiviral medications. The viral infection encountered with present-day challenges and futuristic approaches with the help of nanotechnology to minimize the spread of infectious viruses. The antiviral drugs and their clinical advances, along with herbal medicines for viral inhibition and immunity boosters, are described. Elaboration of tables related to CoVs for the compilation of the literature has been adopted for the better understanding. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The study is developed within a multiscale framework accounting for the interaction of different spatial scales, from the small scale of the virus itself and cells, to the large scale of individuals and further up to the collective behaviour of populations. An interdisciplinary vision is developed thanks to the contributions of epidemiologists, immunologists and economists as well as those of mathematical modellers. The first part of the contents is devoted to understanding the complex features of the system and to the design of a modelling rationale. The modelling approach is treated in the second part of the paper by showing both how the virus propagates into infected individuals, successfully and not successfully recovered, and also the spatial patterns, which are subsequently studied by kinetic and lattice models. The third part reports the contribution of research in the fields of virology, epidemiology, immune competition, and economy focussed also on social behaviours. Finally, a critical analysis is proposed looking ahead to research perspectives. © 2020 The Author(s). complexity; COVID-19; immune competition; intracellular infection dynamics; living systems; multiscale problems; networks; SARS-CoV-2; spatial patterns; viral quasispecies; virus structure modelling Economics; Viruses; Collective behaviour; Critical analysis; Lattice models; Multi-scale frameworks; Multi-scale Modeling; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Social behaviour; Spatial patterns; Diseases Avaliacao de tecnologias em saude: Tensoes metodologicas durante a pandemia de Covid-19 Covid-19 is a global threat that attracts researchers from all areas to understand the natural history of the disease and its epidemiological parameters. The technological development of vaccines, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic targets has mobilized many resources in a short time. Health technology assessment (HTA), based on a systematic analysis of the properties, effects and/or impacts of health technologies through internationally-validated methods and instruments to assess the quality and methodological rigor of studies that demonstrate effectiveness, efficacy, and safety, is under unprecedented pressure due to the pandemic. This article also reflects on the emergency authorization of the use of treatments and diagnostic tests that conflict with HTA precepts. We will also evaluate non-pharmacological technologies of containment of the disease and their impacts on the domestic and international economy, as well as the judicial interventions that impact the decisions of managers in the exceptional context of the covid-19 pandemic. © 2020 Instituto de Estudos Avancados da Universidade de Sao Paulo.

It is justified that this crisis did not originate in the economy itself but that it is the result of the inability of modern medicine to cope with the coronavirus. Therefore, in this case, the economy is a hostage to medicine. It is shown that the coronomic crisis differs from those economic crises that also occurred in the twentieth century for non-economic reasons. In the post-crisis period, the problem of reducing the budget deficit will be especially acute for almost all countries. Apparently, central banks, especially in import-dependent countries, will have to abandon the inflation targeting regime. Particular attention is paid to the problem of the zombie-ing of the economy with anti-crisis methods of supporting companies that had to reduce or completely suspend their economic activity. One of the challenges of the post-crisis period will be such a change in bankruptcy legislation that will help to get rid of the economy of zombie-firms and zombie-banks. © 2020 Bull. Georg. Natl.

The impacts of this on the academic community as frontline providers of higher education are profound. In this article, we report the findings from a survey of n = 1148 academics working in universities in the United Kingdom (UK) and representing all the major disciplines and career hierarchy. Respondents report an abundance of what we call ‘afflictions’ exacted upon their role as educators and in far fewer yet no less visible ways ‘affordances’ derived from their rapid transition to online provision and early ‘entry-level’ use of digital pedagogies. Overall, they suggest that online migration is engendering significant dysfunctionality and disturbance to their pedagogical roles and their personal lives. They also signpost online migration as a major challenge for student recruitment, market sustainability, an academic labour-market, and local economies. © 2020, The Author(s).

This approach does not assume relevant political-economic aggregations ex ante (such as industries or ‘classes’); rather, it explores different possible ways of aggregating social groups and defining their interests depending on the situation under investigation. Moreover, interdependencies in the economy impose the need to keep conflicts within boundaries that are compatible with the viability of the system. Because sectors and groups can be aggregated in different ways, dynamics also depends on how actors represent the system and their position therein, and hence what they understand their interest to be. Different representations give rise to different definitions of competing interests and viability requirements, which in turn generate different endogenous dynamics of the political-economic system. The approach is illustrated through the examples of the Eurozone crisis and Covid-19 crisis. © 2020 Eurozone; Political economy of structural change; Special interest groups; Structural Political Economy; Systemic interest  Organizational participation in post-covid society–its contributions and enabling conditions The Covid-19 pandemic has intensified the economic and social problems that societies face today. At the same time, the public response to the crisis points to a constructive way forward. It has brought people together and unleashed a desire to contribute in many ways, some small and others spectacular. It has demonstrated how opportunities for people to participate in collective activities both psychologically and behaviorally can achieve remarkable results, especially when addressing a common danger. This paper argues that it is timely to widen participation in organizational decision-making as an approach to addressing many of the problems which will continue to be with us post-Covid, and which indeed the pandemic has exacerbated. In order to arrive at practical policy options, it proceeds through the following stages. The first is to establish a working definition of organizational participation and to develop a framework for classifying its principal forms. This framework serves to identify the more advanced and consequential forms of participation, and is then used to structure an evidence-based review of how they can constructively contribute to economic and social improvement. The final part of the paper reviews conditions bearing on the practical implementation of participation and which serve to clarify practical policy implications. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

"10","27","Pandeconomic crisis and its impact on small open economies: A case study of COVID-19 In the beginning of 2020, prevalence of coronavirus pandemic in the global world has raised an issue of replacing the existing economy with an alternative economy – pandeconomic (pandemic + economy), which unlike traditional economies will reduce environmental risks and losses and will focus on raising public welfare and social equality. Issues such as recession phase in which the economy will find itself, the increase in GIG economy and entire societies are discussed in the article. The article explores the problems associated with the onset of the economic crisis and the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in countries with small open economies (SOE). It was proved that the key challenges the small open economies countries will face are primarily the devaluation of the national currency, the massive closure of small and micro businesses, the growth of social problems, etc. The review of the literature, as well as reports from financial institutions, show that the economies of individual countries are entering a phase of stagnation and recession. In the coming years, the economy will be affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Freelancing will change nature of employment and working places will shift to GIG-economy. Exactly these factors will expectedly provoke the growth of socio-economic crises in the country. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Due to its fast dissemination, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020. Aiming to contain the spread of the virus, leaders of many countries restrained social movement, targeting to flatten the curve of contamination with social distancing. This review aimed to analyze how human behavior has changed throughout this period. We also approached the key components of the emotional reaction to the pandemic, how internal and external factors, such as personality traits, gender, the media, the economy and the governmental response, influence the social perception of the pandemic and the psychological outcomes of the current scenario. Moreover, we explored in depth the groups at increased risk of suffering mental health burden secondary to these circumstances. These include the healthcare professionals, elderly individuals, children, college students, black subjects, latin and LGBTQ+ communities, economically disadvantaged groups, the homeless, prisoners, the rural population and psychiatric patients. We also discussed several measures that might minimize the emotional impact derived from this scenario. It is crucial that the health authorities, the government and the population articulate to assist the vulnerable groups and promote emotional and psychological support strategies. Moreover, it is fundamental that the population is provided with accurate information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. © Copyright © 2020 Pedrosa, Bitencourt, Fróes, Cazumbá, Campos, de Brito and Simões e Silva. behavior; COVID-19; mental health; psychological changes; restricting measures; SARS-CoV-2; social isolation  Drinking to Cope During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of External and Internal Factors in Coping Motive Pathways to Alcohol Use, Solitary Drinking, and Alcohol Problems Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants (N = 320; 54.7% male; mean age of 32 years) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period beginning within 1 month of the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. Results: The results of a theory-informed path model showed that having at least 1 child under the age of 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use, and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and greater coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from having children at home, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Conclusions: Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer term outcomes of drinking to cope during the pandemic. © 2020 by the Research Society on Alcoholism Coronavirus; Drinking Motives; Social Distancing; Solitary Drinking; Stress  The role of digital media in shaping youth planetary health interests in the global economy Despite revolutionizing the work of practicing economists by providing a direct link between neo-classical economic theory and revealed market preference data, Random Utility Theory has yet to guide research applications in global market sustainability. With the worldwide adverse socio-economic effects of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), such application now becomes timely. Therefore, relying on a Random Utility theoretic formulation of youths' preferences for the biosphere (ecosystem services, sustainability) and science-based disease prevention to characterize their planetary health interests, this paper adopts a micro-based planetary view of markets to retrospectively analyze the health and ecological implications of digital media consumption among youths in the global economy. Empirically, we rely on a mixed bivariate ordered probit specification, which is estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Our findings reveal a strong, positive correlation coefficient (0.835) between youths' interests in the biosphere and science-based disease prevention. Moreover, digital media consumption in the form of increased frequency of ecological website visits, news blogs visits, and web-browsing on broad science, significantly reduce youths' interests in the biosphere. A similar reduction in youths' interest in science-based disease prevention is observed, from news blogs visits and web-browsing on broad science. Conversely, ecological website visits appear to raise youths' interests in science-based disease prevention. Furthermore, we find a gender-based gradient in youths' planetary health interest, in favor of the female gender. Overall, our findings confirm the appropriateness of a holistic view of health, and suggests a couple of policy implications for the long-term sustainability of our planet. © 2020 by the authors.

The link between environment and immunity is particularly intriguing as it is known that chemicals and drugs can cause immunotoxicity (e.g., allergies and autoimmune diseases). In this review, we emphasize the relationship between long-term exposure to xenobiotic mixtures and immune deficiency inherent to chronic diseases and epidemics/pandemics. We also address the immunotoxicologic risk of vulnerable groups, taking into account biochemical and biophysical properties of SARS-CoV-2 and its immunopathological implications. We particularly underline the common mechanisms by which xenobiotics and SARS-CoV-2 act at the cellular and molecular level. We discuss how long-term exposure to thousand chemicals in mixtures, mostly fossil fuel derivatives, exposure toparticle matters, metals, ultraviolet (UV)–B radiation, ionizing radiation and lifestyle contribute to immunodeficiency observed in the contemporary pandemic, such as COVID-19, and thus threaten global public health, human prosperity and achievements, and global economy. Finally, we propose metrics which are needed to address the diverse health effects of anthropogenic COVID-19 crisis at present and those required to prevent similar future pandemics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd Chronic diseases; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Epidemic; Immune deficiency; Pandemic; Pollutants; SARS-CoV-2; Xenobiotics angiotensin converting enzyme 2; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; fossil fuel; heavy metal; multi walled nanotube; pesticide; xenobiotic agent; antivirus agent; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; airborne particle; Article; biochemistry; biophysics; cell function; cell level; chronic disease; coronavirus disease 2019; dietary supplement; economic aspect; human; immune deficiency; immune system; immunopathology; immunotoxicity; intestine flora; ionizing radiation; lifestyle; long term exposure; macrophage; pandemic; particulate matter; pollutant; prevalence; protein expression; public health; risk factor; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; signal transduction; ultraviolet B radiation; virus immunity; vulnerable population; air pollutant; animal; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; diet; drug effect; epidemic; metabolism; pandemic; pathophysiology; prevalence; time; toxicity; virus pneumonia; Air Pollutants; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diet; Epidemics; Humans; Immune System; Pandemics; Pesticides; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Risk Factors; Signal Transduction; Time; Xenobiotics Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Consensus guidance As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and “staying at home” to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the ‘lockdown’ situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns. The present consensus guidance discusses these risks and makes some practical recommendations that may help diminish them. © 2020  anxiety; Article; behavior assessment; consensus; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; fear; gambling; game addiction; human; information technology; internet addiction; pornography; reinforcement; risk assessment; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; stress; substance use; treatment planning; anxiety disorder; Betacoronavirus; consensus; coping behavior; Coronavirus infection; Internet; pandemic; psychology; video game; virus pneumonia; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Humans; Internet; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Video Games The impact of COVID-19 on HIV treatment and research: A call to action The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far reaching, with devastating effects on individuals, communities, and societies across the world. People with chronic health conditions may be at greater risk of contracting or experiencing complications from COVID-19. In addition to illness or death for those who contract the virus, the physical distancing required to flatten the curve of new cases is having a negative impact on the economy, the effects of which intersect with mental health and other existing health concerns, thus affecting marginalized communities. Given that HIV also has a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, COVID-19 is affecting people with HIV (PWH) in unique ways and will continue to have an impact on HIV research and treatment after the COVID-19 crisis passes. Using the biopsychosocial framework to contextualize the impact of COVID-19 on PWH, the purpose of this review article is to: (1) outline the similarities and differences between the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics; (2) describe the current and future impact of COVID-19 on PWH; and (3) outline a call to action for scientists and practitioners to respond to the impact of COVID-19 on HIV prevention and treatment. © 2020 by the authors.

The COVID-19 outbreak occurred suddenly, and many countries were ill prepared to face it. Community behaviour has been altered due to the pandemic. Uncertainty surrounding the disease triggered panic buying; public panic caused additional worry about limited food supplies, and thus demand increased. World economies have also felt the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Owing to the measures put in place to address the spread of COVID-19, many service providers and industries were closed, resulting in financial losses, and the risk of unemployment was elevated, which inevitably increased negative emotions in individuals. A psychosocial consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is worldwide fear. Because psychological defence is a supporting factor for the recovery of COVID-19 patients, it is important to encourage prevention of mental stress. Psychotherapy is able to provide counselling services to the community through teleconsultation. Strengthening psychological defences can help countries fight against this disease. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Currently, the World Health Organization has declared SARS-CoV-2 (more commonly known as COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern. It is projected that the path of COVID-19 could kill 50–80 million people and impacts the world’s economy in its devastating global sweep. The surge is increasing on global and national levels, causing rapid loss of life, joblessness, deterioration of the healthcare systems, and both national and global economies. In Ethiopia, the first COVID-19 case was reported in March. Since then, the government has been taking different measures to prevent its spread. Locking down all schools, declared social distancing and hand hygiene, and restricting large gatherings were some of the Ethiopian government’s actions. Objective: To determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 pandemic among quarantined adults in Tigrai region, Ethiopia. Methods: A total of 331 participants selected using a systematic random sampling method were included in the study. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire. After describing the variables using frequencies, means, and standard deviations, multivariable logistic regression determined factors associated with knowledge and chi-squared tests for attitudes and practices towards COVID-19. Results: The study participants were primarily males (70%) and mean age 30.5 (SD=11) years. The mean knowledge score was 8.73 (SD=2.64), with less than half 42.9% (95% CI: 37.5–48%) of the study participants were knowledgeable. Regarding the attitude questions, three-fourths of the participants believed that Ethiopia will control and win the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly one-third of the participants replied that the Ethiopian government is handling this pandemic health crisis well. About half of the study participants reported that they had gone to crowded places in recent days, did not wear face mask when leaving home, and practiced preventive measures given by local health authorities. Knowledge score was statistically significantly associated with gender, age, and educational status of the study participants, whereas attitude and practices were significantly associated with educational status and knowledge of participants. © 2020 Haftom et al.

We performed partial correlation analysis and linear mixed effect modelling to evaluate the association of the spread rate and motility of COVID-19 with maximum, minimum, average temperatures and diurnal temperature variation (difference between daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperature) and other environmental and socio-economic parameters. After controlling the effect of the duration since the first positive case, partial correlation analysis revealed that temperature was not related with the spatial variability of the spread rate of COVID-19 at the global scale. Mortality was negatively related with temperature in the countries with high-income economies. In contrast, diurnal temperature variation was significantly and positively correlated with mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Taking the country heterogeneity into account, mixed effect modelling revealed that inclusion of temperature as a fixed factor in the model significantly improved model skill predicting mortality in the low- and middle-income countries. Our analysis suggests that warm climate may reduce the mortality rate in high-income economies, but in low- and middle-income countries, high diurnal temperature variation may increase the mortality risk. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2 weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

For some, location-aware applications are primarily a producer of geospatial Big Data required for vital geospatial analysis and visualization of the spread of the disease in a state of emergency. For others, comprehensive tracking of citizens constitutes a dangerous violation of fundamental rights. Commercial web-based location-aware applications both collect data and—through spatial analysis and connection to services—provide value to users. This value is what motivates users to share increasingly private and comprehensive data. The willingness of users to share data in return for services has been a key concern with web-based variants of the technology since the beginning. With a focus on two privacy preserving CoViD-19 contact tracking applications, this survey walks through the key steps of developing a privacy preserving context-aware application: from types of applications and business models, through architectures and privacy strategies, to representations. © 2020, The Author(s).

Early strategic planning and groundwork for evolving and established challenges are crucial to assemble resources and react in an appropriate timely manner. This article, therefore, focuses on the public perception of comparative lockdown scenario analysis and how they may affect the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the strategic management regime of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh socio-economically as well as the implications of the withdrawal of partial lockdown plan. Scenario-based public perceptions were collected via a purposive sampling survey method through a questionnaire. Datasets were analysed through a set of statistical techniques including classical test theory, principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, Pearson’s correlation matrix and linear regression analysis. There were good associations among the lockdown scenarios and response strategies to be formulated. Scenario 1 describes how the death and infection rate will increase if the Bangladesh Government withdraws the existing partial lockdown. Scenario 2 outlines that limited people’s movement will enable low-level community transmission of COVID-19 with the infection and death rate will increase slowly (r = 0.540, p < 0.01). Moreover, there will be less supply of necessities of daily use with a price hike (r = 0.680, p < 0.01). In scenario 3, full lockdown will reduce community transmission and death from COVID-19 (r = 0.545, p < 0.01). However, along with the other problems gender discrimination and gender-based violence will increase rapidly (r = 0.661, p < 0.01). Due to full lockdown, the formal and informal business, economy, and education sector will be hampered severely (R = 0.695). Subsequently, there was a strong association between the loss of livelihood and the unemployment rate which will increase due to business shutdown (p < 0.01). This will lead to the severe sufferings of poor and vulnerable communities in both urban and rural areas (p < 0.01). All these will further aggravate the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in the country in the coming months to be followed which will undoubtedly affect the Bangladesh targets to achieve the SDGs of 2030 and other development plans that need to be adjusted. From our analysis, it was apparent that maintaining partial lockdown with business and economic activities with social distancing and public health guidelines is the best strategy to maintain. However, as the government withdrew the partial lockdown, inclusive and transparent risk communication towards the public should be followed. Recovery and strengthening of the health sector, economy, industry, agriculture, and food security should be focused on under the “new normal standard of life” following health guidelines and social distancing. Proper response plans and strategic management are necessary for the sustainability of the nation. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.
